these
are
only
the
second
pair
of
openbacked
headphones
i've
owned,
and
my
very
first
planar
magnetics
i've
always
been
closed
back
or
iem
user,
mostly
from
necessity
in
the
time
leading
up
to
choosing
my
very
first
pair
of
openback
phones
the
philips
fidelio
x2's
well
worth
listen
tried
lot
of
headphones
and
before
purchase
read
fair
amount
too
frankly
the
choice
can
be
overwhelming
and
it's
not
helped
by
so
many
wildly
conflicting
opinions
one
person
will
tell
you
the
m1060's
are
utter
tripe,
the
next
will
say
they're
the
dogs
danglies
you
begin
to
second
guess
yourself
those
opinions
are
based
on
so
many
things
sound
preferences,
hearing
ability,
the
revision
of
headphone
they
have,
the
equipment
they're
using
to
drive
the
headphones
even
noticed
something
can
only
call
snobbery
some
people
seemed
almost
threatened
by
headphones
that
cost
so
much
less
than
the
headphones
they
own
and
to
which
they're
being
compared,
there's
lot
of
snippy
audeze
owners
out
there
out
of
all
the
headphones
looked
into,
the
m1060's
seemed
by
far
the
most
divisive;
they'd
been
hyped
to
the
hilt
and
were
subjected
to
incredible
scrutiny
the
internet
is
wonderful
resource,
but
for
certain
products
it's
often
more
confusing
than
informative
and
here
am,
adding
my
two
centsthe
only
way
of
knowing
if
you
like
something
like
headphones
is
to
put
them
on
and
listen
so
that's
what
did
prior
to
buying
have
friend
with
an
enormous
array
of
audio
equipment,
and
headphones
in
particular
in
trying
out
his
headphones
found
that
cost
often
had
nothing
to
do
with
how
much
enjoyed
listening
to
them
chose
the
philips
fidelio
x2's
blind
he
was
plopping
them
on
my
head
from
the
back
so
had
no
idea
what
was
on
there
and
when
it
came
to
take
them
off
was
seriously
smitten
then
saw
how
well
they
were
made
and
figured
was
gonna
be
spending
quite
chunk
of
change
turns
out
they
cost
me
150
new,
there
was
plenty
of
money
left
over
and
decided
to
buy
another
pair
that
used
different
driver
type
planar
magneticso
the
blind
testing
started
again
you'd
think
was
imposing
on
my
mate
but
he
loves
this
stuff
and
whittled
the
smaller
field
down
to
two
headphones
that
had
exactly
the
kind
of
sound
like
open
and
detailed
but
not
bright;
warm
with
nice
tight
solid
low
end
and
there
really
wasn't
much
between
them,
there
was
difference
but
it
wasn't
significant
enough
for
me
to
have
clear
preference
they
both
sounded
great
and
were
very
comfortable
examined
the
build
quality
of
both
and
while
the
m1060
wasn't
as
solid
as
the
others,
when
learned
the
price
made
the
decision
that
wasn't
going
to
pay
another
500
if
didn't
have
to,
especially
as
they're
for
home
use
and
will
spend
most
of
their
time
in
the
supplied
case
which
is
very
nice
but
bloody
huge
they
were
so
similar
otherwise,
and
the
build
is
certainly
good
enough,
so
it
just
didn't
make
any
sense
to
spend
more
than
had
to
they
look
very
smart,
they're
extremely
comfortable,
and
they
come
in
at
price
that
belies
their
appearance
and
sound
quality
was
almost
beginning
to
think
that
had
preference
for
cheaper
headphones
until
learned
the
price
of
the
similar
sounding
alternative
my
friend
assured
me
that
they
and
the
x2's
were
excellent
headphones
and
advised
me
to
just
trust
my
ears
after
all
its
me
who's
going
to
be
listening
to
them
if
you
ever
get
the
chance
to
test
products
blind
like
that
then
take
it
can't
count
the
times
i've
gone
with
the
high
end
brand,
the
top
model
or
the
most
expensive
"because
it
must
be
the
best",
only
to
be
left
feeling
duped
once
the
dazzle
wore
off
and
reality
kicked
in
off
topic
know,
but
google
"pricing
placebo"
and
"perceived
value"
it's
an
eyeopeneranyway
i've
been
living
with
the
m1060s
for
while
now
and
they
really
are
superb
headphone
they're
not
just
great
for
the
money,
and
when
you
look
at
the
price
of
other
planar
magnetics
you'll
see
what
mean,
they're
just
plain
great
once
they're
on
your
head
they're
really
comfortable,
those
big
thick
wide
earpads
really
hug
your
head
and
they're
easy
to
adjust
to
fit
the
sound
from
planar
driver
is
actually
quite
difficult
for
me
to
describe,
it
is
distinctive
from
the
dynamic
drivers
most
of
us
are
used
to
they're
also
physically
very
different
at
over
10cm
tall
they
have
very
clean
sound,
voices
and
instruments
seem
more
natural
and
vocals
in
particular
sound
wonderfully
sweet
the
midrange
is
very
detailed
i'm
bit
treble
sensitive
and
the
m1060s
suit
me
perfectly
with
their
slightly
quieter
highs
one
of
the
perhaps
less
obvious
advantages
get
from
them
is
speed,
which
might
sound
like
an
odd
thing
to
say
bass
in
particular
sounds
punchy
and
accurate
maybe
the
nature
of
the
driver
allows
it
to
recover
more
quickly
than
dynamic
driver
so
it's
ready
to
do
its
thing
again
they
might
not
have
the
thump
of
particularly
bassy
dynamic
headphone,
but
they're
absolutely
no
slouch
at
the
bottom
end
they
extend
all
the
way
down
and
what's
there
is
cleaner
i've
never
heard
the
double
bass
or
drums
sound
so
lifelike
and
defined
in
mix,
and
it's
easy
to
pick
out
each
individual
instrument
and
its
location
sub
bass
from
music
or
films
or
film
music
is
eerily
like
subwoofer
just
to
be
clear
though
they're
not
the
type
of
headphone
that
adds
bass
to
everything,
they
just
deliver
it
incredibly
well
when
it
should
be
therei'm
chatty
type
so
if
you've
stuck
with
me
this
long
then
cheers
just
wanted
you
to
know
that
did
what
could
to
buy
headphones
that
really
enjoy
and
tried
not
to
let
anything
but
the
sound
of
them
guide
me
did
my
due
diligence
before
actually
going
ahead
with
the
purchase
by
learning
what
could
about
them,
but
i'd
enjoyed
them
so
much
that
barring
learning
they
were
radioactive
it
was
forgone
conclusion
i've
forcibly
thrust
them
onto
every
friend
and
family
member's
head
can
and
watch
their
faces
light
up
with
smiles
and
surprise
far
better
gauge
than
anything
they
can
say
i'm
going
to
keep
an
eye
on
future
audio
products
from
monolith
because
think
that
they,
along
with
many
of
the
chinese
audio
companies,
are
going
to
shake
up
an
industry
where
its
not
unusual
to
find
headphones/dacs/amps
that
cost
in
the
thousands,
and
often
for
no
apparent
technical
superiority
it's
gotten
out
of
handnext
stop
for
me
is
pair
of
electrostatic
headphones,
for
many
audiophiles
they're
considered
the
best
type
of
driver
for
detail
the
planar
magnetic
is
generally
considered
to
sit
somewhere
between
the
dynamic
and
electrostatic
in
terms
of
audio
reproduction,
but
of
course
that's
not
always
true
they're
closer
to
electrostatics
in
both
in
quality
and
design,
but
cost
less
and
are
far
more
convenient
too
as
they
don't
need
specialist
amp
can't
recommend
the
m1060s
highly
enough,
they
not
only
sound
fantastic
but
monoprice
also
give
5yr
guarantee
and
are
no
nonsense
when
it
comes
to
customer
service
would
highly
recommend
that
you
at
least
try
them
out
for
yourself,
amazon
are
also
no
nonsense
so
there's
nothing
to
lose
hope
something
in
this
ramble
was
at
least
slightly
useful
and
that
it
might
have
swayed
you
to
give
the
m1060's
chance
don't
think
you'll
regret
it,
happy
listening
:
decent
sound
for
the
price,
gives
you
taste
of
the
low
end
energy
and
detail
that
proper
planar
has
lows
and
mids
are
pretty
good
and
clean
enough
but
the
higher
up
you
go
the
worse
the
rollercoaster
and
the
overall
sound
quality
gets
while
these
are
definitely
not
bright,
the
peaks
in
the
high
region
are
fatiguing
the
unevenness
of
the
higher
end
of
mids
and
highs
prevents
giving
these
an
unconditional
recommendation
while
the
sound
is
okay
the
build
quality
is
not
the
angled
pads
are
very
soft/thin
pleather
with
soft
non
memory
foam,
easily
knuckles
tall
and
plenty
deep
to
fit
your
ears
the
pads
are
just
fine
comfort
wise,
but
the
glue
keeping
them
on
failed
almost
immediately
and
from
the
looks
of
it
the
pleather
cover
is
slowly
starting
to
come
undone
too
the
metal
headband
is
really
thin
and
cheap,
the
suspension
strap
is
quite
narrow
and
has
insufficient
padding
this
was
for
me
the
main
cause
for
discomfort
over
longer
listening
sessions
yokes
are
the
sturdiest
part
of
the
construction,
but
they
have
unrestricted
movement,
this
with
the
flimsy
headband
makes
handling
awkward
the
wooden
ring
looks
alright
from
afar
but
hands
on
the
veneer
does
not
really
scream
premium
as
much
as
you'd
probably
hope
it's
okay
and
it
does
not
really
matter
what
matters
is
that
the
wood
is
prone
to
cracking
and
mine
did
just
that
from
where
the
yokes
connect
to
the
rings
while
this
is
mainly
cosmetic
defect,
it
is
bit
concerning
and
disappointing
the
grill
is
okay
and
mine
does
not
have
any
sharp
edges
what
is
not
cosmetic
defect
is
broken
plastic
clamp
that
is
supposed
to
keep
the
yokes
on
the
headband
hindsight
is
20/20
but
this
is
an
obvious
weak
point,
one
that
has
after
only
~6
months
failed
me
and
rendered
the
headphones
in
two

of

all
for

not

pretty

it
is

the

only
uses
one
of
the

whereas,
when
made
my
lead
up,
used
two

channelyes,
buy
these
cans,
you
will
not
be
disappointed
personally
think,
that
for
the

retail
price
of

these
cans
can't
be
beaten,
even
more
so
for
the

of

but
then
again
there
will
probably
be
others

little

this
has
nothing
to

the

eutronics,

little
concerned
with
the

supportyou

had
question
for
them
about
the

they
use,
despite
emails
to
them,
have
still
not
receiveda
reply
from
them
sent
the
question
to
them
before
had
even
brought
the
cans
can't
personally
compare
this
to
anything
more
expensive,
as
it
is
now
my
most
expensive
headphone
but
cried
little
the
first
time
heard
these
as
part
of
my
setup
i'm
very
happy
i'm
large
man,
with
fat
head,
so
personally
feel
like
this
headphone
is
light,
it
doesn't
clamp
down
hard
on
my
ears,
and
like
that,
can
easily
forget
they
are
there
when
relaxing
the
open
back
on
this
is
the
best
have,
only
my
hifiman
from
drop
compare,
it
doesn't
feel
like
have
headphones
on,
the
open
design
really
makes
it
feel
like
could
be
listening
to
my
speakers,
they
feel
incredibly
openso
it
goes
without
saying,
everyone
near
you
can
hear
these
if
you
use
them,
and
you
can
hear
them
aswell,
keep
that
in
mind,
if
you
have
kids
constantly
running
around
these
aren't
for
youbut
if
you
have
some
alone
time,
and
can
use
these
without
disturbing
anyone
or
getting
disturbed,
would
personally
recommend
these
how
do
monoprice
do
it
how
are
they
able
to
sell
highend
hifi
headphone
for
mere
227
recall
the
original
retail
price
was
somewhere
around
350,
if
i'm
not
mistaken,
and
at
that
price
the
monoloith
m1060
was
bargain
whatever,
the
monolith
m1060
planar
magnetic
sounds
superb;
they
are
very
well
built
and
look
stunning
this
is
the
improved/upgraded
version
with
the
25mm
jack
plugs
and
can't
fault
the
build
quality
or
the
finish
on
these
'phones
if
these
headphones
had
"sennheiser"
stamped
onto
the
side
of
their
aluminium
and
wooden
ear
capsules
then
they'd
retail
at
four
times
the
price,
at
least
i've
heard
some
bad
things
and
some
good
things
about
these
headphones,
but
it's
all
good
from
where
i'm
sitting
the
quality
control
issues
are
thing
of
the
pasti
own
the
sennheiser
hd600/650/660s
and
the
beyer
dt1990/dt880
600ohm
headphones
so,
the
monolith
m1060
faces
some
stiff
competition
from
some
of
hi
fi's
headphone
legends
how
does
it
stackup
sonically
this
is
very
neutral
sounding
headphone
which
doesn't
throw
the
music
at
the
listener
quad
electrostatic
loudspeakers
have
similar
sonic
signature
to
planar
drive
units
some
listeners
find
quads
too
laidback
and
lacking
in
low
frequency
extension
but
for
ultimate
transparency,
an
electrostatic
loudspeaker
can't
be
beaten
and
this
is
the
monolith
m1060's
forte
it's
transparent
and
very
revealing
transducer
that
will
only
perform
at
its
best
with
good
quality
hifi
equipment
don't
be
fooled
by
the
"easy
to
drive"
50
ohm
impedance;
had
been
using
sennheiser
300
ohm
headphones
and
needed
to
increase
the
volume
on
my
musical
fidelity
m1
headphone
amplifier
so,
the
monolith
m1060
isn't
suitable
for
lowpowered,
portable
device
use,
in
my
opinion
suffice
it
to
say,
once
these
monolith
m1060's
were
plugged
into
my
headphone
amplifier
the
other
headphones
in
my
collection
were
immediately
"put
out
to
pasture"
they
have
been
mothballed
yes,
the
monolith
m1060
is
giant
killer
they
have
sparkling
highs
and
sledgehammerlike
low
frequency
extension
classical
music
is
well
served
by
these
'phones;
that
transparent
and
revealing
midrange
will
astonish
for
listening,
used
my
musical

spinning
the

you
are
considering
purchase,
don't
hesitate
at
the
current
asking
price,
the
monolith
m1060s
are
steal
and
that's
an
understatement
and
as
say
above,
monoprice's
quality
control
has
improved
no
"floppy"
headband,
no
cracks
in
the
wood
and
no
sharp
edges
on
the
earcups
these
headphones
punch
well
above
their
weight,
and
for
the
price
you'll
not
find
better
pair
of
headphones
in
fact,
you'll
not
find
better
pair
of
headphones
at
twice
the
price
wanted
to
love
thesei
researched
these
1060's
for
what
seemed
like
forever
before
finally
ordered
themfirstly
want
to
state
that
these
are
heavythe
headband
is
beyond
jokewhen
buy
pair
of
headphones
expect
the
headband
and
cups
to
to
work
with
each
otherear
cups
to
have
gentle
clamp
made
possible
by
the
headbandwell
like
said
the
1060's
are
heavy
the
headband
does
not
do
it's
job
clamping
the
cups
and
what
you
get
is
the
cups
sliding
down
to
the
top
of
your
ears
and
the
top
of
your
head
holding
all
the
weightas
the
headband
top
is
practically
square
then
they
have
lot
of
pressure
on
the
very
top
of
your
headthe
tension
for
me
after
about
10
minutes
use
got
worse
with
each
passing
minutei
ended
up
moving
them
back
and
forward
with
no
reliefthe
sound
well
these
are
budget
planars
but
the
sound
is
pretty
remarkable
everything
including
flac,dsd,
320kbps
to
even
128kbps
files
sound
greatthe
bass
is
excellent
and
the
sound
very
neutral,
the
only
real
let
down
is
the
treble
which
is
very
recessedthese
are
one
of
the
most
reviewed
planars
out
there
so
have
just
stated
what
was
bothering
me
monoprice
has
to
do
something
about
the
headband,
it
really
lets
these
down
there
is
literally
no
clamping
to
your
earslike
said
wanted
to
love
these
but
after
week
reluctantly
had
to
send
these
back
these
took
my
by
surprise
better
than
oppo3,
although
some
recordings
sound
better
with
them
my
reference
pair
has
been
shure
1540,
these
are
different
but
so
far
have
not
been
able
to
put
them
in
orderif
you
are
after
outlandish
soundstage,
these
are
you
cans
if
you
thought
akg
k701
had
wide
soundstage,
these
are
possibly
even
wider
the
case
included
is
massive
and
impractical
though,
probably
fills
pretty
much
the
trunk
of
nissan
micra
the
most
polarizing
headphone
that
came
out
in
2017
seems
like
you
either
love
it
or
hate
it
with
reviews
going
from
bad
to
greatbuild
and
comfort:lets
start
with
the
obvious
they
aren't
built
that
great
and
has
had
issues
on
launch
headband
sucks,
it's
cheap
thin
metal
with
thin
padding
on
the
strap
the
actual
cups
aren't
too
bad
nice
matte
black
grill,
the
wood
looks
nice
too
the
pads
are
glorious,
not
memory
foam
but
who
cares
because
they
are
absolutely
huge
and
soft
nice
and
soft
fabric
for
the
cable
so
it
stays
straight
it's
25mm
to
the
headphones
with
regular
35mm
jack
to
connect
to
whatever
you
have
the
headband
really
is
built
that
bad
to
the
point
of
making
the
whole
thing
feel
lot
cheaper
the
pads
are
glued
on
tooas
quick
note
on
the
v1s
the
v1
had
major
issues
wood
cracking
metal
grills
were
sharp
the
connectors
on
the
headphones
were
prone
to
failing
since
they
were
the
tiny
mmcx
connector
that
iems
use
head
strap
was
prone
to
coming
off
too
all
of
it
fixed
with
the
v2
easiest
way
to
tell
if
you
have
the
v2
from
looks
is
the
cable
mmcx
was
replaced
with
25mm
jackdespite
the
thin
padding
on
the
headband
found
them
very
comfortable
the
pads
did
make
me
sweat
bit,
not
problem
with
the
headphone
imo
since
every
other
headphone
with
closed
pleather
pads
does
this
to
me
did
end
up
buying
zmf
auteur
perforated
sheepskin
pads
to
put
on
these
to
fix
that
issuesound:punchy
bass
that
extends
very
low
as
expected
of
planar
very
wide
and
due
to
the
size
of
the
headphone
the
general
sound
sounds
well,
big
then
you
get
the
the
upper
mids
+
treble
rough,
fatiguing,
uncontrolled
it's
bit
of
mess
really
there
are
many
times
where
it
all
sounds
great
but
then
there
are
times
where
it
sounds
harsh
which
is
real
shame
and
yes,
alot
of
sound
does
leak
from
the
headphonethere
is
potential
with
it
in
which
the
modding
community
really
brings
it
out
the
basic
mod
called
the
"fuzzor"
mod
involved
sticking
bit
of
felt
around
the
grills
behind
the
earpads
which
really
does
good
job
of
fixing
most
of
the
issues
with
the
sound
but
the
fact
that
it
had
to
be
done
doesn't
bode
well
for
the
headphone
did
do
this
with
my
pairhowever
for
275
as
of
writing
this
review,
for
that
price
the
sound
is
pretty
darn
great
ignoring
the
mod
rough
around
the
many
edges
but
275
for
budget
open
back
planar
that
sounds
like
this
is
good
deal
imofinal
thoughts:it's
my
daily
driver
and
really
do
like
it
but
would
recommend
it
really
want
to
say
yes,
but
it's
no
yes
the
headband
build
is
bad
enough
to
bring
the
whole
build
thing
down
the
fact
that
it
requires
modding
to
reign
in
the
upper
mids
and
highs
is
deal
breaker
for
alot
of
people
for
me
don't
mind
tinkering
with
it
but
not
everyone
does
if
you
do
then
sure,
go
for
it
for
everyone
else
no
even
if
the
price
is
at
good
275not
only
that
the
m1060c
which
is
the
closed
back
variant
with
modified
driver
supposedly
fixes
the
sound
issues
for
the
most
part
more
expensive
but
no
modding
required
why
do
call
it
risk
to
buy
these
headphones
well
there
one
of
the
most
'controversial'
sounding
cans
in
the
audiophile
world
people
either
think
there
unlistenable
or
there
the
best
sounding
headphone
this
side
of
1000
by
the
rating,
you
could
probably
tell
where
stand
on
the
matter
forget
what
you've
heard
understand
the
irony,
buy
these
before
any
other
and
see
where
you
land
if
its
anything
like
me,
then
your
search
for
the
best
midfi
cans
pretty
much
stop
there
there
great
for
gaming
too
for
the
sake
of
comparison,
also
tested
the
fidellio
x2
and
the
akg
k712,
and
these
where
the
best
in
my
mind
mine
sounded
great,
but
could
hear
some
movement
in
one
of
the
earcups
to
be
fair
the
customer
service
was
get
prompt
and
honest
felt
about
the
shortcomings
of
this
budget
end
of
the
high
end
productpurchase
for
studio
use
mixing
down
but
not
really
fit
for
my
purpose
if
you
are
looking
for
just
'home
listening'
high
end
audio,
then
they
are
great
set
you
won't
get
bass
response
and
depth
like
this
from
another
300
set
of
headphones
also
own
pair
of
pionset
hd2000
mk1
that
cost
over
300
when
bought
them
and
the
monoprice
blows
the
socks
off
the
pioneers
in
terms
of
sound
quality
acknowledging
they
are
designed
for
different
situationsa
good
introductory
pair,
but
ended
up
going
with
pair
of
audeze
lcd2's
purely
down
to
the
build
the
monoprice's
don't
sound
patch
on
the
sound
of
the
lcd2's
to
to
be
fair
they
cost
more
than
twice
the
price
just
received
these
at
work
today
and
was
pretty
excited
to
give
them
go
packaging
was
pristine
with
no
seals
unbroken
opened
the
box
up
to
find
what
you
see
in
the
photo's
27599
spent
and
that's
what
got
delivered
assume
its
mold
all
over
it
and
in
the
grooves
of
the
headphones
pretty
poor
and
shows
lack
of
professionalism
in
operations
as
for
the
soundwell
don't
think
will
be
trying
this
pair
for
sure
these
are
exceptional
can't
fault
them
and
better
sounding
than
my
sennheisers
that
were
more
than
double
the
price
early
reviews
on
the
previous
version
had
picked
up
some
faults,
but
monoprice
have
fixed
them
all
cannot
rate
these
highly
enough
make
sure
you
buy
the
amended/corrected
version
with
the
standard
connector
not
the
mini
conector
well
done
monolith
for
correcting
every
issue
raised
bought
this
headset
after
lot
of
research
about
what
headsets
are
great
for
hearing
foot
steps
in
games
and
oh
boy
these
are
amazing,
they
are
really
good
in
cod
and
apex
legends
overall
comfy
crisp
pro
headphones,
just
have
in
mind
you
will
need
an
external
mic
if
you
are
going
to
have
them
for
gaming
sound
quality,
looks,
packaging
are
excellent
apparently
there
are
some
issues
with
the
build
quality
and
the
cable
connections,
however
it
too
soon
to
comment
on
that
have
not
had
any
issues
so
far
recommend
these
headphones
to
anyone
who
starts
their
audiophile
journey
le
ho
acquistate
dopo
aver
letto
decine
di
forum
tutti
sembrano
concordare
sul
fatto
che
siano
le
migliori
magneto
planari
in
questa
fascia
di
prezzo
al
costo
di
un
paio
di
beats

mie
precedenti
cuffie,

le
sto
paragonando,
vi
portate
casa
delle
cuffie
il
cui
diretto
paragone
sono
le

che
costano
più
del

dubio
il
perfetto
primo
paio
di
cuffie
hifi
per
chi,
come
me,
è
nuovo
di
questo
mondo,
per
chi
cerca
delle
cuffie
highend
ad
un
prezzo
abbordabile
incredibile
soundstage,
si
riesce
percepire
ed
isolare
molto
bene
ogni
strumento
singolarmente
anche
quando
ce
ne
sono
molti
che
suonano
contemporaneamenteparlando
di
comodità
padiglioni
sono
molto
morbidi
grandi,
coprono
tutto
l'orecchio
senza
toccarlo
l'unico
difetto,
per
così
dire,
che
mi
sento
di
far
notare,
è
il
packaging,
davvero
non
adatto
ad
un
prodotto
di
questo
prezzo;
mi
piace
pensare
che
abbiano
sorvolato
sul
packaging
per
sfruttare
fino
all'ultimo
centesimo
nella
qualità
audioinoltre
altra
pecca
è
sicuramente
il
case,
che
è
molto
rigido
protettivo,
ma
esageratamente
grande
ok
che
non
sono
cuffie
pensate
per
essere
portate
in
giro,
ma
quasi
fatico
trovare
un
cassetto
in
cui
possa
entrare
if
you
don't
mind
relatively
flat
base
and
the
sound
leakage
of
open
headphones
can't
go
wrong
for
this
price

muchos
decían
que
sonaban
tan
bien
como
algunos
otros
que
cuestan
tres
veces
más
puedo
confirmar
que
son
realmente
estupendosen
mi
colección
faltaban
unos
audífonos
magnetoplanares;
durante
varios
meses
estuve
analizando
cuáles
me
convendrían
sin
gastar
una
enormidad
me
decidí
por
los
m1060
no
son
los
más
cómodos,
pero
pesar
de
su
peso
no
son
incómodos,
no
son
los
que
dan
más
detalle
pero
tienen
muy
buena
claridad,
el
escenario
musical
es
amplio
sin
exagerar,
con
buena
distribución
de
los
instrumentos
voces
es
el
conjunto
de
sus
cualidades
lo
que
ofrece
una
experiencia
musical
con
naturalidad
balance
en
el
rango
de
frecuencias,
sin
estridencia
ni
aburrimiento
sin
embargo,
monoprice
parece
sufrir
de
un
control
de
calidad
un
poco
irregular,
no
tanto
como
otra
marca
muy
famosa
de
audífonos
orthodinámicos
que
se
deshacen
en
las
manos
los
primeros
que
recibí
sufrían
de
un
defecto
que,
aunque
no
es
muy
común,
es
un
tanto
molesto
si
reciben
unos
sin
defectos
no
se
arrepentirán
estos
m1060
pueden
parecer
caros
pero
valen
más
de
lo
que
cuestanquiero
mencionar
que
amazon
ofrece
un
servicio
sin
igual,
tanto
en
la
venta
como
después
de

otro
detalle

es
el

al

lo

this
was
the
strangest
set
of
headphones
i've
ever
owned
ended
up
returning
them
after
just
over
week
of
using
them
the
wood
rings
wanted
to
crack
just
by
looking
at
them
the
wrong
way
the
headband
and
hinges
creaked
any
time
you
moved
them,
and
quite
literally
felt
as
though
they
would
just
crumble
or
fall
apart
in
your
hands
the
cable
was
of
extremely
poor
quality,
and
the
right
angle
adapter
was
bit
perplexing
as
well
the
25mm
connections
to
the
headphones
themselves
were
extremely
tight
and
required
terrifying
amount
of
pressure
to
snap
them
into
place
or
remove
them
the
headband
adjustment
system
stripped
paint
whenever
you
adjusted
the
fit
of
the
headphones
this
actually
felt
more
like
an
early
stage
prototype
rather
than
complete
product
there
is
just
no
way
that
competent
manufacturer
would
allow
qa
issues
like
this
onto
the
market,
unless
it
was
rushed
out
the
door
or
the
designers
just
didn't
care
enough
something
was
definitely
amiss
here,
at
any
rateall
those
issues
aside
and
then
some,
the
sound
quality
is
what
stood
out
to
me
the
most
here
these
things
sound
great
or,
at
least
my
pair
did
for
the
most
part
but
at
around
day
3,
started
noticing
my
ears
would
begin
to
fatigue
after
around
30
minutes
and
was
getting
headaches
after
a/b'ing
through
some
other
headphones
own,
realized
that
these
headphones
were
producing
harsh
resonances
or
reflections
whenever
really
exciting
part
of
track
would
play
female
vocals,
loud
guitar
parts,
ringing
snare
drums
anything
with
lot
of
energy
out
front
in
mix
created
lot
of
resonant
harshness
to
the
sound
good
number
of
owners
have
claimed
there
are
issues
with
5k
resonance,
harsh
tones,
shouty
mids,
etc
as
well,
so
at
least
wasn't
alone
in
that
regard
the
fact
that
some
headphones
sound
fine
while
others
are
terrible
also
speaks
volumes
about
the
qa
over
at
monopricethen
there
are
the
insane
amount
of
mods
that
users
are
coming
up
with
in
forums
to
essentially
fix
nearly
every
aspect
of
these
headphones
from
fuzzor/fazor
mods
around
the
drivers,
to
replacing
the
foam
with
folded
paper
towel,
to
3dprinted
grills
and
aftermarket
pads
to
get
rid
of
the
harsh
resonances
inside
the
earcupsi'm
sorry,
but
monoprice
should
not
have
to
rely
on
its
customers
to
try
and
fix
these
for
them
it's
unacceptable
to
charge
people
$400
for
an
incomplete
product
the
amount
of
money
some
people
have
put
into
these
on
top
of
their
already
hefty
price
tag
trying
to
fix
them
is
pretty
incredibleunless
you're
looking
for
project
or
an
experience
of
learning
how
to
repair
and
modify
headphones,
i'd
avoid
these
like
the
plague
struggled
to
find
the
value
in
this
sort
of
investment
of
time
and
money,
and
ultimately
ended
up
returning
these
it
truly
is
damn
shame
that
monoprice
couldn't
have
been
bothered
to
invest
more
time
engineering
these
properly,
because
they
were
certainly
onto
something
great
here,
but
fell
far
short
of
the
finish
line
lo
primero
es
decir
que
dispongo
de
unos
dt990

se
me
acababan
de
estropear
unos
dt770

que,
al
estar

amazon,
con
su

me
permitió
un

para
comprar
otros
auriculares
nuevos
dado
que
tuve
un
problema
de
calidad
con
los
dt770
he
preferido
probar
con
estos
monolith
1060
aunque
estaba
encantado
con
los
dt770
comparados
con
los
990
pierden
por
goleada
los
990
son
más
naturales,
detallados,
aireados
tan
solo,
mejoran
en
los
bajos
en
que
no
tienen
ciertas
sibilancias
con
los
agudos
pero,
para
eso,
estaban
los
770
que,
aparte
de
ser
120
euros
más
baratos
son
más
dinámicos
con
unos
bajos
mucho
más
entretenidos
son
contar
que
son
infinitamente
más
cómodos
no
entiendo
cómo
nadie
menciona
la
comodidad
en
sus
análisis
y,
en
este
punto,
los
beyerdynamic
son
excepcionales
devuelvo
estos
monolith
vuelvo
pedir
los

these
headphones
are
pure
pleasure
they
are

this

the
only
thing
is
the

just
be
careful
and
don't
drop
them
on
the

it
might
brake
but
even
the
wood

are

these
headphones
are
the
equivalent
of

game
that
is
amazingly
fun,
but
loaded
with
glitchesthese
cans
sound
excellent,
no
doubt
they're
slightly
better
than
my
already
phenomenal
hd
650s,
especially
the
soundstage,
cymbals
and
bassbut
unfortunately
the
build
quality
is
bad
it's
not
just
below
average,
it's
real
bad
the
headband
looks
bad
and
it
scratches
itself
when
you
adjust
the
height,
and
it
squeaks
when
you
flex
the
cups
aroundeven
worse
is
the
45
khz
ringing/whistling
noise
have
to
spend
$100
just
to
mod
and
replace
the
earpads
because
monolith
is
too
lazy
to
do
proper
testing
and
quality
control
most
of
my
music
is
just
unbearable
once
you
notice
this
piercing
whistling
sound
and
i'm
astounded
that
this
company
thought
these
headphones
were
ready
for
launch
own
revision
two
and
despite
them
fixing
several
issues,
many
still
remaini
will
fix
these
headphones
myself
and
i'm
sure
after
more
time
and
money
they
will
sound
the
way
they
were
supposed
to
sound
flawless
unfortunately
unless
people
are
willing
to
either
live
with
these
unacceptable
issues
or
mod
the
cans
themselves,
could
never
recommend
these
headphones
to
my
friends
knowing
the
nonsense
they'd
have
to
put
up
with
may
never
buy
another
monoprice
headphone
again
due
to
how
frustrated
am
with
this
pairyes,
they
do
sound
excellent
and
for
the
price
the
sound
quality
is
remarkableexcept
for
the
45khz
ringing
which
effectively
ruins
80%
of
my
music
monoprice
should
be
embarrassed
with
themselves
as
good
as
they
are,
these
cans
are
dreadfully
overrated
and
warn
people
to
please
exercise
extreme
caution
when
considering
buying
these
cans,

si

tanto

los

no
es
tan
molesto
pero
está
ahí
puede
repararsea
ver
qué
depara
el
tiempo,
que
esto
del
hifi
es
un
vicio
i'll
keep
it
short
there
is
single
thing
would
change
here
and
that
is
the
headphone
jack
it
broke
after
few
months
and
had
to
solder
it
shut
everything
else
about
this
headphones
simply
defeats
the
competition
by
long
shot
if
you're
looking
for
great
sounding
open
back
headphones,
you
won't
find
better
headphones
than
these
under
times
the
price
bought
these
headphones
because
they
are
one
of
the
few
contenders
at
this
price
range
and
wanted
an
upgrade
from
my
58x
jubilee's,
and
trust
me
these
are
what
like,
these
headphones
have
very
nice
sound
quality,
especially
at
this
price
range
the
soundstage
is
incredible
with
nice
detailing
as
wellworks
great
for
video
games
due
to
this
the
pads
on
these
headphones
are
also
pads
that
you
would
pay
at
least
50
dollars
for
and
are
very
qualityi
should
also
mention
though
that
these
pads
are
not
removable
have
also
had
no
issues
with
the
wood
cracking
so
to
me
it
just
looks
like
nice
addition
aesthetically
these
headphones
appear
bit
large
on
the
head
but
the
overall
design
is
quite
appealing
now
for
the
bad,
the
headband
on
these
headphones
is
poorly
designed
in
my
opinion
because
it
causes
large
amount
of
fatigue
on
the
head,
not
only
because
of
the
weight
but
also
due
to
slight
lack
of
support
on
the
headphone
band
of
these
headphones
the
other
main
issue
had
with
these
headphones
is
with
the
right
driver
constantly
cutting
out,
the
fix
is
extremely
simple
though,
you
just
need
to
get
another
cable
the
cable
that
comes
with
these
headphones
are
not
only
damage
to
the
right
connection
but
they
are
also
extremely
janky
and
overall
poor
quality
cable,
would
highly
suggest
getting
replacement
cable
had
purchased
the
neomusica
cable
for
the
hifiman
he400
but
the
connector
is
the
same
so
it
works
with
these
headphones
as
welli
was
extremely
satisfied
with
the
cable
overall
these
are
nice
pair
of
headphones
although
there
are
few
quirks
that
should
be
addressed,
in
my
opinion,
these
are
steal
at
the
price
point
comfort
'''4'''
only
because
they're
heavy
but
that
makes
them
sound
great
too
if
you're
looking
for
spacious
,
open
air
sound
you
found
it
voices
are
great
and
even
piano
sounds
good
only
thing
i've
heard
better
are
quad
electrostatics
if
you've
got
the
$
30,000
plus
i'd
like
to
add
like
almost
all
headphones
they
roll
off
in
the
high
end
,
so
edge
detail
is
lacking
so
i've
been
using
these
daily
for
almost
two
months
now,
and
there's
not
mucch
more
to
say
about
the
sound
and
comfort
besides
"wow"
these
headphones
are
amazinghowever
today
when
picked
them
up
to
put
on
as
usual,
one
headphone
just
snapped
off
the
plastic
piece
holding
it
on
just
gave
out
as
pulled
it
aside
to
fit
on
my
headi'm
hoping
some
super
glue
will
fix
the
problem
for
the
time
being,
but
that
giving
out
so
easily
is
huge
downside
i've
never
had
that
happen
before
even
with
cheap
headphones,
let
alone

burned
in
the
headphone
for
10
hours
or
so
before
serious
listeningthe
headphones
are
big
and
heavy
but
it
was
fairly
comfortable
with
the
big
ear
pads
and
the
little
cushions
on
the
headband
these
are
very
efficient
and
easy
to
drive,
which
understand
is
bit
unusual
for
planer
magnetics
certainly
more
efficient
than
my
beyerdynamic
t90's,
or
hifiman
he560's
also
planer
magnetic
and
least
efficient
of
all
my
cansi
would
describe
the
m1060's
sound
as
rich,
luxurious
and
full;
however,
the
treble
is
bit
recessed,
so
it
doesn't
have
as
much
air
and
treble
extension
and
resolution
as
my
t90's
or
he560
this
is
true
even
after
i've
eq'ed
the
m1060's
to
boost
the
base
and
treble
bit
as
far
as
soundstage
goes,
the
m1060's
is
wide
but
depth
is
fairly
shallow
again
my
t90's
and
he560's
have
greater
depth
giving
3d
effect
on
certain
recordings
where
the
m1060's
really
shine
are
on
poorly
recorded
cd's
never
bothered
listening
to
some
of
my
music
because
it
was
simply
unlistenable
with
the
t90's,
just
too
strident
but
sounded
great
with
the
m1060's
the
cult
love
cd
is
one
such
example
and
listened
to
it
for
the
first
time
in
long
time
and
just
got
lost
listening
to
the
music
the
strength
of
these
cans
are
great
bass
and
clear
mid's
it
has
enough
resolution
to
pick
out
individual
voices
in
multipart
harmonies
which
on
lesser
headphones
tend
to
bleed
together
as
single
voice
these
are
definitely
keepers
that
will
complement
my
other
headphonesbottom
line
if
you
are
looking
for
nonfatiguing,
smooth,
rich
sound,
the
m1060's
are
highly
recommended
if
you
are
looking
for
deeper
soundstage
or
something
with
more
treble
extension/resolution,
you
will
have
to
look
elsewhere
and
be
prepared
to
spend
bit
more
to
get
itupdate
october

2017:
my
right
ear
piece
lost
90%
of
the
sound
about
weeks
ago
hadn't
been
using
the
headphones
for
while
and
was
surprised
to
hear
that
problem
when
tried
them
again
contacted
monoprice
via
email
and
they
game
me
an
rma
with
shipping
labels
didn't
have
to
pay
shipping
the
total
process
took
about
weeks
and
just
received
brand
new
replacement
headset
give
kudos
to
monoprice
for
standing
behind
their
product
and
making
the
return
process
less
onerous
and
costly
especially
for
us
canadians
listened
to
the
new
headphone
last
night
and
they
sounded
greatupdate
march

these
sound
even
better
now
with
my
new

settings
and
thought
would
share
them
with
you
more
detail
and
texture
especially
in
the
vocals
and
treble
they
don't
sound
dark
with
these

looked

oh
my
gosh
this
is
great
headphone
all
the
reviews
you
read
online
about
this
being
comparable
to
more
expensive
models
are
probably
true
am
very
discerning
about
sound
microdynamics
is
what
changes
sound
to
music
it
is
in
the
microdynamics
of
sound
that
allows
you
to
hear
the
space
the
instruments
are
in
and
the
full
timbre
of
them
this
headphone
gives
that
modified
them
to
remove
the
foam
in
the
back
and
they
simply
improved
in
dynamics
and
treble
extension
vocals
seem
to
be
it's
strength
but
also
side
to
side
soundstage
is
very
strong
have
had
moments,
with
good
recordings
where
it
brings
me
to
an
emotional
point
in
the
beauty
of
the
song
and
the
soundfor
the
money
you
would
spend
on
better
headphones
buy
these,
do
the
mods
and
spend
the
money
on
music
and
support
artists
to
create
wonderful
things
these
bring
you
so
close
to
their
performance12/16/18
so
finally
was
able
to
put
in
the
hifiman
velour
earpads
that
are
recommended
for
this
headphone
it
completely
changes
the
dynamics
and
tone
of
the
headphone
these
are
different
and
far
better
headphones
one
of
the
complaints
about
the
1060
is
"darkness"
as
well
as
peak
at
about
3k
with
the
new
pads
easily
put
on
vocals
that
were
very
good
but
slightly
harsh
sounding
/
sibilant
are
completely
tamed
those
magical
microdynamics
increase
allowing
me
to
isolate
voices
that
are
double
tracked
or
spread
across
the
soundstage
bass
increases
and
is
distinct
as
an
instrument,
not
just
blob
of
low
sound
live
music
is
delightful
to
listen
to
with
this
headphoneexcept
for
the
velour
pads
at
2000,
all
of
the
modifcations
were
free
and
reversible
after
them
cannot
recommend
this
headphone
enough
the
detail
and
soundstage
as
well
as
smoothness
of
frequency
top
to
bottom
are
worth
far
more
than
the
cost
received
in
timely

they

instead
of

of
planar
headphones,
audeze

opportunity
pm3,
audioquest
nighthawk,
hifiman
he560
and
never
kept
any
of
them
think
that
have
never
found
set
that
had
the
sound
liked
at
price
commensurate
to
their
quality
and
which
would
want
to
spend
time
with
rather
than
with
my
sennheiser
hd800s
headphones
when
came
across
the
1060s
at
under
$300
couldn't
pass
up
the
chance
to
try
them
outfor
the
money,
they
are
beautifully
made
and
presented
out
of
the
box
they
didn't
sound
bad,
but
have
certainly
benefited
from
60
hour
burn
in
now
have
to
say
that
they
are
just
very
musical
set
of
phones,
warm
and
easy
to
listen
to
have
compared
them
to
the
hd800s
running
from
schiit
jotununheim
and
not
surprisingly
they
don't
compare
in
soundstage,
clarity,
high
end
accuracy,
but
at
the
price
that
isn't
what
am
looking
for
the
real
use
for
me
is
as
set
of
phones
to
casually
listen
to
music
from
my
fiio
x7
mkii,
and
for
this
they
are
great
they
are
comfortable,
bit
on
the
heavy
side,
but
not
to
the
point
where
noticed
it
the
pads
creaked
bit
when
first
used,
but
have
settled
down
and
are
plush
and
provide
good
comfortable
seal
have
no
complaints
about
the
cabling
which
is
really
thin,
but
seems
solid
enough
and
not
microphonic
with
the
new
25mm
at
the
headphone
end
and
35mm
for
the
player
connection,
this
is
an
easy
cable
to
replace
if
you
do
have
any
problemsas
far
as
the
sound
quality
goes,
they
have
reasonably
wide
sound
stage,
but
with
not
much
front
to
back
depth
bass
is
slightly
accentuated
and
top
end
rolls
off
bit
i've
seen
reviews
complaining
about
peak
at
5khz
and
other
problems,
but
don't
notice
it,
and
for
me
these
are
not
pair
of
reference
headphones,
they
are
something
to
listen
to
music
with
and
for
me
they
have
pleasing
musical
sound,
not
harsh,
not
super
sharp,
but
not
too
muddy
either
sound
you
can
just
sit
back
and
enjoy,
maybe
not
with
"wow"
but
with
long
term
smile
amazingly
some
people
who
don't
notice
the
5khz
problem
have
been
asking
for
advice
as
to
how
to
search
for
it
so
that
they
can
be
disturbed
by
it,
weirdthey
are
pretty
easy
to
drive,
certainly
from
the
x7
am3
stock
amp
module
did
buy
balanced
cable
on
amazon
and
tried
that
output
on
the
x7
to
the
m1060s
impossible
to
do
an
a/b
comparison
but
my
impression
was
that
the
balanced
gave
slightly
more
open
highs,
but
slightly
detracted
from
the
bass
and
didn't
help
the
warmth
so
have
sent
that
cable
back
and
happily
gone
back
to
the
supplied
se
cablein
conclusion
am
keeping
the
m1060s
for
relaxed
listening
when
want
to
listen
more
seriously
i'll
still
use
my
hd800ss
or
my
shure
se846s
for
the
fiio
x7
mkii
the
fact
the
can
listen
happily
to
the
m1060s
when
am
used
to
the
sound
from
totl
headphones
and
iems,
speaks
volumes
to
the
quality
of
the
m1060s
and
for
the
price
total
bargain
great
planar,
you
need
to
do
the
fuzzor
mod
to
eliminate
5k
ringing,
after
that
this
my
end
game,
also
tried
lcd22f,
it
is
no
match
to
this
m1060
is
more
conformable
470g
to
570g,
better
sound
stage
thanks
to
the
huge
and
deep
earpads
and
more
clarity
in
the
highs
you
do
need
to
eq
the
lows
abit
but
this
responds
to
eq
very
well
and
the
bass
will
extend
to
single
digits
tired
this
with
both
micca
origen
and
fiio
e10k
both
drives
this
fine
on
low
gain
so

they
feel
sturdy
and
look

currently

they
sounds

my
990dts
sounds
much

but
these
are

when
plugged

into

they
are
very
flat/muddy
so
far
sounds
stage
and
imaging
is
decent
and
the
bass
is
good
and
punchy
for
open
backs
bassier
than
the
990dts
but
so
far
thats
the
only
thing
they
do
"better"
am
taking
them
to
work
in
few
days
and
will
be
using
my

but
am
ultimatly
returning
wow
these
rock,
and
the
stylelove
them,
you
need
bit
of
power
to
drive
them
because
they
are
planar
magnets
instead
of
traditional
drivers
inside,
but
do
not
take
my
word
for
it,
even
though
think
anything
that
says
both
monoprice
and
monolith
are
the
deal,
your
mileage
may
vary,
but
am
betting
these
will
do
it
for
youget
good
amplifier,
they
will
not
reach
potential
out
of
an
ipod
or
phone,
but
out
of
an
amp,
with
the
size
and
shape
of
the
ear
cushions,
these
are
incredibly
easy
to
listen
to,
and
even
more
comfortable
drive
mine
out
of

suicide

100,
with
the

and,
wow
do
not
recommend
this
solution
for
everyone,
as
you
could
destroy
your
headphones,
and
kill
yourself,
by
pumping
50watts
per
channel
into
these,
or
hurt
yourself
permanently,
but,
wowi
am
listening
to
them
as
type
this,
on
that,
but,
seriously,
get
good
amp
purchased
these
based
on
the
seemingly
endless
praise
they
receive
on

forums
and
critics'
reviews
evidently,
monoprice

continuously
improved
these

feedback

specifically
was
claimed
sourpoint
on
the
first
runthey've
worked
to
improve
this
and
my
example
is
flawless
believe
this
itself
deserves
special
mention
company
that
genuinely
listens
to
its
customers
is
company
worth
supportingregarding
the
headphones
themselves:
it
is
common
for
people
to
compare
these
to
$700+
headphones
as
don't
believe
in
paying
that
much
for
pair
of
headphones,
can't
say
whether
or
not
it
is
reasonable
will
say
this,
though:
if
this
is
what
$700+
headphones
sound
like,
some
people
are
too
willing
to
be
ripped
off
these
are
not
exceptionalsounding
headphones,
even
at
their
pricerange
these
units
are
fairly
priced
at
around
$275
it's
good
not
amazing
sound
for
the
money
can't
accept
paying
any
more,
however
by
my
count,
nothing
that
most
reviewers
praised
are
truly
exemplary
clarity
is

sound
stage
is
good
but
not

best
for

and
people
love
to

that

are
amazing
for
bass
i've
heard
two
planar

including
this
and
have
not

found
that
to
be
the
case

not

grado
fashion,
impress
with
their
shimmering
and
incrediblydetailed
highs
the
monoprice
headphones
offer
neither
of
those:
they
lack
the
beautiful,
endless,
impactful
lowend
of
the
koss,
but
they
also
lack
the
wonderful,
shimmering
highs
and
bodaciously
intimate
mids
of
the
grados
therefore,
simply
don't
have
good
reason
to
want
to
listen
to
them
they're
not
especially
engagingone
other
thing
that
found
is
that,
particularly
compared
to
the
grados,
these
almost
exhibit
sound
like
listening
through
tube
there
is
some
resonant
quality
that
can't
quite
put
my
finger
on
that
is
absent
in
most
other
openback
headphones
that
i've
heard
it's
not
unbearable
and
your
ears
quickly
adjust
to
it
but
it
was
always
noticeable
after
listening
to
the
two
other
headsets
used
for
comparisondon't
get
me
wrong
these
are
good
sounding
headphones
but
manage
your
expectations
they're
appropriatelypriced,
but
these
aren't
the
endall
that
so
many
reviewers
seem
to
promiseregarding
other
aspects
of
the
headphones,
here
are
few
points:they
are
only
just
sensitive
to
be
powered
by
mobile
devices
they'll
barely
reach
loudenough
levels
for
some
people
to
enjoy
them
on
normal
smartphonesthese
are
large
headphones
they're
not
discrete
in
the
least
bit
you'll
acknowledge
this
right
when
you
see
the
box
in
which
they
arrive
they're
somewhat
heavy
not
to
the
point
of
ever
causing
me
fatigue;
but
if
you
lay
down,
you
may
find
that
they
want
to
slip
off
your
ears
comfort
is
great
the
pads
surround
large
ears
with
ease
and
the
deep
cutouts
ensure
that
your
ears
won't
touch
the
grills
temporal
pressure
is
just
right
and
the
headband
does
nice
job
distributing
weight
up
top
these
headphones
will
comfortably
accommodate
large
noggins
like
my
own
airflow
is
quite
good
for
leather/leatherette,
enabling
longer
listening
sessions
though
admittedly
haven't
worn
these
for
more
than
an
hour
at
time
build
quality
is
great
these
have
robust
feeling,
materials
are
attractive
and
impressive
cabling,
while
not
as
thick
as
you'd
probably
like
to
see
on
higherend
headphone,
still
feels
of
good
quality
and
is
of
no
concern
to
me
longevitywise
nice

at
both
endsnote:
most
of
my
impressions
were
formed
using
the
devices
use
most:
smartphone
moto
z,
laptop
alienware
15r3,
and
surface
pro
did
audition
with
higherpowered
sources
including
an
smsl
ad18
and
midrange
yamaha
hometheater
receiver
to
betterbutstillnotgroundbreaking
results;
but
because
it
is
very
rare
that
use
headphones
in
these
ways,
did
not
form
my
opinions
based
on
these
situations
my
personal
requirements
for
headphones
are
that
they
work
well
with
variety
of
sources
also,
in
no
circumstances
as
it
pertains
to
headphones
use
eq
adjustments
or
postprocessing
another
popular
claim
is
that
planar
headphones
respond
particularly
well
to
eq;
this
too
that
they're
any
better
than
dynamic
drivers
hold
skepticism
forbut
either
way,
it's
irrelevant
to
my
preferences
so
did
not
explore
this
claimalso,
while
don't
personally
have
stance
on
whether
or
not
burnin
is
tangible
phenomenon,
i've
listened
straight
out
of
the
box
as
well
as
after
letting
them
play
at
moderate
volume
for
48+
hours
enjoyed
them
more
after
the
"burn
in,"
but
acknowledge
the
possibility
of
placebo
mention
this
to
quell
the
notion
that
mine
simply
weren't
"broken
in"
gave
them
chanceultimately,
ended
up
thinking
this:
if
i'm
going
to
spend
$200+
headphones
for
home/portable
nonstudio
use,
it's
probably
better
if
they
offer
something
special
whether
it
be
bass
koss,
treble
grado,
noisecancellation
bose,
etc
these
planar
headphones
simply
don't
sound
special
enough
for
me
to
add
them
to
my
longterm
rotation
they're
definitely
not
bad
headphones
it's
just
that
you
can
find
more
exciting
sound
for
the
moneyquality:

should
go
without
saying
that
these
are
all
subjective
matters
some
people
are
bound
to
disagree,
and
fully
respect
that
these
are
merely
my
impressions
based
on
my
experiences
and
preferences
always
remember
to
form
your
own
here's
the
thing:
stock,
these
headphones
are
very
uncomfortable
to
me
for
long
listening
sessions
and
the
sound
is
close
but
not
quite
fantasticother
reviews
can
get
into
the
fantastic
sound
but
you
have
to
do
little
work
to
get
them
therebut
back
to
the
comfort
stock,
these
headphones
clamped
my
head
so
hard
that
the
rather
stiff
pads
would
crush
my
skull
to
the
point
that
after
an
hour
of
listening
i'd
have
to
take
them
off
because
the
area
around
my
ears
was
so
fatigued
but,
if
you've
done
any
research
on
these
headphones
at
all,
you'll
know
that
modding
them
is
what
takes
them
to
the
next
levelhere
is
list
of
mods
i've
done
to
make
them
my
favorite
headphones
out
of
all
of
the
ones
own
which
is
lot:fuzzor
mod
google
it
to
get
rid
of
the
5k
ringing
very
cheap
and
easy
mod
that
is
100%
worth
itear
pad
replacement
opted
to
go
for
the
brainwavz
microsuede
pads
and
they
are
soooooooo
comfortable
they
didn't
fix
the
fatigue
problem
on
the
headphones
for
me
but
they
did
make
it
lot
more
tolerable
the
pads
got
aren't
angled
and
some
might
argue
that
they
should
be
for
the
optimal
sound,
but
it
didn't
really
seem
to
affect
it
for
mei
bought
hifiman
he560
replacement
headband
on
some
random
website
called
adorama
for
$10
and
then
spraypainted
it
matte
black
and
then
replaced
the
stock
headband
with
this
it
both
improves
the
look
of
the
headphones
greatly
getting
rid
of
that
weird
boxy
look
and
made
them
thousand
times
more
comfortable
that
death
grip
on
the
sides
of
my
head
is
gone
and
now
can
listen
to
them
for
hours
straight
without
getting
fatigued
highly
recommend
doing
this
if
you
experience
the
discomfort
that
didlastly,
got
longer
cable
there's
nothing
wrong
with
the
stock
cable
other
than
it
is
really
short
and
find
that
annoying,
like
my
cables
to
be
somewhere
around
meters
long
oh,
and
the
connector
is
right
angle
which
makes
no
sense
but
that's
not
really
problemoverall,
love
these
headphones
with
all
of
my
heart
but
it
was
lot
of
work
to
get
them
to
that
level
they
sound
amazing,
they
look
super
premium
and
love
the
wood,
and
despite
all
the
necessary
modding,
at
least
are
extremely
easy
to
modwait
one
last
thing
the
ear
pads
are
glued
on
and
that
is
obnoxious,
but
once
you
have
your
better
replacements
on
there,
it
hardly
mattersedit:i
also
ended
up
taking
out
the
foam
and
replacing
it
with
very
thin
layer
of
spandex
directly
on
the
grill
and
it's
improved
the
sound
quite
bit
as
well
reviews
and
dms3
brought
me
to
this
purchase
they
were
spot
on
about
the
soundand
unfortunately
the
build
quality
everything
they
said
in
their
reviews
were
accurate
to
the
tee
if
you
can
get
past
the
uneasy
feeling
that
these
could
come
apart
anytime,
these
sound
way
better
than
any
headphones
i've
ever
tried
on
also
their
little
heavy
but
can
still
use
these
all
day
i'm
gamer
and
don't
know
if
these
are
the
"best"
for
gaming,
but
the
sound
stage
is
pretty
good
so
can
pinpoint
footsteps
very
easily
these
sound
so
good
though
that
just
prefer
to
have
music
playing
in
the
background
insteadbig
disclaimer:
they
need
to
be
broken
in
when
first
got
these
they
sounded
quite
bad
to
be
honest
after
leaving
them
to
play
music
for
while
though
they
sounded
quite
great
big
difference
after
leaving
them
for
about
hoursthis
the
point
of
view
of
an
enthusiast
i'm
no
audiophile
sounds
amazing
if
you
are
used
to
common/cheaper
headphones
these
will
feel
fairly
heavy
they
fit
amazingly
well
and
are
very
comfortable
in
all
other
aspectsthe
outer
grill/plate
thing
is
glued
on,
it
feels
like
it
could
get
pulled
off
if
it
got
caught
on
something
the
ear
muff
pads
also
seem
to
be
mostly
glued
in
place
and
are
not
user
replaceablethe
cable,
where
it
splits
to
is
delicate
after
just
couple
weeks,
one
ear
now
cuts
out
if
twisted
or
bent
just
wrong
at
that
split
tied
it
in
an
ugly
knot
and
it's
finei'm
generally
pretty
careful
with
my
stuff,
still
wear
the
same
oakleys
since
1998
for
instance
but
these
headphones
really
need
to
be
babied
to
prevent
issues
hello
all,to
start,
the
monoprice
monolith
headphones
are
great
set
of
cans
studio
recordings
are
incredibly
clear
and
have
sense
of
vibrancy
many
headphones
in
this
price
range
can't
dream
of
having
my
issue,
however
with
these
headphones
is
that
the
highs
are
tad
overdone
will
go
into
why
believe
this
to
be
the
case
and
hope
that
people
will
be
able
to
suggest
solutions
to
my
predicamentmy
listening
experience
is
strictly
orchestral
and
choral
recordings
studio
jazz
recordings
will
sometimes
find
way
into
my
library,
but
that
might
be
once
of
week
sort
of
thing
use
class
tube
state
amp
and
the
dragonfly
black
dac
both
amp
and
dac
realize
are
introductory
audiophile
instruments
but
served
me
fine
these
past
few
months
the
unique
issue
with
orchestral
and
choral
recordings
is
the
hall
or
cathedral/church
they
are
recorded
in
the
highs
in
these
spaces
soar
playing
predominant
role
in
the
soundstage
leaving
mids
and
bass
subdued
due
to
the
nature
of
these
environments,
recording
artists
attempt
to
compensate
for
the
blown
out
highs
in
the
room
and
even
mistakes
done
by
the
performers
it's
big
job,
and
they
have
lot
on
their
plate,
but
the
fault
perhaps
falls
on
the
technology
rather
than
the
spaces
and
performers
in
any
case,
my
recordings
still
have
sopranos
that
oversaturate
the
soundstage,
so
i'm
stuck
meddling
with
the
eq
and
purchasing
products
that
prioritize
warmth
over
anything
elsewhen
the
monoliths
are
concerned
purchased
them
under
the
assumption
that
they
would
provide
warm
soundstage,
but
was
wrong
the
sound
doesn't
envelope
the
area
as
much
as
would
have
wanted
which
is
disappointing
with
other
recordings,
these
cans
sound
phenomenal,
and
the
clarity
is
astounding,
but
having
such
unique
problem
with
such
niche
music
leads
me
to
search
for
additional
headphones
have
heard
that
changing
out
the
pads
might
help
with
the
warmth
so
might
attempt
to
do
that
in
the
future,
but
until
then
will
researching
other
sets
accordinglyi
hope
this
review
helpsps
if
you
are
wondering
what
music
to
gauge
how
high
the
highs
are
blown
out,
try
tenebrae's
recording
of
allegri's
"miserere
mei,
deus"
beautiful
piece
of
music
with
notorious
issue
of
blown
out
sopranos
if
you
don't
know
what
i'm
talking
about,
give
listen,
and
you
will
find
out
why
these
are
the
2nd
gen
lots
of
issues
fixedi'm
not
hardcore
audiophile
but
know
the
difference
between
terrible
headphones
and
great
headphones
these
are
mighty
good
for
the
price
are
they
perfect
no
but
for
the
price
they
are
better
than
perfect
open
headphones
with
planar
magnetic
drivers
rich
clean,
beautiful
no
complains
about
the
sound
of
course
if
you
are
noob
are
you
going
to
be
able
to
drive
these
with
your
your
phone
yes
and
no
can
you
hear
the
sound
yup
can
you
hear
the
music
to
the
fullest
and
experience
what
these
were
built
to
do
no
get
dac/amp
build
looks
odd
but
is
comfortable
my
only
complaint
is
they
get
little
wonky
sometimes
when
you
take
them
off
the
ears
rotate
too
much
causing
you
to
get
minature
puzzle
included
with
them
when
are
attempting
to
put
them
up
aside
from
that
everything
else
is
fantastic
snagged
these
used
here
on
amazon
for
way
lower
than
expected
was
worried
that
they'd
come
in
poor
condition
or
heavily
worn,
but
the
only
issue
was
cracked
wooden
ring
on
one
side
it's
blemish,
but
this
is
known
issue
in
these
believe
mine
are
the
v2
ones,
because
the
detachable
cable
uses
25mm
ts
connectors
anyways,
they
sound
great,
and
they
sound
better
now
that
i've
modded
them
to
have
more
open
external
grills
and
internal
fazors
really
though,
that
boosted
up
the
quality
maybe
10%20%
and
they're
already
the
best
headphones
i've
ever
owned
beware
though;
these
headphones
got
me
obsessed
with
music
in
way
haven't
been
in
the
last
10
years
the
build
quality
doesn't
scream
"luxury
headphones"
or
anything,
and
the
headband
is
pretty
cheap,
but
on
the
whole
the
use
of
metal
and
wood
for
the
cans
themselves
makes
it
feel
about
right
for
its
price
are
there
better
headphones
yes
can
you
beat
the
value
for
pair
of
planar
dynamic
headphones
if
you
catch
them
at
good
price
can't
say
for
sure,
but
think
you'd
be
hardpressedoh,
also,
soundquality
wise
if
you're
major
basshead,
this
is
probably
not
for
you
the
bass
is
robust
and
clear
but
it
doesn't
feel
like
it's
exerting
pressure
on
your
eardrums
it
doesn't
have
bass
that
you
**feel**
if
that
makes
sense
but
it'll
bring
out
other
details
in
the
music
that
you
never
knew
were
there,
and
the
soundstage
is
nice
and
wide94/10,
would
recommend
received
the
item
in
box
that
had
clearly
been
opened
the
other
products
had
ordered
and
the
larger
amazon
box
were
fine
so
it
was
clearly
shipped
this
way
after
inspecting
to
make
sure
the
wood
was
not
cracked
plugged
them
in
to
little
dot
ii
for
listen
was
happy
with

case
been
using
the
headphones
unmodded
for
around
week
now
using
it
with
magni
+
modi
and
i'm
very
satisfied
with
the
sound
when
it
works,
praising
the
same
points
already
listed
from
reviews
before
me
although
i'm
highly
considering
doing
the
fuzzor
mod
as
the
5k
ringing
was
lot
more
annoying
than
predicted
it
to
beunfortunately
got
bad
cable
i've
had
to
spin
it
at
certain
degree
and
also
tape
the
cable
near
the
connecter
at
an
angle
to
get
the
sound
to
work,
which
even
then
will
sometimes
not
work
because
the
35mm
doesn't
quite
connect
properly
to
the
1/4th
adapter,
even
though
hear
it
snap
into
place
lately
i've
had
to
put
pressure
on
the
35mm
into
the
1/4th
to
get
it
to
work
at
this
point
i'm
questioning
if
i'm
actually
hearing
what
the
headphones
are
supposed
to
sound
like
or
if
i'm
not
hearing
its
actual
sound
it's
frustrating
but
i'm
gonna
have
to
buy
custom
cable
if
even
decide
to
keep
thesei
would've
liked
to
given
this
45
but
welp,
got
unlucky
received
the
m1060
on
august
20th
and
use
the
headphones
for
month
already
use
it
with
tube
amplifier
nobsound
ms10d
purchased
this
amplifier
because
did
not
like
my
sennheiser
hd800s
headphones
on
any
solid
state
amps
the
m1060
sound
good
with
solid
state
amps
and
with
the
tube
amp
also,
could
not
tell
much
noticeable
difference
use
with
tube
amp
my
sennheiser
hd800s
with
classical
music
and
soundtracks
only,and
for
that
type
of
music
the
best
ever
heard
for
other
type
of
music
use
sennheiser
hd600
and
other
headphones
all
of
them
have
dynamic
drivers
purchased
the
m1060
headphones
for
movies
but
tested
in
month
with
music
also
my
main
purpose
of
purchase
because
did
not
have
headphones
for
movies
and
did
not
have
planar
magnetic
headphones
until
now
did
not
want
to
spend
800
dollars
for
lcd2
classic
until
heard
planar
magnetic
headphone
read
many
opinions
about
the
m1060
and
after
all
decided
give
try
built
quality
yes
flimsy
and
have
to
handle
with
care
handle
with
care
all
my
headphones
anyway
so
that
is
okay
with
me
use
all
my
headphones
at
home
and
of
them
closed
back
,
but
the
others
are
open
back
headphones
the
m1060
very
comfortable
on
my
head
and
many
times
used
for
more
than
hours
watching
movies
did
not
make
any
modifications
on
my
m1060
but
changed
the
cables
because
did
not
like
the
elbow
shape
35mm
jack
connector
at
all
that
is
the
only
thing
changed
was
curious
how
the
treble
sound
on
the
m1060
because
never
tested
planar
magnetic
headphone
before
read
many
people
make
modifications
on
these
headphones
and
seen
it
on
youtube
also
won't
make
any
because
like
how
it
is
don't
hear
any
5k
ringing,
probably
that
issue
was
fixed
this
is
the
2nd
generation
m1060
what
have
in
movies
when
people
taking
don't
hear
harsh
and
sh
sounds
at
all
,
the
highs
are
just
right
the
treble
is
very
good
and
don't
need
more
mid
range
is
good
like
it
and
the
bass
go
deep
but
the
amount
of
the
bass
for
me
not
enough
so
had
to
turn
the
bass
on
my
amplifier
+4db
for
my
liking
at
0db
for
me
the
amount
of
bass
not
enough
am
so
glad
the
m1060
takes
the
+4db
bass
very
well
with
the
4db
plus
enjoy
the
movies
and
the
bass
does
not
leak
in
the
mid
range
at
all
the
m1060
is
50ohm
96db
sensitivity
headphone
on
my
amplifier
not
as
loud
as
the
300
ohm
104db
sensitivity
sennheiser
hd800s
or
the
sennheiser
hd600
what
also
300
ohm
both
300
ohm
sennheiser
headphones
sound
louder
on
my
amp
than
the
50ohm
m1060
turn
on
the
volume
when
use
the
m1060,no
problem
don't
know
other
planar
magnetic
headphones
would
need
+4db
bass
for
my
taste
or
not
but
love
the
m1060
on
+4db
bass
increase
if
would
listen
music
and
wound
not
use
the
m1060
for
movies
only
,
would
turn
the
bass
on
+2db
only
my
sennheiser
hd800s
and
hd600
don't
need
the
+4db
bass
but
with
movies
absolutely
love
the
m1060
with
the
+4db
bass
after
month
test
decided
to
keep
the
m1060
and
think
for
280
dollars
very
good
might
get
later
on
the
audeze
lcd2
classic
for
movies
not
sure
yet
if
order
the
lcd2
in
the
future
and
won't
like
it
better,
will
return
the
lcd2
after
test
it
and
stay
with
the
m1060
almost
forgot
the
sound
stage
of
the
m1060
wide
enough
for
me,
but
does
not
come
close
to
the
sennheiser
hd800s
with
tube
amplifier
hd800s
listening
classical
music
and
soundtracks
never
heard
any
other
headphones
would
be
as
wide
the
m1060
enough
wide
for
movies
my
opinion
i've
had
these
for
few
months
now,
and
can
say
they
are
the
best
sound
you
can
get
at
this
price
pointif
you're
new
to
planar
magnetic,
these
are
an
excellent
introduction
to
pm
soundbuild
quailty:
excellent
the
frame
is
all
metal,
the
earpads
are
very
soft
leatherish
comfort:
top
notch
what
sets
these
apart
in
terms
of
comfort
is
their
adjustability
they
have
degrees
of
rotation,
so
much
so
that
you
can
completely
invert
the
drivers
can
wear
these
for
hours
with
no
discomfort,
you
don't
notice
them
after
whilesound:
very
good
impedance
is
pretty
low,
so
you
can
drive
these
with
phone
bass
response
is
relatively
good
for
pm;
you
won't
get
that
over
reaching
punchyness
that
you
can
from
regular
dynamic
drivers
as
with
other
pm
i've
listened
to,
the
outstanding
clarity
and
real
detail
these
effortlessly
produce
is
amazing
after
listening
to
my
first
pair
of
pm
the
massdrop
hifiman
he4xx
knew
couldn't
go
back
to
dynamic
and
frankly,
actually
just
listened
to
pair
of
electrostats,
and
honestly,
law
of
diminishing
returns
is
in
full
effect
i'd
stick
with
these,
as
they
are
worth
every
penny,
where
with
the
more
expense
headphones,
you
start
to
wonder
what
more
you're
getting
for
your
money
answer,
not
muchnow,
to
be
fair,
these
are
not
my
go
to
cans
when
want
to
an
unadulterated
sonic
experience:
that
leave
to
the
hifiman
sundara
but
as
stated
in
that
review,
those
are
pretty
uncomfortable,
and
when
will
be
listening
for
more
than
short
while,
use
these
monolith
cans
9/10
would
recommend
right
out
of
the
box
the
m1060
don
sound
great
although
the
headphone
has
glorious
imaging
and
sound
staging,
as
well
as
powerful
and
good
bass
response,
the
mid
range
is
too
congested
and
the
treble
is
too
shrill
sounding
which
makes
for
very
fatiguing
listening
experience
but
the
good
news
is
the
m1060
have
potential
and
there
is
simple
and
costeffective
cure
for
those
on
budget
by
way
of
using
small
strips
of
selfadhesive
felt
on
all
sides
inside
the
ear
pads
this
helps
balance
out
the
mids
to
large
degree
and
gets
rid
of
most
of
the
ringing
around
45
khz
also
removed
the
thick
foam
from
the
outer
ear
cups
which
further
improved
clarity
and
sound
stageif
money
is
no
issue,
the
headphone
can
be
further
improved
with
eikon
pads
from
zf
have
not
tested
the
audeze
vegan
pads
that
others
have
been
using
but
cannot
imagine
they
sound
better
than
the
eikons
there
is
no
need
for
the
selfadhesive
tape
method
with
the
zf
pads
the
icing
on
the
cake
to
further
reduce
ringing
are
3d
printed
phasors
over
the
transducers
with
these
mods
the
m1060
does
sound
fantastic
especially
for
old
music
like
jazz
and
bluesin
addition,
find
the
cable
that
comes
with
the
headphone
unacceptable
the
cable
connectors
failed
and
caused
my
cavalli
amp
to
go
into
safety
mode
due
to
an
apparent
short
so
be
prepared
having
to
spend
even
more
money
on
upgrading
the
cable
or
simply
replace
the
cable
connectors
as
the
cable
actually
does
sound
goodout
of
the
box
give
the
m1060
stars,
stars
with
the
simple
mod,
and
stars
with
new
pads
and
phasor
modi
do
like
the
m1060
with
the
mods
they
do
have
character
and
now
sound
like
much
more
expensive
planar
headphones
had
to
change
to
headphones
while
my
main
room
with
higher
end
sound
equipment
was
getting
new
carpet,
new
paint,
etc
bought
these
headphones
because
they
resembled
the
eltrostatic
qualities
of
my
high
end
system
at
first,
was
using
some
other
well
known
brand
of
headphones
bought
few
years
ago
once
got
these,
they
sounded
much
better
once
broken
in,
they
sound
even
more
better
am
running
these
these
relatively
higher
end
dac/headphone
amp
from
my
computer,
just
to
be
clear
am
very
happy
with
these,
the
sound
quality
it
greati
did
upgrade
to
the
braided
cable
after
50
hrs
of
breakin,
they
sound
betterthe
other
reviewers
are
correct,
they
are
little
flimsy,
but
am
gentle
with
them
just
as
am
with
all
of
my
equipment
these
really
deliver
on
sound
this
very
fun
sound
great
for
the
price
but
the
newer
1060c
sounds
significantly
better
after
you
remove
the
wood
to
make
them
open
headphone
the
biggest
upgrade
is
the
base
its
so
good
and
detailed
and
louder
with
out
sacrificing
the
midst
and
treble,
the
midsts
are
almost
as
good
as
the
senheiser
650
also
it
is
the
easiest
to
drive
for
the
level
of
sound
unlike
senheiser
you
need
decent
little
amp
currently
my
favorite
pair
is
m1060c
open
and
senheiser
58x
that
one
is
bargain
for
what
you
get
$130
with
discount
on
massdrop
previously
owen
audeze
lcd
it
is
to
me
almost
the
perfect
headphone
its
like
ducati
1299
fast
sexy
adrenaline
always
at
100
and
the
other
two
like
harley
davison
its
less
of
everything
but
they
are
more
comfortable
and
more
fun
for
longer
rides,
returned
the
audeze
most
of
the
time
used
the
senheiser
and
$1000
for
the
audeze
wich
verily
used
it
wasn
worth
at
the
moment
the
other
two
are
good
enough
for
the
moment
not
pleasent

got
refundtime
from
amazon
delivery
to
my
doorstep
from
me
filing
an
rma
for
return
<30minsthere
is
reason
why
these
are
are
priced
the
way
they
are
they
obviously
skipped
on
quality
these
cans
were
an
impulse
buy
like
the
sound
of
planar
speakers
so
thought
would
like
planar
headphones
too
was
not
disappointed
with
these
they
sound
incredible,
especially
for
$300
better
than
most
"studio"
quality
cans
that
i've
used
throughout
my
career
these
are
not
for
critical
listening
imho
because
they
do
color
the
sound
gently
and
are
little
bright
but
the
soundstaging
and
resolution
are
great
they
are
my
new
goto
pair
for
in
the
office
power
needs
are
modest
i've
driven
them
with
everything
from
an
ssl
console
down
to
the
new
pioneer
dap
santa
brought
me
and
they
haven't
overwhelmed
anything
yet
they
are
comfy
albeit
heavy
must
have
second
or
later
generation
set
because
don't
hear
any
5k
ringing
that
others
have
mentioned
and
the
build
quality
is
great
recommended
when
first
got
these,
was
hyped
but
little
worried
they
fit
comfortably
but,
they're
waaaay
too
heavy
mean,
you
look
down
for
split
second
and
they
eject
clean
off
your
head
now,
the
huuuge
problem
had
noticed
until
too
late,
that
apparently,
the
25mm
plug
that
was
plugged
into
the
left
can
had
actually
cracked
this
lead
to,
overtime,
the
plug
corroding
and
weakening
the
metal
so,
when
adjusted
the
plug
due
to
audio
cutting
out
on
my
left
side,
it
snapped
clean
out,
leaving
the
broken
plug
lodged
inside
the
can
exceptionally
let
down
would
definitely
not
ever
recommend
these
to
literally
anyone
don't
make
my
same
mistake
and
in
case
you
do
buy/own
these
already,
make
sure
if
you
buy
replacement
cable
to
actually
buy
the
right
size
saw
people
answering
questions
saying
the
plugs
for
the
headphones
were
actually
35mm,
but
in
reality
they
are
25mm
mine
came
open
box
and
cord
were
missing
not
big
deal
since
amazon's
return/replacement
policy
is
very
goodsound
is
just
amazing,
my
daily
drivers
are
fostex
th900
and
haven't
felt
that
m1060s
were
missing
somethingbut
weight
is
500gr,
too
much
monoprice
technology
is
awesome,
only
wish
monoprice
develops
something
similar
to
drop
desing
on
hifiman
series
or
mrspeakers
aeon
and
under
400gr
with
similar
sound
to
1060
if
that
ever
happens
this
will
top
selling
hpstill
stars
for
sound
i've
now
had
these
m1060's
for
about
years
now
and
haven't
had
any
problems
with
them
despite
the
rough
design
the
sound
is
worth
way
more
than
the
actual
build,
though
got
the
"fixed"
version
of
them
they
still
don't
exactly
ooze
quality
its
mainly
the
headband
ive
got
problem
with,
but
again
for
the
price
its
more
than
worth
it
for
the
sound
the
only
things
i've
done
to
mine
is
take
off
the
back
plate
and
removed
the
foam
behind
oh,
and
i've
also
switched
out
the
stock
pads
with
dekoni
hybrids
if
could
somehow
get
the
audeze
head
band
put
on
these
things
they
would
be
perfect
for
me
the
stock
headband
is
literally
the
only
things
that's
skimped
out
on
when
it
comes
to
the
quality
and
comfort
of
this
headphone
and
that's
not
really
enough
to
stop
these
from
being
comfortable
these
are
great
headphones,
enough
said
bought
these
few
months
ago
before
this,
don't
think
i'd
ever
even
tried
on
pair
of
headphones
that
cost
more
than
$100,
so
i'm
definitely
not
an
audiophile
who
can
write
poignant
review
of
the
technical
merits
of
these
headphones,
but
am
music
fiend,
and
wanted
to
get
pair
of
headphones
that
would
allow
me
to
hear
every
level
of
detail
to
my
favorite
tunes
turns
out
these
were
the
right
buy
these
headphones
arent
perfect
for
me,
but
i'll
take
pair
of
headphones
that
straightforwardly
invest
in
the
parts
that
matter
rather
than
branding
and
hype
any
day
i'll
just
review
the
construction
for
the
average
nonaudiophile
like
methe
construction
is
pretty
solid,
"tested"
read:
abused
them
pretty
well
to
find
out
they
have
few
weak
points,
but
nothing
that
cant
be
addressed
with
some
proper
care
and
caution
first,
dont
put
any
more
stress
on
the
r/l
cord
inputs
than
is
necessary
to
plug/unplug
them,
or
the
wood
will
crack
at
this
location
second,
the
main
metal
headband
connects
with
the
semicircular
metal
bands
of
each
earphone
via
nut
and
bolt,
which
are
beautifully
covered
by
some
machined
aluminum
caps
these
caps
are
not
fixed
in
place
with
adhesive,
nor
are
the
nuts
locked
into
position
with
any
adhesive
think
they
are
lock
nuts,
but
in
my
testing
abusing
of
the
headphones
construction,
they
each
in
time
worked
themselves
loose,
popped
off
their
aluminum
caps,
and
eventually
the
nuts
themselves
popped
off
not
to
worry,
they
are
standard
size
m25
locknuts
are
what
you
want
to
replace
them
with
should
you
also
feel
the
need
to
abuse
your
headphones
to
the
point
of
losing
them,
which
can
be
found
here
on
amazon
for
small
priceanother
note
on
the
construction:
because
these
headphones
use
formed
metal
headband,
it
acts
as
spring
and
contorts
the
headphones
into
one
of
maybe
two
or
three
positions
some
youtuber
really
bemoaned
this
point
but
its
really
no
big
deal
just
turn
the
phones
to
face
each
other,
and
with
simple
screwcap
type
twisting
motion,
they'll
return
to
normal
position
and
be
ready
to
slide
on
your
headfinally,
you
may
want
to
replace
the
cord
while
its
nice
and
long
long
enough
for
six
foot
me
to
do
silly
things
like
set
my
phone
on
the
ground
while
do
yoga
with
ridiculously
massive
headphones
on,
after
raveling
and
unraveling
it
so
many
times,
it
eventually
got
so
kinked
as
to
be
tangled
100%
of
the
timeif
this
is
the
only
review
you
read,
then
you
will
miss
few
other
key
points
of
these
headphones,
which
are
that
they
can
be
modded
in
many
ways
to
cover
any
of
the
sound
artifacts
that
serious
audiophiles
which
you
may
turn
into
after
getting
these
dislike
as
well,
they
can
be
fitted
with
different
earcups
if
you
dont
mind
ripping
off
the
ones
already
on
there
and
adhering
new
ones
on
know
depend
on
these
reviews
to
help
my
buying
decisions,
so
like
to
offer
my
review
of
the
outstanding
monolith
m1060
after
trying
several
different
headphones,
and
coming
away
disappointed
with
the
headphonesy
sound;
boxy,
lacking
real
soundstage,
gave
the
monoliths
shot
my
oh
my
am
glad
did
the
detail,
expansiveness
of
the
soundstage,
and
comfort
of
them
is
ridiculous
at
this
price
very
very
highly
recommended
these
cans
sound
incredible
they
appear
to
be
little
ragged
in
their
construction
at
first,
but
after
wearing
them
for
good
twenty
hours,
they
are
well
constructed
the
weight
is
no
problem
very
comfortable
own
headphones
costing
34
times
what
these
cost
and
the
m1060s
give
them
all
run
for
their
money
love
the
planar
technology
simply
amazing
quality
you
can
hear
god
with
these
these
headphones
will
get
you
the
best
bang
for
your
buck
and
compete
on
level
playing
field
with
>1000$
headphones
don't
know,
sound
experience
and
musical
enjoyment
is
very
subjective
listened
to
bunch
of
headphones
and
liked
these
the
best
maybe
you
will,
tooi
like
the
aesthetics
of
the
metal
and
wood
wouldn't
say
they're
flimsy,
but
the
metal
is
thin
and
the
articulated
ear
cups
allow
them
to
get
twisted
around
if
you're
not
careful
i'm
assuming
if
you're
buying
big,
expensive
headphones
you're
going
to
be
careful
with
them
be
warned
if
you
have
more
rugged
use
in
mind,
but
for
laying
back
in
big
leather
chair,
sipping
favored
beverage
and
listening
to
music,
they're
pretty
great
the
sound
quality
is
amazing,
but
only
as
good
as
your
source
these
headphones
are
brutal
and
unforgiving
if
using
low
quality
dac
and
amp
use
little
dot
1+
vacuum
tube
amp
with
assorted
dacs
depending
the
cups
are
deep
and
thick,
very
comfortable
to
wear
for
several
hours
of
listening
this
is
great
addition
to
my
headphone
collection
the
headphone
simply
sounds
worse
than
other
300
dollar
offerings,
the
midrange
is
really
lackluster,
and
the
treble
is
completely
crazy,
there's
very
weird
ringing
in
5k
as
well
which
there's
nothing
you
can
do
about,
the
bass
is
nice
and
well
extended,
especially
for
an
open
back
headphone,
but
it
cannot
save
the
rest
of
the
headphone
i've
seen
few
good
reviews
of
these
headphones
and
was
curious
to
hear
planar
magnetics
so
bought
pair
compared
to
my
akg
k712
pro's
and
sennheiser
hd
650's
these
m1060's
did
not
impress
me
at
all
about
the
only
thing
it
beat
them
in
was
soundstage
when
playing
games,
although
it
was
almost
unnaturally
wide
mids
feel
bit
too
recessed,
and
oddly
there
was
less
bass
than
both
the
k712's
and
hd
650's
strange,
because
the
bass
is
one
of
the
aspects
that
most
of
the
reviews
praised
it
for
for
anyone
wondering
what
setup
tested
these
on,
tried
schiit
magni
3/modi
multibit
stack,
micca
origen
g2
and
my
denon
x1300w's
headphone
jack
i've
seen
all
sorts
of
mods
that
supposedly
"fix"
these
headphones
but
i'm
not
willing
to
waste
more
time
or
money
on
thembuild
quality
seems
decent
the
ear
pads
are
very
comfortable
but
the
headband
would
get
painful
after
about
30
minutes
it's
annoying
how
the
cups
are
freely
spin
around
the
braided
cable
looks
nice
but
it's
way
too
shortfor
some
reason
the
clamshell
case
arrived
with
mold
all
over
it
from
searching
around
on
google
this
seems
to
be
common
issue
was
about
to
buy
sennheisers
hd650
when
came
across
those
decided
to
give
them
try
and
i'm
happy
with
my
purchase
bought
brainwavz
xl
micro
suede
pads
for
these
and
did
the
fuzzor
mod
bought
better
cable
as
well
stock
was
little
dark
and
echoey,
but
with
the
mods,
treble
and
mids
sound
better,
no
more
echo,
and
this
headphone
is
real
winner
i've
owned
dt880's,
dt990's,
hd600's,
hd598's,
msr7's,
shp9500's,
sr850's,
and
now
these
these
are
by
far
my
favorite
man
man,
do
these
ground
you
if
you
dont
have
good
source
of
audio,
its
the
kind
of
headphone
that
brings
all
the
audio
and
put
as
it
is,
cant
say
for
now
that
they
are
great
because
for
now
im
running
them
whit
phone:,
shame
but
they
do
still
sound
pretty
good,
cant
imagine
how
great
they
will
sound
when
get
my
dap,
be
sure
to
have
solid
soyrce
of
audio
if
not,
dont
bother
im
being
100
%
honest,
they
will
show
you
how
shit
youre
phone
or
computer
sound
is
haha
after
owning
these
weeks,
paired
with
their
upgraded
cord
and
fiio
q1
mark
2,
these
things
rockthey
are
well
broken
in
and
sound
great
waiting
on
pair
of
balanced
cables
to
really
make
the
dac/amp
power
them
got
them
for
200
used
put
them
against
my
only
other
headphones
t20rp
from
fostex
returned
the
fostex
m1060s
are
amazing
in
comparison
not
much
experience
otherwise
yet
looking
at
the
1570s
like
many
bought
these
because
of
zeos
if
you
don't
know
who
he
is,
he
is
well
respected
member
of
the
audiophile
community
that
reviews
headphones
if
you
have
doubts
just
google
search
"zeos
m1060",
he'd
probably
answer
all
of
your
questions
in
that
video
or
any
of
his
comments
just
bear
in
mind
the
version
of
the
m1060
he
reviews
are
the
other
ones,
there
has
been
quality
upgrade
in
the
current
revision
of
the
m1060now
as
for
my
cents,
300
bucks
might
seem
like
lot
specially
for
headphones
that
are
not
beats
or
bose
or
any
actual
major
headphone
brand
for
that
matter
let
me
tell
you
this,
the
moment
you
put
them
on
you
do
not
feel
$300
worth
in
your
head
you
feel
superb
comfort
with
those
huge
pads,
clear
flat
sound
that
easily
responds
to
eq
changes
if
you
wish
to
tweak
them
to
your
music
preference,
and
most
importantly
planar
thingsif
you
don't
know
what
i'm
talking
about
planar
headphones
are
more
modern
approach
to
the
headphone
design,
i'll
spare
you
the
details
but
the
jist
of
it
is
this:
if
you've
only
had
dynamic
headphones
normal/mainstream
headphones
this
headphone
will
be
completely
different
to
anything
that
you've
ever
heard
guarantee
itto
sum
things
up,
these
headphones
are
pretty
good,
there
are
better
ones
but
for
the
price
you
cant
beat
these
comparing
these
to
my
other
highend
headphones,
the
now
discontinued
denon
ahd5000,
these
resolve
more
detail,
have
larger
soundstage,
and
better
separation
can't
say
that
they
have
"better"
imaging
just
"different"
imaging
do
get
more
realistic
sense
that
music
is
in
the
room
with
me
than
with
the
denons,
so
it
might
very
well
be
better
they
don't
have
the
bass
extension,
lushness,
or
fun
factor
of
the
ahd5000,
but
you
do
get
sense
that
they're
technically
"superior"
headphones,
whatever
that
means
these
days
then
again,
that's
why
lot
of
us
have
multiple
headphonesi
did
find
that
they're
much
more
sensitive
to
input
sources
than
the
denons,
which
themselves
sound
good
enough
on
just
about
everything
never
felt
the
need
to
enable
any
tube
emulation
features,
or
bass
boosters,
or
anything
like
that
however,
on
these,
adding
tube
emulators
and
effects
seems
to
improve
the
sound
which
is
good,
because
they
sound
bit
on
the
thin
side
without
any
adjustmentsi
didn't
notice
any
of
the
ringing
or
eq
issues
that
i'd
read
about,
so
either
they're
not
there,
or
just
can't
hear
them
will
say
that
you
probably
do
need
to
do
some
eq
adjustments,
because
they
sound
bit
thin
at
default
settingsoverall,
great
value
for
the
price
these
headphones
have
great
sound
but
the
quality
of
the
build
was
disappointment
to
me
everything
about
the
ear
pieces
were
way
to
loose
for
my
likings
am
worried
about
the
longevity
of
the
cable
and
the
apparent
proneness
to
scuffs
but
the
m1060
is
very
comfortable
and
sounds
amazing
put
my
hd
6xx
to
shame,
though
don't
have
particularly
impressive
amp/dac
to
drive
them
these
sound
great
regardless
of
source
so
far,
it's
hard
to
complain
about
any

great,
with

and
good

negative
is
the
weight:
the

soft

comfortable,

after

you
can
really
feel
the
weight
in

500
gramsthese
are
my
first
planar
magnetic
headphones
and
overall
they
seem
to
be
doing
very
good
job,
delivering
high
fidelity
sound
without
emphasizing
on
particular
tonality
absolutely
bloody
amazing
for
how
much
they
are,
with
good
amp
they
are
fantastic
don't
like
the
twisty
headband
but
great
sounding
headphone
recommend
from
an
audiophile
me
bought
these
as
gift
for
my
son
after
much
research
he
picked
them
out
for
himself
and
he
loves
them
they
sound
great,
and
find
them
very
easy
to
listen
to
the
only
problem
for
me
is
that
they
do
get
very
uncomfortable
if
you
have
them
on
for
an
extended
period
of
time
the
headband
digs
into
my
head
after
while
almost
to
the
point
of
being
painful

was
happy
until

have
not

buy
these
am
alittle
bit
crazy

just
bit
more
but
for
95%
of
people
there
is
more
than
enoughbuild
is
ok
not
amazing
but
good
just
you
have
to
treat
them
like
vintage

constantly
checking
to
see
if
everything
is
in
it's
right
place
personally
for
me
this
has
been
constantly
tightening
down
the
swivel
for
the
right
cup
to
the

they
switched
the
inputs
on
the
headphones
to
25mm

for

junkies
wanting
to
have
fun
listening
to
their
music
i've
mulled
over
purchasing
pair
of
the
m1060's
for
couple
of
months
now,
reading
through
all
of
the
reviews
and
complaints,
as
well
as
praises
i'll
start
by
saying,
it
is
true
that
these
are
giant
slayers,
in
my
opinion
much
better
than
the
audeze
lcd2's
and
they
battle
fairly
well
with
the
lcdx's
from
my
limited
experience
of
borrowing
those
headphones,
that
isas
for
the
usual
review,
let's
start
with
the
build
qualitythey're
"eh"
they're
very
comfortable,
that
is
no
issue
at
all,
but
the
actual
structure
is
lacking
have
the
second
revision,
so
they
fixed
some
issues;
25mm
jacks
instead
of
mmcx
connectors,
rounded
down
the
sharp
edges
on
the
backplate,
fixed
the
headband
clips
so
the
headband
wouldn't
fall
out,
gave
6ft
cable
instead
of
4ft,
and
treated
the
wood
on
the
inside
so
it's
less
likely
to
splinter
but
the
metals
and
plastics
are
thin,
they
have
an
incredible
amount
of
flexibility
and
because
of
this
but
also
feel
as
though
they
could
swing
off
if
turn
my
head
to
the
side
quick
enough
and
unfortunately,
you
cannot
easily
replace
the
pads
as
they
are
glued
on
not
an
issue
for
me,
they're
actually
very
comfortable
pads
finding
the
l/r
speakers
can
be
little
annoying
for
some,
to
help
out
i'll
say
the
pads
are
slanted
and
the
fatter
side
goes
to
the
back
of
your
earsthe
styling
is
well
nice
nothing
too
bad,
you'd
look
bit
like
douche
to
rock
these
in
public,
but
they're
very
simple
the
wood
ring
surrounding
the
drivers
is
real
wood,
and
the
backplate
is
metal
styling
isn't
really
forte
for
these
headphones,
but
who
gives
s@#%
these
aren't
here
to
make
you
look
cool,
they're
made
to
extend
your
joy
of
music,
and
that
is
what
will
talk
aboutnow
the
sound
this
is
why
i'm
able
to
look
past
any
issues
i've
mentioned
above
this
is
why
i've
given
starsthe
sound
is;
phenomenal,
absolutely
beautiful,
pure
sexthey
are
warm
and
vibrant,
plenty
of
low
end
to
be
comfortable
without
being
overbearing,
highs
tad
rolled
off,
but
that
only
enhances
the
warmth
in
my
opinion
the
mids
are
real,
they
are
there
and
they
want
to
be
noticed,
they
play
excellently
with
acoustics,
drums,
and
voices
the
soundstage,
due
to
the
open
back
design,
is
wide
and
open,
sound
seperation
is
brilliant
and
everything
is
finished
with
beautiful
clarity
and
imaging
they
have
punchiness
to
them
that
just
works,
and
really
makes
drums
and
thumps
come
alivei
am
currently
listening
to
nils
frahm's
"all
melody"
album
in
flac,
with
the
ifi
black
label
dac/amp,
and
music
like
this
sparkles,
really
is
wonderful,
though
that's
not
to
say
they
are
amiss
from
any
other
genre
listen
to
everything;
folk,
metal,
ambient,
jazz,
you
name
it,
and
it
works
with
everythingi've
heard
people
speak
of
the
5k
ringing,
this
isn't
something
i've
noticed
don't
know
if
it's
fixed
with
the
revision,
or
if
it's
just
luck
of
the
draw,
or
if
it's
just
going
deafif
you
value
critical
listening
and
enjoying
your
music
to
the
fullest,
these
are
must
have
these
headphones
are
truly
awesome
the
headband
material
and
yoke
is
questionable,
but
if
you
handle
carefully
and
take
care
of
these
guys
they
are
definite
need
if
you
want
to
try
planar
magnetic
headphones
loving
this
so
far
my
thing
has
5khz
ringing
too
already
own
the
hifiman
he650
planar
magnetic
cans
$899
so
i'm
familiar
with
what
good
headphones
sound
like
wanted
to
get
second
pair
for
use
at
work
with
shiit
fulla2
dac,
so
thought
i'd
give
these
try
to
save
moneyshort
review
they're
*amazing*
highly
recommended
longer
review
these
headphones
are
delight
to
listen
to
crystalclear
highs,
deep
resonant
bass
the
included
carrying
case
is
appreciated
and
of
good
quality
they
are
comfortable
and
lightweight
to
wear
the
only
minor
issue
if
the
earpads
leave
my
ears
little
hot
with
extended
wearing,
but
this
is
worth
it
for
the
sound
and
the
sound
is
good,
*really*
good
can't
tell
much
of
difference
between
these
and
the
hifiman
phones,
which
cost
significantly
moreif
you
like
good
sound,
you
deserve
to
treat
yourself
with
these
great
headphone
well
balanced
sound
signature
with
good
bass
no
defects
on
mine
would
recommend
this
planar
planar

its
great
since
package
arrive
i've
found
crack
on
woodring
cs
can't
help
anything
for
this
problem
it
feeling
bad
for
me
vary
good
headphone
these
headphones
are
something
else
was
watching
the
new
netflix
cloverfield
movie
with
these
things
on
and
might
as
well
been
sitting
in
movie
theater
every
explosion,
door
slam,
bump,
scream
made
me
jump
by
how
accurate
and
loud
it
sounded
originally
bought
these
for
gaming
and
already
have
nice
522
system
set
up
with
onkyo
txnr656
dolby
atmos
receiver
but
now
also
use
these
for
listening
to
music
and
movies
/
shows
extremely
pleased
with
these
headphones
and
highly
recommend
them
perfect
as
expected
but
don't
wait
for
good
built
quality
worked
good
enough
while
had
them
cable
went
out
within
couple
of
weeks,
and
as
there
are
no
replacement
cables
that
aren't
an
arm
and
leg
had
to
return
the
whole
set
back
just
to
get
new
cable
it
was
then
lost
in
the
mail
if
you're
rough
on
cables
don't
go
for
this
unless
you
have
cash
to
burn
awesome
headphones
for
the
money
had
qc
issues
with
mine
sound
better
than
than
hd650s,
x1's,
x2's
only
issue
is
the
headband
is
slightly
uncomfortable
after
wearing
for
while
was
searching
for
the
right
headphone
and
didn
want
to
spend
too
much
after
going
through
several
headphones
decided
on
this
one
not
audiophile
but
to
my
ears
these
sounded
way
better
than
my
hd650
in
every
way
wished
could
have
bought
it
earlier
excellent
sounding
planar
headphones
comfortable
with
good
adjustment
sound
is
accurate
with
large
soundstage
sound
quality
versus
price
is
outstanding
these
headphones
are
wonderful
but
have
larger
than
normal
head
and
as
consequence
the
headband
applies
the
entire
weight
of
the
headphones
to
one
point
on
the
top
of
my
head
for
me
this
caused
mild
headaches
after
about
half
an
hour
of
use
tried
using
extra
padding
to
alleviate
this
issue
but
it
didn't
help
the
headphones
themselves
sound
amazing,
but
wish
the
headband
distributed
the
weight
of
the
headphones
across
the
head
more
evenly
received
this
product
today
as
soon
as
pulled
the
plastic
wrapping
off
the
box
found
the
contents
to
be
covered
in
mold,
mean
everything
while
contacting
amazon
to
conduct
return
started
to
look
little
deeper
into
reviews
for
this
product
noticed
that
many
reviewers
stated
the
poor
qc
from
monolith
and
it
got
me
wondering
who
builds
300
headphone
and
doesn't
even
bother
to
add
the
silica
gel
packets
found
in
nearly
every
product
on
the
planet
once
saw
the
mold
and
noticed
the
missing
silica
packs
didn't
even
want
to
bother
with
the
exchange
amazon
was
processing
called
them
back
deleted
the
order
and
went
with
the
hifiman
sundara
for
bit
more
amazon
did
good
job
with
the
customer
service,
no
issues
there
keep
in
mind,
the
m1060's
have
been
around
for
bit
now
with
somewhat
good
reviews
regarding
the
sound
just
believe
you
can
also
get
good
hardware
to
go
with
good
sound
when
paying
these
prices
in
the
back
of
my
mind
truly
regret
not
even
being
able
to
hear
them
but
as
gump
said
"stupid
is
as
stupid
does",
and
would
be
fool
to
have
kept
these
after
the
ones
opened
and
the
reviews
read
never
buying
monolith
again
until
see
improved
reviews
concerning
their
quality
control
maybe
they
sound
great,
will
never
know
but
i'm
not
in
the
market
to
spend
cash
for
something
that
will
not
last
these
are
simply
fantastic
don't
bother
with
the
sub$1,000
hifimans
or
any
of
the
sennheisers
up
to
maybe
the
hd700s
get
these
soooooo
comfortable
some
of
the
most
comfortable
i've
ever
tried,
including
the
sony
mdrxb700s
with
their
pillowpads
they're
significantly
heavier
than
those
but
that's
because
their
planars
can't
think
of
another
headphone
that's
comparable
in
quality
within
$500
people
have
complaints
about
the
build
quality
but
didn't
have
them
long
enough
to
see
them
bought
and
returned
these
only
because
was
comparing
them
to
my
audeze
lcd2s
and
honestly,
question
that
decision
every
time
see
them
love
the
design
as
well
you'll
definitely
want
good
amp,
though
just
wanna
say
love
these
head
phonesthey
seem
little
fragile
but
doesn't
matter
to
me
because
take
extreme
care
of
my
stuffthey
are
very
comfortable
as
well
to
me
will
write
headphone
review
here
both
burn
in
48
hours
before
use
themboth
from
monoprice,
m560
and
m1060m1060:
a+
sound
not
as
good
as
thx00
nor
hd600,
but
for
the
price
of
planar
headphone,
have
to
give
a+,
design
and
build
quality
only
wear
it
twice
and
the
leather
head
band
broke
from
metal
bracketm560
:
a+
design
and
build
quality,
sound
vocal
ok,
but
you
can
forget
about
the
bass
on
this
headphone
even
you
turn
the
volume
up
all
you
get
is
distortion
soundi
mean,
come
on,
monoprice,
reallyis
it
really
so
hard
to
use
the
m560
design
on
m1060
then
we
can
have
wonderful,
great,
perfect
headphoneplease
give
us
m1060
mkii,
please
great
product
for
the
value
set
and
most
likely
will
take
the
300600
market
as
the
king
these
things
sound
amazing
for
$300
headphoneswhich
makes
sense
since
they
are
very
close
the
lcd2s
but
at
fraction
of
the
cost
besides
the
few
issues
with
qc
which
imo
are
understandable
in
company
new
to
the
headphone
space
this
is
looking
to
be
very
promising
lineupupdate:i
ended
up
returning
them
for
refund
sadly
one
of
the
issues
that
plague
these
is
the
headband
straps
mechanism
for
keeping
it
attached
to
the
metal
frame
is
very
poorly
designed
and
keeps
slipping
out
escaped
the
wood
cracking
issues
and
they
sound
amazing,
but
will
be
waiting
for
the
next
batch
that
fixes
their
design
flaws
and
quality
control
problems
still
recommend
people
trying
them
out
at
least,
they
can
always
be
returned,
but
damn
do
they
sound
good
just
perfect
very
comfortable
ear
pads
the
sound
is
wonderful
it's
not
new
productfell
for
iti
can't
reach
you
my
pair
were
ringing
in
the
45khz
region,
unbearable
it
wasn't
apparent
on
some
tracks
but
clear
as
day
on
others
returned
immediately,
no
idea
if
it
is
qc
issue
or
just
the
sound
of
the
cans
very
underwhelming
out
of
the
box
would
have
liked
to
know
what
they
sound
like
after
decent
breaking
in
period,
but
the
second
time
used
them
one
of
the
channels
went
dead
it
wasn't
the
cable,
as
swapped
the
channels
and
the
same
earpiece
was
dead
then
plugged
in
another
set
of
headphones
and
they
worked
fine
then
took
the
m1060s
and
tried
them
on
another
dap,
same
problem
contacted
amazon
and
they're
going
back
guess
you
do
get
what
you
pay
for
great
sound,
cheap
construction
they
felt
very
fragile
the
ear
pads
are
also
glued
on
