work
dream
on
my
ps5
controllergood
quality
and
long
lasting,
have
owned
few
pairs
of
kontrol
freeks
throughout
the
years,
simply
pop
on
with
minimal
effort
and
the
extra
comfort,
grip
and
surface
area
really
helps
purchased
these
after
using
the
galaxy
thumb
sticks
for
while
way
better
reach
and
less
fatigue
have
custom
aim
controller
which
found
had
slightly
longer
joysticks
than
normal
ps4
these
are
perfect
swapped
over
to
the
alphas
after
using
the
cqc
freeks
the
lower
rise
for
me
feels
so
much
better
over
the
mid
rise
cqc
freeks
they
have
definitely
improved
my
accuracy
btw
mainly
use
these
to
play
battlefield
my
thumb
used
to
slip
lot
specially
playing
fifa
but
now
it
improved
so
much,
would
recommend
for
sport
and
shooting
games
great
just
what
you
need
to
improve
your
aim
on
ps4
after
few
months
the
kontrol
greek
turns
black
in
middle
gets
dirty
though
easily
also
there
gripyness
runs
out
after
week
pros:+protect
ps4
thumbsticks+provide
extra
grip;
better
than
the
default
ps4
thumbsticks+comfier/more
enjoyable
experience
for
long
sessions
of
gamingcons:they
aren't
as
durable
only
last
around
months
before
the
rubber
becomes
ungluedas
result,
price
is
little
steep
than
what
it
could
be,
but
still
solid
value
compared
to
having
to
buy
new
controller
from
the
thumbsticksi
love
the
alphas
as
they
aren't
much
taller
than
the
default
ps4
thumbstick
and
protect
the
rubber
on
the
actual
controller
thumbsticks,
which
tend
to
deteriorate
after
frequent
use
they're
little
more
grippy
and
add
some
colour/flair
to
your
controllers
on
top
of
protecting
the
actual
thumbsticks,
which
is
greati
frequently
play
games
using
controller
mainly
sport
games/rocket
league,
which
means
that
am
constantly
using
the
thumbsticks
while
playing
set
up
with
the
alpha
on
the
left
stick
and
classic
on
the
right
stick
as
it's
what
find
the
comfiest
and
perform
the
best
withthe
only
negative
thing
have
to
say
about
the
alphas
is,
for
their
price,
they
could
be
little
more
durable
unlike
the
classic
freeks,
the
alphas
have
very
limited
lifespan
due
to
their
rubber
falling
off
after
wear
and
tear
i've
gone
through
pairs
of
the
alphas
in
years,
which
is
quite
lot
considering
i'm
still
on
the
original
classic
that
i've
had
since
2016
and
they
aren't
showing
any
signs
of
wear
outside
of
falling
off
occasionallyoverall,
the
alphas
are
very
good
for
protecting
your
thumbsticks
without
having
the
massive
height
like
their
other
thumbsticks
do
i'd
recommend
them
if
you
aren't
fan
of
the
ps4
thumbsticks/need
little
more
grip,
but
on
the
note
that
you'll
likely
be
ordering
them
every
year
because
it's
hard
to
play
without
them
hello,
this
is
my
second
time
purchasing
your
grip
for
the
ps4
controller
and
this
time
around
the
grip
has
separated
from
the
adhesive
already
in
the
first
week
of
receiving
them
competitive
gamer
with
an
active
steaming
party
of
20120
viewers
at
time
and
regularly
recommend
your
products
to
viewers
feel
ve
been
given
defective
unit
and
would
appreciate
if
it
could
be
replaced
as
it
is
affecting
my
gameplay
drastically
can
provide
pictures
if
necessary
of
said
flaw
and
the
purchase/date
that
ve
received
your
product
if
needed,
or
will
choose
to
look
elsewhere
for
my
gaming
needs
thanks
for
your
timechris
at

gamingchris
the
ds4
that
came
with
my
ps4
has
an
analog
stick
that
is
badly
peeling
thought
i'd
fix
it
by
buying
this
and
clipping
it
on
however,
it
didn't
work
well
it's
not
bad
product
but
it
just
slides
off
too
easily
to
be
usable
even
off
of
the
analog
stick
that
is
good
also,
it
rubs
against
the
ds4
good
concept,
poor
application
despite
it
saying
that
it's
"handmade
in
the
usa",
$22
is
just
way
too
much
for
two
pieces
of
tiny
plastic
and
rubber
ive
been
using
kontrolfreek
thumb
grips
for
probably
years
or
so
now
cant
use
ps4
controller
without
them
they
make
long
gaming
sessions
manageable
these
out
of
the
many
ive
used
are
nice
for
the
non
fps
games
like
fifa
and
ark
survival
perfect
mainly
got
these
because
the
regular
ps4
controller
thumbsticks
felt
so
weird
to
me
and
these
word
so
well
thoses
are
the
only
ones
that
order
for
the
ps4
and
they
last
awhile
bought
many
before
work
great
last
long
enoughthis
time
ended
up
with
defective
one
kontrolfreek
non
sono
niente
male
molto
comodi
resistenti
great
product
don
know
how
gamed
without
them
only
compliant
is
they
last
maybe
year
or
so
they
rubber
can
fall
off
would
be
great
if
they
didn
spin
on
the
sticks
have
small
hands
female
and
tend
to
use
the
edges
of
the
sticks
lotcan
remedy
with
some
ticky
tack,
but
shouldn
have
to
great
product
will
purchase
again
aaa++++
they
are
great
and
improvement
over
the
stock
thumb
pads
and
sticks,
only
thing
is
when
your
hands
get
sweaty
the
pads
still
slike
arround
actually
helped
by
giving
me
wider
thumbsticks
going
back
to
the
normal
thumbsticks
is
near
impossible
lol
dislike
don't
work
with
my
setup
uncomfortable
really
enjoying
my
kf
tumbsticks
good
grip
and
it
really
helps
getting
better
with
high
sensitivity
recommend
:dd
my
aim
is
so
much
better
thanks
to
these
no
good
don
stay
on
keep
falling
off
cant
play
without
them
mest
buy
exactly
what
we
expected
good
fit
&
feel
product
is
fine,
paid
extra
for
shipping
and
arrived
day
late
love
kontrol
freek
decent
all
round
love
the
low
concave
this
product
for
my
left
joystick
and
mid
rise
convex
for
my
right
joystick
they
used
to
have
specific
green
pack
for
this
but
it
currently
not
available
feel
like
the
low
concave
on
the
left
helps
you
more
with
the
movement
as
opposed
to
convex
raised
up
have
used
these
for
years
and
will
continue
to
play
lot
of
rocket
league
on
pc
and
i've
started
using
ps4
controller
like
the
controller
lot,
but
the
thumbsticks
are
little
small
for
my
hands,
and
they
always
felt
tad
on
the
stiff
side,
got
these
in
the
mail
and
threw
on
on
the
left
thumbstick
and
what
difference
it
makes
the
grip
is
wide
and
tacky
and
my
thumb
sits
in
it
perfectly
given
the
amount
of
long
traveling
stick
movements
that
need
to
be
performed
quickly,
was
nervous
that
too
much
added
height
on
the
stick
would
be
disruptive,
but
the
alphas
minimal
height
was
perfect
the
slight
added
torque
you
get
on
the
stick
makes
the
movement
that
used
to
feel
stiff
now
feel
as
smooth
as
my
xbox
elite
controller
did
if
you
are
looking
for
better
grip
on
your
sticks
but
don't
want
added
height
for
fps
aiming,
get
these
good
stick
cover
for
the
left
stick
shooters,
rpgs,
most
action/
combat
games
wider
area
than
standard
ps4
stick
and
good
pattern
to
help
your
thumb
keep
grip
minimal
height
difference
put
these
on
now
before
your
standard
sticks
start
shedding
rubber
like
mine
product
does
not
stay
on
thumbstick
durring
game
play
am
constantly
pausing
to
fix
my
thumbsticks
that
are
coming
off
have
now
removed
them
and
dont
plan
kn
using
them
again
waste
of
money
simple
rubber
grip
that
fits
over
the
thumb
would
work
this
design
is
extremely
flawed
don't
like
this
product
whatsoever
big
waste
of
$17
dollars
was
excited
when
they
came
in
just
when
started
gaming
they
would
fly
off
in
order
for
these
to
work
as
they
should
they
would
need
to
be
super
glued
to
the
joysticks
never
again
will
purchase
this
brand
also
lost
one
of
them
while
was
gaming
and
still
cant
find
it
total
junk
im
just
gonna
pony
up
and
get
new
controller
while
love
these
thumbsticks
they
don't
stay
on
well
especially
when
you
need
them
your
getting
shot
and
you
try
to
move
quickly
and
the
thing
pops
offas
they
are
to
me
they
are
worth
about
$5
for
$15
expect
them
to
stay
on
it
grips
your
thumb
great
thumb
sticks
no
issue
with
my
hands
slipping
off
the
analog
stick
enjoy
the
increased
size
and
slight
raise
of
the
alpha
joystick
boosters
wish
they
connected
little
more
securely
they
have
tendency
to
fall
off,
if
you
get
too
excited
with
the
sticks
bought
these
for
fps
games
r6,
cod
but
they
didn't
really
help
at
all
if
anything,
they
made
my
movement
sloppy
and
imprecise
feel
these
are
better
for
racing
games
or
slow
pace
games
have
tried
multiple
thumb
grips
and
these
by
far
are
the
best
and
provide
the
best
grip
while
play
fps
like
ww2
and
battlefield
good
quality
was
able
to
increase
my
sensitivity
and
accuracy,
definitely
takes
some
getting
used
to
falls
off
controller
after
few
weeks
having
these
makes
world
of
difference
in
comfort
for
me
while
game
also
can
tell
difference
in
my
movements
and
aiming,
as
they
seem
to
be
more
crisp
as
described
bought
these
for
my
16
year
old
son
he
said
they
don
stay
in
place
and
weren
worth
the
money
nice
quality,
helps
your
game
if
you
put
in
the
effort
and
get
use
to
them
think
they
should
be
cheaper
for
what
they
are
but
still
glad
purchased
them
big
time
help
much
better
than
stock
joystick
company
makes
great
products
good
grips
among
the
line
of
the
rest
they
fit
perfectly
and
are
great
ad
on
to
my
controller
solid
from
the
moment
put
them
on
same
as
the
black
they
make
my
fingers
feel
so
great
these
are
fantastic
they
give
the
perfect
amount
of
rise
off
the
analog
sticks
for
increased
sensitivity,
the
rubber
is
very
grippy
and
my
thumbs
dont
slip
and
they
have
yet
to
come
off
during
game
play,
unlike
other
brands
have
triedyou'd
be
surprised
how
much
small
tweak
to
your
controller
like
this
can
increase
your
accuracy
in
fps
games
found
these
to
be
bit
too
tall
for
my
liking
the
quality
is
good
overall
absolutely
love
it
very
comfortable
and
worth
the
buy
over
hyped
