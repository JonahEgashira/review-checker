do
like
these
for
surehowever
find
that
for
some
reason
they
pop
off
too
regularly
which
is
quite
annoyingpreviously
had
used
quite
large
concave
style
thumbsticks
for
few
years
but
found
was
bending
the
top
of
my
left
thumb
too
hard
so
look
for
change
was
recommended
these
which
are
so
much
betteronly
grievance
is
the
looseness
of
the
the
fitting
these
things
really
do
improve
accuracy,
more
so
on
fps
first
person
shooter
games
have
used
for
years
and
these
are
the
best
yet
give
them
time
to
wear
in
as
the
design
was
hurting
my
thumbs
at
first
but
after
week
or
so
of
using
the
rubber
wore
down
and
became
soft
used
for
many
months
now
and
no
issues
brought
there's
on
amazon
think
they
great
you
can
use
or
just
one
depends
hoe
you
play
games
seems
to
make
the
controler
easy
very
pleased
with
theses
easy
goes
on
the
pad
fantastic
quality
ordered
them
to
improve
my
analog
aim
they
are
decent
but
they
are
hard
to
get
used
to
bought
sets
if
these
for
my
foster
boys
they
love
them,i've
never
played
on
ps0
but
apparently
makes
gaming
better
i'll
have
to
take
their
word
for
it
great
item
my
son
loved
it
im
still
crap
but
that's
down
to
me
pretty
useful
for
the
real
gamers
though
glad
bought
this
when
did
it
limited
edition
and
my
son
was
very
happy
to
get
it
for
xmas
the
thing
about
this
product
is
that
it
is
good
if
you
don
want
to
spend
lot
of
money,
my
aim
improved
more
with
this
item
really
helpful
great
good
for
accuracy
have
one
on
r0
and
the
other
spare
as
it
not
necessary
for
me
to
have
on
l0
as
well
never
the
less
this
has
definitely
enhanced
my
gaming
experience
as
described
great
addition
to
gaming
setup
arrived
on
time,product
as
described
and
exactly
what
we
expected
quick
and
easy
to
set
up,
good
value
for
the
money
really
good
so
much
easier
for
fps
game
amazing
product,
great
for

highly
recommend
non
ho
molto
da
dire,
sono
considerazioni
personali,
io
mi
ci
sono
trovato
malissimo

restituiti
,ho
preferito
adattare
gli
analogici

questi
marchingegni
infernali
tutto
perfetto
volevo
ringraziare
amazon
ed
il
corriere,
erroneamente
ho
detto
che
la
consegna
è
andata
male
invece
quando
sono
tornata
casa
ho
trovato
il
pacco
perfettamente
disposto
davanti
alla

internamente
al

ordered
sets
of
different

thumbsticks
and
only
the
fortnite
ones
have
issues
inferno
and
galaxy
purple
are
great
products
but
these
fortnite
ones
do
not
stay
on,
they
pop
off
with
the
slightest
pressure
will
be
sending
these
ones
back
and
ordering
different
set
as
these
are
no
where
near
the
quality
of
the
other
kontrol
freek
sets
have
my
son
bought
these
for
his
ps0
controller
and
says
they
re
great
they
add
control
and
accuracy
to
your
playing

am

ko**t
mich
mein
malträtierter

an

feels
great,
but
not
ideal
for
scuff
vantage
fits
the
small
standard
scuff
stick,
but
must
be
removed
every
time
in
order
to
swap
out
other
stick
or
dpad
it
fits,
but
isn
an
ideal
fit
you
really
have
to
force
it
on
this
isn
something
you
will
want
to
do
lot
of
otherwise,
you
will
have
to
replace
the
stick
in
general,
it
gives
you
more
space
to
move
your
thumb,
so
it
is
easier
to
hit
your
targets
i'm
playing

brthe
product
is

it

it
is

haven't
tried

it
may

gives
you
extra
movement
due
to
the
longer
stick
and
therefore
pivot
on
the
stick
keeps
my
thumbs
from
hitting
each
other
as
play
on
the
ps0
controller
which
is
real
problem
for
me
this
alone
makes
these

for
me
now
definitely
purchase
these

on

my

loves
them
he
was
very
excited
to
unwrap
this
gift
for
his
birthday
they
showed
up
quickly,
and
are
exactly
as
described
great
quality
lil
rough
with
my
playing
so
once
in
while
the
right
one
will
pop
off
witch
is
horrible
mid
game
but
it
not
that
often
and
probably
gonna
glue
it
on
so
very
good
quality
product
really
makes
difference
when
playing
mmo
rpg
or
shooting
games,
much

wish

ordered
these
because
can
use
my
scuff
with
ps0
fit
perfectly
and
stay
in
place
my
only
complaint
is
the
texture,
would
prefer
just
plain
smooth
domed
instead
of
the
odd
textured
graphics
el
material
en

es
bueno

el

well
on

and
0,
not
sure
if
it

can't

going

they
work

very
useful
but
oddly
enough
only
like
it
on
the
right
joystick
very
helpful
little
tool
for
subpar
gamers
like
myself
these
sticks
definitely
help
me
play
little
better
by
not
allowing
every
twitch
of
my
thumbs
to
throw
my
crosshairs
across
the
screen
very
well
made,
easy
to
install,
and
effective
highly
recommend
it'll
take
lil
bit
to
get
used
to
butfrom
what
understand
these
should
reduce
thumb
fatigue&
increase
range
of
motion&
the
grip
is
excellent
they
fall
off
alllll
the
time
if
you
play
anything
like
me
and
jump
lot
or
use
lot
of
motion
they
will
be
flying
off
left
and
right
it
completely
messed
up
the
stock
grip
on
my
controller
analog
stick
the
kontrol
freeks
were
pretty
sharp
so
when
put
it
on,
it
instantly
stabbed
into
the
thumbstick
adds
height
to
sticks
so
you
can
make
much
smaller
adjustments
for
finer
control
use
them
primarily
for
war
thunder
and
they
do
improve
the
control
needed
for
realistic
air
battles
have
ordered
different
versions
of
these
in
the
past
these
new
ones
are
by
far
my
favorite
definitely
worth
getting
if
you
play
shooter
games
these
are
great
for
any
one
who
plays
fps
was
very
impressed
at
how
much
it
helped
my
game
playing
ability
would
recommend
them
to
anyone
who
plays
regularly
works
the
way
they
say
it
does
much
better
than
the
cheapo
silicon
generic
brandi
thought
the
kontrol
freak
was
expensive,
until
saw
the
competition
easy
removal
and
application
to
thumbsticks
one
week
in
and
hands
feel
better,
when
grinding
awaythe
generic
silicone
wrapping
ones
bought
thinking
would
work
fell
off
and
were
not
easy
to
put
on
correctly
they
re
too
small
to
fit
the
ps0
controller
you
can
fit
them,
but
they
mangle
the
joysticks
and
that
not
what
you
want
maybe
just
got
bad
batch,
but
disappointed
already
threw
them
out
and
didn
bother
returning
them,
which
should
have
done
bought
these
because
had
pair
of
performance
sticks
from
another
company
but
they
came
off
way
too
easily
and
cause
me
to
throw
some
gamesthe
kontrolfreak
fps
battle
royals
sticks
stay
firmly
attached
even
when
react
quickly
and
push
them
forcefully
midgame
also
love
the
grip
on
the
thumb
stick
great
product
however
will
say
that
it
is
weird
fit
on
the
astro
c0
the
stick
extension
increases
your
range
of
motion
on
joystick
which
makes
it
easier
to
control
the
speed
of
your
aim
with
practice,
it
becomes
much
easier
to
perform
the
micro
adjustments
needed
to
track
or
hit
headshots
son
loves
it,
he
said
recommend
to
anyone
great
range
of
motion
and
feels
comfortable
starts
awsome
came
super
fast
and
love
the
way
they
feel
great
product
looks
awesome
on
the
controller
and
they
work
great
highly
recommend
these
are
great,
easy
added
height
for
accuracy
as
youd
expect
but
more
importantly
my
fingers
don't
slide
off
them
all
the
time
like
other
brands
or
styles,
the
added
textures
make
huge
difference
for
sure
definitely
get
them
if
you're
looking
like
putting
one
on
my
left
joy
stick
to
help
with
movement
mobility
especially
with
first
person
shootermultiplayer
games
like
call
of
duty
and
battlefield
didn
not
like
the
little
nubs
on
the
top
they
felt
weird
to
me
to
move
around
with
so
would
suggest
getting
different
ones
if
people
really
want
these
also
they
popped
of
my
sticks
all
the
time
so
would
not
recommend
these
don't
fit
the
ps0
thumb
sticks
very
well,
they're
slightly
small,
and
when
hard
gaming
and
pressing
hard,
in
direction,
they
will
pop
off
pretty
easily
if
you're
looking
for
extensions
for
ps0,
these
might
not
be
for
you
pops
off
semi
regularly
on
the
left
stick,
never
the
right
stick
thoughwould
recommend
the
inferno
ones
over
these,
they
don
fall
off
this
is
my
second
pair
they
by
far
my
favorite
sticks
from
kontrolfreek
overall
very
good
product
sometimes
it
falls
off,
but
usually
works
well
decent
cool
works
well
with
ps0
controllers
recommended
with
the
kontrol
freak
aim
assist
pads
helps
with
over
compensation
and
allows
you
to
turn
the
sensitivity
all
the
way
up
very
nice
grips
but
fit
was
loose
and
grips
hang
on
to
joysticks
but
rotate
while
on
had
ordered
this
product
couple
days
ago
but
different
color
