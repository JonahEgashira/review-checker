the
packaging
is
more
useful
than
the
headphones
at
least
was
able
to
recycle
that.terrible
product,
hard
to
believe
sony
would
put
their
name
on
this.the
cord
is
super
long.
the
sound
is
truly
terrible.i'd
return
it
if
didn't
already
throw
it
away
i've
never
had
better
mono
earphones!!!
just
the
brand
name
alone
sony
made
me
happy
when
opened
my
package
because
it
is
such
well-known
name.
the
audio
is
perfect--way
beyond
the
previous
mono
earphones
i've
had
over
the
years.
i'd
recommend
them
highly
to
anyone
who
is
looking
for
really,
really
good
mono
earphone.
rarely
use
"regular"
earphones
because
i've
been
recovering
from
the
bad
fall
had
in
february
of
2015
and
have
to
spend
lot
of
time
resting
in
bed.
although
have
regular
earphones
they
aren't
appropriate
if
person
is
bed-ridden.
can
lay
comfortably
in
bed
mostly
on
my
right
side
to
watch
my
tv
so
mono
earphone
is
what
needed
and
i'm
proud
to
say
have
the
best
of
them
all.
thank
you,
amazon!!!
if
you
have
lost
your
hearing
in
one
ear
you
may
have
already
encountered
some
of
the
challenges
when
listening
to
stereo
audio
through
head
phones.
for
few
years
threw
money
at
all-in-one
stereo-to-mono
earbuds:
brite
buds,
short
buds,
1-bud,
and
the
like.
these
all-in-one
solutions
worked
but
found
the
quality
to
be
poor,
and
the
cords
too
short,
and
the
prices
relatively
high.
the
hard
plastic
housing
the
speaker,
and
the
hard
plastic
tube
that
mounts
the
rubber
ear
fitting
would
frequently
break
apart.
the
short
cords
meant
that
when
moving
around
something
stationary
like
laptop
an
extension
was
required
or
else
the
earbuds
would
occasionally
be
pulled
from
my
ear
as
moved,
sometimes
even
damaging
the
female
jack.after
having
gone
through
about
dozen
poor
quality
all-in-one
stereo-to-mono
earbuds
over
the
years
think
ve
finaly
hit
upon
winning
combination:
this
product
the
sony
me-83
mono
earphones
code
3m
me83
+
monoprice
107160
3.5mm
stereo
plug
to
3.5mm
mono
jack
adaptor
.
you
need
the
adaptor
since
the
sony
me-83
mono
earphone
is
only
mono-to-mono
connection.
if
you
plug
it
straight
into
stereo
jack
you
will
only
get
one
audio
feed
the
left
one
iirc,
but
together
with
the
adapter
it
great
combination.
the
ear
piece
is
well
constructed
and
quite
comfortable.
the
meter
cable
is
great,
short
of
getting
up
and
walking
away
there
little
chance
of
yanking
on
the
cable.
that
said
it
does
require
some
cable
management
if
you
are
frequently
moving
your
equipment.
best
of
all
this
mono
ear
piece
and
the
adapter
together
cost
about
third
the
list
price
for
most
of
the
all-in-one
stereo-to-mono
earbuds.tldr:-can
only
hear
in
one
ear.-most
all-in-one
stereo-
to-mono
earbuds
are
garbage-now
use
this
product
with
3.5mm
mono
jack
adaptor
this
is
pretty
good
earphone
..the
sound
is
good
and
this
make
me
very
happy
!!
thanks
!!the
second
order
arrived
almost
10
days
earlier.
good
!!
great
sound!
this
is
quality
earfone,
and
with
really
long
cord,
which
you
can
always
roll
up
if
you
don't
need
the
length.
the
main
thing
dislike
about
it,
the
wire
is
way
too
damn
long!
it's
nice
to
have
some
lenght,
but
that
is
an
extreme...
apart
from
that,
the
sound
is
bit
off
but
it
works
and
the
earplug
is
not
creating
discomfort
in
the
ear.
works
well.
has
long
cord.
very
satisfied.
ordered
more.
good
quality.
like
the3
meter
cord.
good
price.
qualité
sonore
quelconque.
fil
trop
long.
cord
is
too
long
item
shipped
as
advertised.
it
does
have
super
long
cable
as
in
more
than
6',
which
works
well
for
routing
discretely
through
clothing.
ear
bud
is
very
comfortable
for
my
ear,
single
mono
bud
has
very
good
audio
for
what
it
is.
but
there
us
huge
minus:
the
jack
sticks
out
quite
far
from
the
device,
an
am/fm
handheld
radio
like
the
old
transistor
9v
radios
from
few
decades
back.
due
the
the
jack
sticking
out
so
far
and
not
being
90°
attachment,
it
is
already
breaking
internal
wires
causing
interruption
in
audio
after
less
than
dozen
uses.
would
not
recommend
simple
due
to
this
made
in
malaysia,
not
china!
had
been
using
cheap
three
dollar
earphones,
but
these
have
much
better
sound
quality.
so
far
they
seem
rugged
enough.
i've
dropped
one
of
them
multiple
times
but
it
still
works
fine.the
long
cord
is
plus,
as
use
it
to
listen
to
radio
while
in
bed.overall,
i'm
glad
to
be
able
to
get
these
vs
the
cheap
distorted
ones.
great
for
sleeping.
but
the
cord
is
unnecessarily
long.
tied
up
some
portion
of
it
so
don't
trip
up.
felt
grateful
and
excited
to
be
able
to
replace
the
earphones
for
an
older
but
treasured
sony
radio
with
this
perfectly
functioning
item.
we
aren't
rough
on
our
stuff,
but
the
wire
on
this
is
absolutely
too
thin.
it
does
not
fit
properly
line
cord
too
long
and
fragile.
everything
else
good
great
product
for
what
it
is.
listen
to
my
radio
at
night
-
holds
up
well,
good
sound.
ear
piece
