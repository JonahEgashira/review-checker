but
this
one
is

maybe

the

version
but
still
this
won

you
better

and

on

the

and
stay
calm
that
ll
make
your
aim
deadly
was
really
looking
forward
to
testing
these
however,
as
was
putting
them
on,
two
of
the
rings
just
ripped
the
quality
of
the
products
is
pathetic
from
the
remaining
0,
only
one
survived
it
not
like
even
overstretched
it
just
followed
the
simple
instructions
give
star
rating
if
could
was
big
fan
of
the
kontrolfreek
thumbsticks
this
let
me
down
big
time
awful
product,love
kontrol
freak
grips
but
this
truly
was
the
worst
gaming
accessory
just
makes
your
controller
feel
like
it
blocked
with
clay,i
advise
just
to
use
the
grips,only
reason
gave
it
star
is
because
had
to
do
you
have
the
strength
of
thor
in
your
thumbs
if
not,
then
this
garbage
makes
your
controller
unusable
before
you
buy:•
all
four
of
the
precision
rings
that
you
receive
in
the
package
are
considered
"hightension"
thinkcompetitor
company
"fatal
grips"
offer
similar
package
for
precision/tension
rings
that
they
have
named
"fps
aim
assist"
their
package
includes
two
hightension
rings
in
black,
and
two
lowtension
rings
in
yellow
the
reason
that
bring
this
up
is
because
fatal
grips
released
their
model
first,
and
considering
that
all
four
of
the
rings
from
kontrolfreek
are
black,
they
probably
followed
the
same
color
scheme
also
from
personal
experience
using
the
kf
rings,
they
definitely
give
lot
of
resistance
so
while
kf
doesn't
explicitly
mention
the
tension
rating,
would
say
that
it
would
be
labeled
as
"high"
considering
what
else
is
on
the
market•
considering
that
these
rings
have
high
tension,
you
pretty
much
need
stick
extensions
to
reduce
the
force
needed
to
move
your
sticks
so
that
you
can
even
use
them
properlyis
it
mistake,
or
is
it
marketing
ploy
for
kontrolfreek's
"performance
thumbsticks"/stick
extensions,
one
of
their
main
selling
points
is
that
they
"reduce
hand
fatigue";
while
their
amazon
page
currently
advertises
that
their
rings
are
"great
way
to
build
muscle
in
your
thumbs"
which
is
really
just
fancy
way
to
say
that
it
increases
hand
fatigue
and
considering
that
they
only
offer
four
hightension
rings
without
explicitly
labeling
them
as
such,
they
are
probably
hoping
that
you
are
disappointed
when
you
can't
use
the
rings
on
their
own,
and
expect
you
to
spend
more
money
on
their
stick
extensions
to
make
them
work
four
stars
for
the
product
just
because
of
the
marketing
but
with
that
being
said,
the
stick
extension
and
precision
ring
combo
is
great
performance
boost
for
fps
players
just
hope
that
in
the
future
they
explicitly
advertise
that
you
must
use
them
together,
rather
than
offering
it
as
suggestion
as
"compatible",
rather
than
necessary
additionother
comments/personal
experience:•
"allows
you
to
play
on
higher
sensitivities"they
also
advertise
that
with
these
rings,
you
can
play
on
max
sensitivities
with
ease
with
my
week
of
playing
with
them
thus
far,
can
tell
you
that
this
is
true
however,
literally
had
to
play
on
the
max
sensitivity,
and
anything
less
would
have
been
too
slow
to
play
properly,
so
you
don't
have
many
options
and
it's
not
benefit
whatsoever,
so
again
of
course
they
were
just
using
it
as
sneaky
tactic
it's
not
benefit
because
when
changed
my
sensitivity
to
max
with
the
ring
and
stick
extension
on,
the
navigation
literally
felt
exactly
the
same
understand
the
science
of
it,
where
you
are
supposed
to
have
wider
range
of
sensitivity
from
ultralow
to
ultrahigh
but
considering
that
the
material
squishes
down
whenever
you
move
it,
you
can
never
actually
fully
touch
your
stick
to
the
edge
of
the
controller
since
the
material
is
in
the
way
and
this
completely
prevents
you
from
reaping
the
benefits
of
the
increased
sensitivity,
so
again
this
is
bad
marketing
and
doesn't
represent
the
product
very
well•
from
other
reviews:
the
product
was
"sticky
and
inconsistent";
"gave
up
after
an
hour"in
this
area
will
defend
the
product
yes,
upon
first
taking
the
rings
out
of
the
package
they
are
indeed
little
"sticky"
on
the
top
and
the
bottom
and
some
of
them
do
seem
little
inconsistent
in
the
material
if
you
just
eyeball
the
edges
of
the
rings
little
bit
but
we're
just
talking
first
impressions
without
even
using
the
product
yet,
here
so
what
this
reviewer
was
saying
is
true,
but
after
using
it
for
week
it
was
never
problem
in
the
actual
gameplay
when
moving
your
stick
around,
it
is
not
sticky
or
inconsistent,
but
rather
has
smooth
and
natural
feel
quick
tip
don't
listen
to
reviewers
that
instantly
give
bad
reviews
after
using
the
product
for
one
hour
you
will
only
get
initial
reactions
i,
too,
wasn't
very
impressed
with
the
product
when
first
took
look
at
it
and
tried
it
on
my
controller
the
tension
was
high
and
it
was
actually
making
my
gameplay
worse
but
trusted
the
science
and
kept
using
it
after
day
or
two,
had
already
begun
seeing
very
good
results
but
of
course
it
will
make
your
performance
worse
from
the
get
go,
it
is
something
you
have
to
adjust
to
and
no,
it
is
not
magical
product
that
will
rapidly
make
you
an
fps
god,
but
from
my
experience
can
definitely
tell
you
that
if
you
put
at
least
hours
into
playing
with
it
and
stick
extension,
that
it
will
enhance
the
abilities
that
you
already
had,
and
overall
provide
cleaner
and
more
accurate
gameplay
without
sacrificing
speedtldr;if
buying
these
rings,
note
that
you
should
also
buy
stick
extension
in
order
to
use
them
properly
don't
fall
into
kontrolfreek's
marketing
trap
on
everything
you
read
use
your
brain
to
understand
the
science
that
they
are
proposing
try
to
read
from
reviewers
who
have
used
it
for
little
while,
rather
than
quitting
after
an
hour
but
overall,
it
is
great
product
and
it
hasn't
turned
me
into
professional,
but
it
has
definitely
emphasized
the
skills
that
had
already
had,
so
would
say
it
has
indeed
made
me
better
would
highly
recommend
five
stars
for
the
product,
four
stars
is
for
the
marketing
strategies
from
kfedit:two
weeks
into
using
the
product
daily
combined
with
highrise
kf
stick
extension,
couldn
imagine
going
back
to
playing
without
it
the
ring
itself
took
about
days
to
week
to
fully
break
in
and
lessen
some
of
the
initial
tension
out
of
the
package
which
is
good,
considering
it
was
very
rigid
in
the
beginning
it
seems
to
have
settled
at
new
tension,
and
probably
won
be
going
any
lower
after
the
initial
breaking
in
periodthis
product
has
improved
my
overall
control,
which
has
improved
my
general
aim
but
the
most
drastic
improvements
from
what
ve
noticed,
are
the
closerange
fights
using
singleburst
weapons
such
as
shotguns,
where
you
only
need
to
land
one
shot
once
you
change
your
sensitivities
with
this
product
to
reflect
similar
feeling
of
what
you
had
before,
it
basically
just
allows
you
to
have
some
more
rigidity
that
allows
you
to
be
more
accurate
if
you
re
worried
about
sacrificing
speed
for
precision,
don
be
you
can
have
the
best
of
both
worlds,
and
my
personal
game
has
greatly
improvedin
the
last
two
weeks
ve
gone
from
only
wiping
0man
squad
once
ever
in
apex
legends
ps0,
to
now
wiping
few
0man
squads
day
if
lucky
can
say
that
this
product
made
that
entire
change
on
its
own
as
ve
been
trying
harder,
but
overall
feel
more
comfortable
and
relaxed
while
using
it,
and
it
was
definitely
big
part
in
that
transformation
regardlessthe
product
is
only
$0
at
the
time
of
my
writing
this
post,
it
can
hurt
to
try
if
you
don
want
to
take
my
word
for
it
but
if
you
want
to
reap
the
full
benefits
of
the
rings,
would
recommend
combining
it
with
highrise
stick
extension
on
your
right
stick
and
nothing
on
your
left
be
patient,
and
spend
the
time
tweaking
your
settings
to
adjust
to
the
increased
tension
and
break
it
in
for
week,
and
you
ll
start
seeing
great
results
it
process
just
trust
the
science,
be
patient,
and
soon
enough
your
game
will
improve
see
lot
of
pros
talking
about
the
importance
of
increased
stick
tension
for
fps
games,
and
usually
those
are
mods
that
you
can
only
custom
order
on
$0$0
controller
have
no
experience
with
custom
controllers,
but
this
product
offers
greatly
cheaper
option,
and
it
worked
very
very
well
for
me
and
call
me
crazy,
but
this
product
might
even
be
better
than
the
custom
controller
mods,
due
to
the
increased
tension
the
further
you
move
the
stick,
because
of
the
increased
tension
that
is
needed
to
move
the
stick,
the
more
the
material
is
compressed
which
is
great
for
lining
up
your
shots,
and
preventing
from
overshooting,
and
slowing
down
to
stop
onto
your
target
whereas
$0+
custom
controllers
only
have
the
same
consistent
tension
across
the
board
there
is
no
slow
down
aid
to
help
you
line
up
your
shot
so
that
the
main
benefit
that
see
for
this
$0
product
over
an
expensive
controller
mod
that
is
probably
not
as
goodanyways
that
my
incredible
experience
with
the
kf
precision
rings
it
been
great
for
improving
my
game,
and
sure
it
would
be
great
for
you
as
well
if
you
take
my
advice
but
it
up
to
you
don
take
my
word
for
it
does
the
science
make
sense
to
you
does
my
review
and
the
benefits
seem
plausible
if
you
re
serious
about
improving
your
skills
in
fps
games,
just
take
minute
to
go
over
the
benefits
of
the
product
yourself,
and
take
the
plunge
if
you
can
understand
the
science
and
think
that
it
would
be
worth
it
think
that
this
product
is
more
important
than
the
stick
extensions,
which
kf
are
most
famous
for
although
you
should
use
them
together,
and
hope
that
the
gaming
community
can
soon
discover
these,

me
to
control
all
the
guns
in
the
games
play
with
ease
expressly
the
ones
never
used
because
of
there
recoil
now
there
is
almost
none
and
can
easily
hit
all
my
shots
this
is
an
amazing
product
and
like
the
fact
they
give
you
of
them
considering
you
really
only
need
one
for
shooting
games
i'd
definitely
order
more
when
need
extra
but
for
now
got
one
for
every
controller
have
en
un
principio
batalle
para
acostumbrarme
ya
que
si
restringe
mucho
el
movimiento
de
la
palanca,
pero
despues
de
mover
la
sensiblidad
al
maximo,
la
verdad
es
que
se
noto
mucho
la
diferencia
como
ejemplo,
antes
jugaba
warzone/cod
en
una
sensibilidad
de
0,
ahorita
estoy
jugando
0,
mi
precision
al
apuntar
mejorado
demasiado,
aparte
de
que
la
alta
sensibilidad
ayuda
voltearte
mejor
mas
rapido
para
atacar
en
el
paquete
vienen
aros
cada
uno
te
dura
alrededor
del
mes
ya
que
se
van
aflojando
aun
sin
ellos
ya
me
acostumbre
jugar
una
sensibilidad
mas
alta
de
la
que
jugaba
antes
de
usarlos
these
things
are
expensive
for
what
they
are
they
are
easy
to
install
and
do
reduce
sensitivity
for
aiming,
but
it
also
reduces
the
speed
in
which
can
look
around
took
them
off
the

se

aunque

creo
que
de
alguna
manera
ese
pequeño
espacio
ayuda
que
en
verdad
no
esté
taaaaaan
rígido
definitely
not
worth
the
money
they
continually
keep
falling
off,
and
could
have
made
these
at
home
myself
for
probably
less
then
dollar
ridiculously
over
priced
and
doesn't
even
do
its
job
nope,
not
good
product
you
lose
lot
of
range
of
motion
the
whole
product
is
awkward
when
using
it
was
excited
to
see
if
these
were
going
to
be
great
new
product
from
kontrolfreek
and
was
very
disappointed
dipende

uno
microsoft
offers
some
great
resistance
so
can
use
higher

settings
even
at
the
sensitivity
was
playing
at
it
offered
much
better
control
my
only
complaint
is
that
the
description
shows
of
the
thicker
types
but
received
mix
of
the
black
harder
rings
and
the
purple
softer
rings
which
is
the
only
reason
i'm
giving
it
stars
and
not
used
the
rings
with
the
adapter

my

,should

it
these
work
really
well
with
kontrol
freek
thumbsticks
i've
been
using
these
for
two
weeks
as
of
this
review,
and
that
seems
to
be
about
the
adequate
time
for
them
to
breakin
these
offer
nice
resistance
to
my
games,
where
need
it
since
ds0
controller
sensitivity
isn't
adjustable,
like
many
pro
controllers,
these
offer
cost
effective
way
to
achieve
some
decent
results
in
gameplay
personally
like
them,
but
overall
feel
they're
very
overpriced
for
pieces
of
rubberized
foam
longevity
if
the
product
is
questionable
at
this
point,
but
i'll
amend
my
review
if
quality
of
the
product
deteriorates
not
exactly
what
was
thinking
but
they
do
help
me
out
little
bit
with
my
golf
swing
and
will
definitely
get
better
the
more
use
them
but
they
come
in
tight
cardboard
envelope
so
they
are
squished
and
not
really
level
in
their
circumstance
but
imagine
in
time
they
might
expand
back
okay
this
is
the
updated
where
tell
you
that
they
did
expand
little
but
they
are
still
not
uniform
and
they
get
caught
in
the
housing
of
the
toggle
and
get
torn
and
then
you
have
the
pieces
of
it
down
in
between
the
toggle
and
housing
just
mess
and
not
worth
the
money
these
really
didn't
do
what
was
expecting
was
thinking
the
rings
would
be
bit
more
flexible,
but
they
are
rigid
enough
that
all
they
do
is
just
restrict
the
movement
of
the
sticks
from
0%
to
about
0%
was
wanting
something
to
add
some
tension
to
the
sticks
but
all
this
does
is
stop
the
outer
stick
movement
used
them
on
ps0
and
took
them
right
back
off
awesome
was
very
skeptical
about
these
at
first
play
mostly
shooter
games
on
ps0
and
i've
always
been
horrible
at
over
correcting
when
turned
to
engage
an
enemy
these
provide
the
resistance
that
need
to
slow
my
turn
rate
they
are
very
stiff
at
first
and
will
take
some
getting
used
to
high
recommend
getting
the
performance
thumbsticks,
mine
are
kontrol
freek
fps
but
any
will
do
as
long
as
the
they
are
elevated
some
will
help
with
moving
the
control
sticki've
seen
the
reviews
about
the
stiffness
of
the
rings,
the
material
will
relax
the
more
it's
used
like
other
reviews,
i've
had
these
for
about
week
and
wouldn't
consider
going
back
highly
advise
only
using
on
right
thumbstick
for
fps,
as
stunting
running
movement
is
not
suggested
initially
bumped
sensitivity
up
0,
but
moved
it
back
down
after
break
in
so
im
still
up
and
it
feels
very
natural
as
if
didn't
change
it
at
all,
however
the
reaction
is
there
if
need
it
wish
controllers
came
stock
with
this
kind
of
tension
feel
little
ripped
off
because
if
the
price,
it's
basically
foam
washer
that
probably
costs
cents
to
make,
but
don't
know
where
you'd
buy
these
at
costs,
so
for
what
they
do
it's
decent
price
i'd
say
about
$0
would
be
more
realistic
tbh
these
are
not
game
changing
they
might
work
better
on
an
xbone
controller
bc
the
joysticks
are
longer
they
have
very
inconsistent
and
sticky
type
of
resistance
its
almost
uncomfortable
played
for
about
an
hour
and
gave
up,
taking
it
off
my
right
joystick
kontrol
freeks
cqcx's
are
there
best
product
imo,
can't
play
without
one
on
the
right
stick
little
underwhelming
at
first
right
out
the
packaging
similar
to
mattresses
you
purchase
in
boxes,
let
the
rings
air
about
until
they
filled
out
they
were
slightly
tacky,
as
others
mentioned,
but
it
doesn't
hinder
gaming
at
alli
had
my
reservations
about
these,
but
until
tried
them,
can
see
why
having
adjustable
tension
on
sticks
being
game
changer
personally
found
them
to
feel
fantastic,
and
can't
go
back
to
playing
without
them
ingame,
did
had
to
practically
max
out
the
sensitivity
on
all
the
games
playmy
only
gripe,
and
the
reason
gave
these
0,
is
that
all
rings
seem
to
be
the
same
tension
really
wish
this
wasn't
the
case,
as
having
one
on
the
left
stick
makes
it
almost
impossible
to
run
in
certain
gamesit's
probably
best
purchasing
from
different
company
at
slightly
higher
retail
price
solely
because
they
offer
rings
at
different
degrees
of
tension
very
good
idea,
can
work
well
in
tandem
with
kontrol
freek
thumbsticks
greatly
helps
you
fight
recoil
on
fps
games,
but
can
be
inconsistent
and
find
myself
rotating
my
joysticks
around
to
find
"sweet
spot"
where
they
are
not
too
firm
or
too
soft
one
way
or
another
even
after
breaking
them
in
for
about
weeks
now
that
inconsistency
is
big
down
side
but
there
is
obviously
much
upside
as
i've
gone
from
med/high
sensitivity
to
almost
max
on
games
like
pubg,
r0
siege,
etc
ok,
at
first
looking
at
them
in
the
package
you
think,
yeah
this
will
work
you
put
them
on,
fiddle
with
the
knobs,
sure
this
should
slow
me
down
then
you
start
playing
cod
what
worthless
pieces
of
crap
they
won't
allow
you
to
sprint
they
won't
allow
you
to
turn
rapidly
tried
to
pull
them
off
mid
game,
because
like
said,
crap,
and
tore
both
of
them
trying
to
remove
them
would
highly
recommend
learning
to
control
your
sticks
better
on
your
own
because
these
will
not
help
you
the
only
reason
they
got
one
star,
is
because
they
don't
offer
the
capability
of
rating
with
negative
stars
i'm
po'd
just
thinking
about
these
thingsif
you
want
to
make
obscene
amounts
of
money
off
of
unsuspecting
newbs,
then
this
is
the
stuff
you
sell
$0
for
tiny
foam
discs
only
wish
would've
thought
of
it
first
fool
me
once,
shame
on
me
truly
wasn't
expecting
something
as
effective
easy
enough
to
remove
if
need

on

since

love
these

they
are
an
amazing
idea
and
invention
that
wish
had

of

basically
these
make
it
so
you
can
run
high
sensitivity
but
there's
buffer
so
your
bot
totally
out
of
control,
use
them
for
fps,
cod
warzone
to
be
exact,
but
if
you
need
to
spin
around
real
quick
but
still
have
control
for
aiming
perfect
snipe
shot,
then
these
are
for
you
excellent
product,
use
the
mediums
but
to
each
their
own
used
these
on
and
off
for
few
weeks
these
rings
were
well
packaged
and
easy
to
install
however,
getting
the
thumbsticks
to
the
far
edges
of
motion
is
extremely
difficult
if
the
resistance
was
uniform
throughout
the
travel
of
the
stick,
these
rings
would
be
great
you
will
find
yourself
aiming
short,
especially
on
the
horizontal
eventually
you
may
get
used
to
this,
but
gave
it
an
honest
shot
and
could
never
overcome
this
flaw
this
is
miracle

used

these

made

turned

up

even

and
would
say
that
will
be

with

my

they
have
served

lot
to

the
very
casing
of
my

against
the
force
that
unintentionally
exert
while
playing
and
that
causes
it
to
break
should
buy
more
units
because
they
wear
out
fast
with
frequent
use
it
works
what
else
is
there
to
say
such
simple
accessory
&
concept
think
to
myself
wow,
pretty
sure
definitely
couldve
made
one
of
these
had
thought
of
it
it
does
exactly
whats
advertised;
allows
you
to
play
at
higher
sensitivities
while
still
maintaining
control,
which
is
nice
since,
technically,
having
higher
sensitivity
is
always
bonus
in
fps
games
however,
just
keep
in
mind
that
using
the
ring
will
make
playing
lower
sensitives
much
harder
which
isn
big
deal,
it
basically
just
raises
the
minimum
baseline
amount
of
sensitivity
that
can
be
used
effectively
while
also
giving
you
more
room
and
opportunity
to
increase
and
control
your
sensitivities
to
levels
you
may
not
have
previously
been
comfortable
with
results
will
definitely
vary
slightly
depending
on
what
controller
youre
using
ie
scuf
vantage
vs
dualshock
b/c
of
the
default
thumbstick
heights
but
nonetheless,
it
ll
do
its
job
on
any

you
chooseall
in
all,
its
good

and
both
tried
them
out
and
we
both
agree,
they're
trash
hope
this
helps
always
had
problem
with
aim
with
fps,
even
at
low
sensitivities
the
rings
took
some
getting
used
to,
but
seem
to
help
with
the
over
aiming
especially
when
surprised
was
able
to
push
up
the
sensitivity
overall
feel
it
is
beneficial
product
the
pros
of
this
product
is
it
does
what
it
what
its
ment
to
do,
adds
resistance
to
your
control
stick
you
will
have
to
increase
sensitivity
to
the
max
though
but
it's
very
easy
to
control
also
very
easy
to
install
no
hassle
the
cons
of
this
product
are
that
its
rings
with
only
one
level
of
resistance,
wish
it
had
light
and
heavy
resistance
rings
they
are
overpriced
should
cost
half
the
amount
also
it
does
take
time
to
loosen
up
the
rings
so
they
arnt
too
tight
lastly
you
definitely
need
there
tumb
sticks
seems
like
marketing
ploy
but
worth
it
if
you
want
precision
it
works
as
advertised
as
long
as
you
dont
use
an
extended
thumbstick
like
the
one
that
comes
with
the
xbox
elite
v0
controller
if
you
use
the
thumbsticks
that
are
standard
height,
this
works
great
but
as
soon
as
you
use
the
longer
thumbstick,
adding
another
ring
prevents
the
stick
from
extending
all
the
way
around
so
the
radius
is
much
smaller
really
love
this
product
works
great
with
playstation
controller
im
sure
they
work
great
with
any
controller
they
really
limit
the
motion,
so
for
sensitive
games
this
product
comes
in
handy
was
always
little
rough
with
the
joystick
so
when
use
it
with
game
like
mlb
or
0k0
this
will
come
in
handy
to
score
those
points
would
definitely
recommend
to
anyone
with
ps0
that
has
issues
with
over
using
the
joystick,
or
putting
too
much
pressure
on
it
0/0
pretty
simple,
pretty
genius
ok
i'm
write
this
review
so
people
don't
get
confused
on
this
product
it
works
perfectly
as
it
should
don't
use
the
precision
ring
on
the
left
thumbstick
otherwise
you
won't
be
able
to
get
your
character
to
fully
move
he'll
be
walking
slowly
so
just
use
the
precision
ring
on
the
right
stick
would
only
recommend
these
precision
rings
for
call
of
duty
because
it's
just
aiming
the
whole
time
tried
this
in
fortnite
and
it
actually
made
my
aim
inconsistent
because
of
the
building
sensitivities
along
with
the
aiming
sensitivities
other
than
that
this
product
is
insane
these
help
lot,
play
ps0
call
duty
modern
warfare
am
not
the
best
player
in
these
really
help
my
game
lot
was
able
to
raise
my
sensitivity
from
to
big
difference
able
to
snap
around
quicker
not
over
snap
overall
improving
my
game
do
wish
this
product
came
with
different
stiffness
levels
as
to
found
it
is
harder
to
sprint
using
the
left
joystick
had
to
trim
it
down
little
bit
for
it
to
work
for
me
it
sounds
will
get
tired
and
fatigued
the
first
few
days
are
use
it
after
that
big
break
in
and
are
great
must
to
use
thumb
extensions
with
these
it's
smaller
then
thought
smaller
then
penny
can
only
imagine
the
profit
kontrol
freak
is
making
off
these
things
i'm
still
not
sure
how
it's
effecting
my
accuracy
these
came
exactly
as
described,
unfortunately
don't
think
the
concept
works
at
all
they
seem
to
just
act
as
bumpers
around
the
outer
range
of
your
stick
it
doesn't
really
add
any
resistance
in
the
"middle"
then
you
abruptly
hit
the
foam
on
the
outer
edge
trash
got
these
after
reading
very
long
and
in
depth
review
they
sounded
great
so
bought
them
man
for
bucks
these
are
awful
they
would
be
better
used
to
hold
something
together
givin
their
tight
resistance
for
use
on
competitive
gameplay,
these
don't
help
bit
your
base
aim
will
be
slowed
down
on
the
absolute
max
sensitivity
and
your
ads
will
be
slow
and
methodical
but
ain't
gonna
help
with
flicking
please
make
sure
you
understand
that
if
you
want
to
aim
slow
and
kinda
precise,
then
these
might
be
for
you
but
if
you
want
to
flick,
just
get
their
wonderful
performance
sticks
and
stay
away
from
these
my
son
really
wanted
to
try
to
these
so
purchased
them
as
gift
however,
his
feedback
was
they
didn't
really
do
anything
and
he
couldn't
tell
the
difference
ended
up
being
waste
and
we
tossed
the
product
in
the
garbage
can
play
online
video
golf
tried
them
on
my
xbox
one
controller
it
just
seemed
to
eliminate
my
feel
and
inhibit
full
swingi
don
get
it
was
hoping
for
something
that
would
enhance
my
game,
not
worsen
it
put
one
on
my
xbox
controller
and
it
really
helped
me
with
my
steering
wasn't
forcing
it
to
go
to
maximum
anymore
could
steer
with
little
bit
of
feedback
or
resistance
that
reduced
my
oversteering
these
rings
are
too
thick
for
the
ps0
controller
it
restricts
the
full
range
of
the
thumbsticks
significantly
they
need
to
be
0/0
the
thickness,
maybe
even
slightly
less
than
half
in
order
to
work
good
idea
though,
just
poor
execution
on
regular
thumbtacks,
it
is
far
too
restrictive
so
that
even
max
sensitivity
settings
are
too
low
if
i'm
trying
to
sprint
in
game,
can't
because
the
stick
doesn't
reach
far
enough
while
regular
sized
thumbstick
is
too
small
for
the
ring,
heightened
stick
makes
the
rings
useless
as
if
it's
not
even
there
if
put
rings
on
the
tall
stick
then
its
the
same
problem
againtldr:
i've
tried
every
way
to
use
these,
it's
impossible
works
as
described,
control
levels
settings
at
insane
played
until
my
eye
memory
muscle
got
it
locked
in
with
this
and
the
alert
perk
you
can
master
turning
to
the
direction
of
the
yellow
flash
in
an
instant
these
limit
range
of
motion
at
the
outer
edges
making
snap
movement
impossible
unless
you
crank
up
the
sensitivity
at
which
point,
you
re
better
off
leaving
sensitivity
alone
and
not
using
these
at
all
love
the
product
gives
you
way
more
precision
after
making
adjustments
in
the
control
settings
it's
as
if
got
an
updated
game
the
only
problems
is
the
price
it's
bit
much
for
what
it
is,
but
it
works
and
is
worth
it
if
you
can
afford
it
was
very
surprised
these
little
rings
seriously
aid
in
controlling
the
sticks
on
my
controller
they
provide
just
enough
resistance
to
keep
you
from
over
controlling
highly
recommend
them
works
as
expected,
simply
adds
some
resistance
to
movement
of
the
joysticks
on
controller,
improving
and
giving
more
stability
for
aiming
in
particular,
or
movements
of
any
kind
personally
these
weren
for
me
use
kontrol
freek
performance
thumbsticks
and
will
never
again
play
without
them
when
came
across
these
rings
thought
they
were
going
to
be
great
but
just
couldn
get
comfortable
playing
with
them
it
felt
like
my
joystick
was
broken
and
the
movement
felt
so
unnatural
gave
it
stars
because
the
product
wasn
trash
it
just
wasn
for
me
wouldn
recommend
if
you
use
performance
thumbsticks
the
idea
of
improving
your
precision
at
higher
sensitivity
with
the
foam
rings
sounds
great
until
you
try
them
out
they
are
too
dense
and
interfere
more
than
help
your
aim
had
to
place
my
sensitivity
at
for
cod
to
start
even
playing
normally
couldn
even
get
my
player
to
run
frankly
will
tell
you
to
stay
awaydon
waste
your
money,
bc
your
better
off
with
some
button
attachments
just
got
then
mainly
to
play
cod
mwim
not
the
best
shooter
player
my
aim
its
bad,but
with
this
precision
rins
it
took
my
game
to
another
leveli
went
from
0/0
kills
to
0played
with
them
on
for
straight
hoursyou
have
to
get
used
to
itat
first
feels
super
stiffnote
with
them
went
way
up
on
sensitivity
on
game
settings
was
surprised
on
how
much
joystick
resistance
these
actually
gave
i've
thought
about
cutting
them
down
bit
to
see
if
thinner
ring
would
suit
me
better
these
will
not
fix
'stick
drift'
issues
have
slight
drift
on
my
right
joystick
all
together
not
bad
product
but
asis;
they
just
aren't
for
me
am
still
in
the
training
phase
with
these
on
my
xb0
so
far
they
are
doing
very
well
will
continue
to
buy
kontrolfreek
products
great
idea
will
need
more
practice
but
think
will
soon
be
pro
gives
him
so
much
more
control
he
said
he
went
from
"kills"
to
after
installing
that
with
the
concaved
thumbsticks
they
do
the
opposite
of
what
is
promised
my
joystick
movement
is
so
constrained
that
can't
aim
quickly
and
get
killed
in
game
do
not
buy
these
they
are
waste
of
money
have
kf
grips
and
love
them
but
these
are
not
good
product
they
make
it
very
hard
to
move
around
even
with
high
sensitivity
make
you
feel
sluggish
and
slow
and
dont
help
with
aim
very
much
if
at
all
if
recommend
not
buying
these
figured
maybe
these
reviews
were
wrong
but
they
arent
dont
waste
ur
time
it
let
you
play
on
high
sensitivity
and
it
feels
like
you
playing
on
low
wean
you
put
it
on
your
not
going
to
want
to
take
it
off
if
you
have
the
money
to
spare,
it's
worth
try
have
these
on
one
of
my
controllers
and
it
works
fine,
but
don't
believe
that
they
achieve
any
more
than
playing
with
your
aim
sensitivity
settings
would
such
small
thing
to
make
such
big
difference
if
your
controller
drifts
from
normal
abuse
put
these
on
your
replacement
you
will
greatly
extend
the
life
of
your
controller
no
more
drifting
off
cliffs
not
quite
as
good
as
thought
well
compared
to
the
competition
from
gaimx
and
fps
aimassist
it
made
it
to
difficult
to
move
the
controller
quickly
and
complicated
gameplay
it
would
seem
like
these
would
work
well
but,
gave
two
of
the
rings
out
and
the
two
remaining
both
ripped
when
putting
them
on
ordered
these
for
use
in
rpg
ended
up
taking
them
off
may
work
well
as
intended
for
first
person
shooter
this
obstructs
all
rapid
movement,
whether
your
trying
to
maneuver
the
character
or
the
weapon,
it
prevents
you
from
rapidly
doing
anything,
think
they
made
the
ring
tad
bit
to
thick
it
stiffing's
an
immobilizes,
even
when
shuffling
thru
your
load
outs
,
glad
tried
it
out
first
,
ordered
another
for
my
grand
son
and
that
found
its'
way
to
the
trash
as
well
one
the
xbox
one
controlled
they
slide
up
the
stem
of
the
thumbstick
and
are
not
as
effective
after
few
uses
my
son
said
the
really
helped
with
grin
and
movement
of
the
joysticks
on
the
controller
he
loves
them
kontrol
freek
needs
some
quality
control
right
side
for
ps0
left
side
for
xbox
product
is
great
just
wish
there
were
thicknesses
for
the
product
it
comes
with
pairs
of
the
same
serve
to
decrease
accidental
activation
in
the
heat
of
action
in
fps
the
product
is
only
good
if
can
afford
to
use
new
ring
after
every
few
gaming
sessions
basically
useless
after
few
game
sessions
as
the
ring
quickly
loses
it
density
and
you
are
back
to
square
one
so
maybe
if
you
re
pro
gamer
who
can
afford
to
use
new
ring
everyday
it
makes
sense,
but
for
the
average
joe,
don
waste
your
money
just
form
rubber,
gets
in
the
way
when
using
the
anolog
sticks,
tair
easy
your

video
received
rip
off
fake
items
in
clear
bag
that
was
not
control
freak
it
was
rubber
instead
of
the
original
material
that
control
freak
and
users
so
it
was
scam
planning
on
contacting
control
freak
and
letting
them
know
so
they
can
see
or
take
action
or
whatever
they
want
to
do
for
false
advertisement
and
fast
sales
the
product
was
to
thick
for
joystick
to
move
properly
had
to
cut
it
in
half
now
its
works
pretty
good
these
things
are
absolutely
worthless
they
slow
you
down
way
too
much
kontrol
freek
dropped
the
ball
on
this
one
these
are
well
made,
but
make
sure
you
know
which
strength/model
you
need
had
other
brands
and
these
are
especially
stiff
every
thing
was
missing
use
kontrol
freeks
thumb
caps
with
these
and
have
no
complaints
in
fact
need
more
for
some
different
options
to
play
with
was
skeptical,
but
spent
some
time
playing
with
my
settings
and
think
ive
found
"the
sweet
spot"i
only
used
one
ring,
right
stick
xbox
one
id
recommend
gave
it
three
stars,
tried
it
for
few
days
and
placed
them
in
drawer
have
my
sensitivity
at
highcall
of
duty
and
this
really
helps
me
have
perfect
control
on
it
really
enjoy
them
takes
the
wobble
out
of
racing
games
for
me
these
made
simple
movements
more
difficult
even
on
higher
sensitivites
see
what
they
are
going
with
but
in
games
like
apex
legends
unable
to
select
heals/grenades
they
do
make
difference
took
chance
and
it
payed
off
don
recommend
this
not
necessary
at
all
it
make
it
to
hard
to
move
and
think
you
just
need
to
adjust
your
sensitivity
of
your
controller
wasted
my
money
use
them
daily
on
my
scuf
definitely
would
recommend
these
of
the
rings
were
deformed
one
ripped
and
unusable
the
other
creased
and
warped
it
won
let
me
upload
pic
got
these
thinging
it
would
help
but
there
just
lil
to
thick
if
they
where
just
lil
thinner
the
would
be
perfect
so
that
being
said
think
the
way
the
are
they
suck
you
can
even
move
with
them
on
the
controller
save
your
money
needs
to
be
thicker,
but
it
works
restricted
movement
of
the
toggle
to
much
the
product
should
be
third
of
the
thickness
cut
the
the
rings
in
half
with
pair
of
scissors
and
the
rings
still
restricted
the
movement
to
much
good
idea
poor
design
they
work
great
on
ps0
controllers
because
the
toggles
are
taller
waste
of
money
for
sure
to
stuff
on
ps0
won
even
let
me
move
in
the
game
without
extreme
pressure
don
get
it
ended
up
returning
love
these
rings
they
help
me
shoot
lot
better
in
games
will
be
buying
more
interfered
with
being
able
to
click
your
thumbstick
def
waste
of
money
for
fps
games
where
you
click
to
sprint
good
product
it's
doesn't
work
as
good
as
other
products
available
but
it
will
get
job
done
it
does
the
job
from
grinding
away
the
analog
sticks
but
if
it
is
game
where
you
have
to
push
down
the
analog
stick
and
run
it
just
to
thick
was
prepared
to
send
these
back
but
they
worked
for
me
really
helps
my
aim
they
serve
their
purpose
well
just
not
for
me,
bought
these
thinking
it
would
just
provide
tension
but
they're
really
not
that
flexible
and
restricts
good
percent
of
your
movement
of
the
sticks
to
the
point
you
can
just
barely
make
little
circles
perfect
good
controller
stabilization
worth
the
price
you
will
not
regret
it
will
help
your
aim
they
are
thin
though
great
product
came
super
fast
got
these
for
halo
but
it
has
way
to
much
resistance
even
on
maxed
out
sensitivity
if
they
were
like
0/0
as
thick
they
would
probably
work
out
but
as
is
its
very
high
resistence
and
therefore
not
functional
my
husband
uses
these
for
ps0
just
not
worth
usd
usd
would
be
more
appropriate
great
item
worthless,
don't
waste
your
money
makes
sprinting
impossible
in
cod
also,
get
ready
for
thumb
workout
dont
know
who
to
be
mad
at
kontrol
freek
or
myself
save
your
money
used
it
to
make
the
ultimate
controller
with
every
feature
could
find
on
internet
would
add
an
image
of
when
its
finsished
but
absolutely
do
not
understand
the
point
of
this
product
it
works
nothing
like
advertised,
or
at
all,
for
that
matter
would
not
recommend
buying
it
these
thing
limit
your
stick
movement
so
much
it
is
almost
impossible
to
play
most
games
threw
them
out
after
one
night
of
fighting
with
them
waste
of
$
the
came
dented
and
twisted
it
is
literally
just
piece
of
foam
could
of
made
better
one
at
home
opened
these
up
and
all
were
smashed
on
one
side
like
something
was
laying
on
them
for
while
and
they
won't
go
back
to
their
normal
shape,
will
try
to
get
my
money
back
why
didn't
think
of
this
perfect
for
those
who
are
kinda
sloppy
with
the
thumbsticks
and
for
those
who
are
just
seeking
more
accurate
aim
works
good
getting
used
to
it
still
good
product
for
aim
assistance
but
tryong
yo
remove
them
could
cause
damage
them
pointless
does
what
it
says,
it
does
allow
you
to
have
higher
sensitivity
only
down
side
is
it
makes
it
hard
to
sprint
trying
to
boost
my
game
with
controller
attachments
when
it
comes
to
fps
these
don't
help,
well
didnt
help
me
why
did
waste
my
money
don't
buy
product
was
good
but
just
not
for
me
play
everyday
and
this
actually
made
it
difficult
to
turn
the
sticks
and
gave
it
too
much
resistance
will
never
buy
this
prodact
againi
install
it
on
my
ps0
controller
and
play
call
of
dutyyou
cant
move
left
and
rightthe
movment
is
bad
only
comes
with
the
black
foam
pieces
only
wanted
the
purple
ones
the
package
says
types
of
rings
its
waste
of
dollars
problably
cost
cents
to
make
put
them
on
my
controller
and
my
aim
got
better,
truth
in
advertising
they
are
definitely
worth
the
money
if
you
are
concerned
with
your
k/d
ratio
didn
do
anything
besides
make
the
joysticks
unusable
in
call
of
duty
can
sprint
with
them
on
the
controller
these
have
help
improve
my
gameplay
so
much
used
to
be
all
over
the
place
when
aiming
can
actually
enjoy
fps
games
because
of
these
over
priced
all
rings
are
the
same
they
are
inconsistent
sometimes
stick
has
less
tension
when
aiming
left
then
right
or
vis
versa
absolutely
useless
these
really
limit
your
range
of
motion
to
much
they
make
your
thumb
tired
and
games
hard
to
play
like
the
response
now
only
use
it
on
one
side
though
cool
great
product
it
provides
nice
grade
of
smooth
sensibility
and
mobility
when
aimingprobably
the
best
i've
tried
doesn
work
and
had
to
cut
them
off
my
controller
shipped
as
described
yet
to
test
them,
but
quality
looks
great
and
feels
good
love
it
works
great
jus
wish
there
were
different
sizes
for
different
resistance
these
are
awesome,
you
can
use
higher
sensitivity
and
still
have
control
these
are
great
for
cod
my
son
liked
them
until
he
loss
them
can't
blame
that
on
the
product
can't
sprint
properly
waste
of
money
these
are
terrible
don
buy
did
nothing
waste
of
money
the
ring
restricts
movement
to
much
for
my
liking
it
also
restricts
actions
related
clicking
the
joystick
worst
product
ever
restricted
on
all
movement
on
thumbsticks
do
not
buy
work
for
me
if
your
having
difficulty
getting
you
aim
right
then
buy
them
recommend
to
my
friends
and
there
aim
is
better
too
love
it
needs
little
getting
used
to
but
very
useful
worth
the
money
totally
helps
with
your
gaming
control
wouldnt
recommend
these
to
any
one
waste
of
money
it
even
messed
my
controller
up
more
love
these
just
break
them
in
for
week
stick
it
through
and
you
won
go
back
to
using
your
controller
without
they
restrict
too
much
movement,
don
recommend
for
sports
games
too
big
for
series
controller,
wasn't
able
to
sprint
or
turn
all
the
way
with
them
on
just
foam
washer
basically
they
are
way
to
stiff
&
get
stuck
under
the
analog
sticks
definitely
not
worth
it,
made
it
to
stiff
and
unable
to
run
save
your
money
like
them,
it
was
exactly
what
was
expecting,
am
very
happy
with
my
purchase
just
to
stiff
they
look
like
they
were
used,
and
misshaped
these
are
just
foam
circles
for
dollars
great
product
they
are
the
worst
$0
ve
ever
spent
literal
trash
to
thick
not
allowing
full
range
of
motion
junk
the
seem
well
made
this
product
sucks
ass
work
great
but
wished
they
had
different
sizes
helps
me
win
warzone
games
:
they
went
into
my
controller
really
amazing
product
worked
good
for
me
works
very
well
love
them
no
good
wrong
product
