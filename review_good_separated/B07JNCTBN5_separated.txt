excelentes
audífonos,
mejor
de
lo
que
hubiera
pensado,
me
encantaron
really
wanted
to
love
these
earbuds
they
ended
up
being
mixed
bag
of
pros
and
cons
several
things
the
manufacturer
touted,
have
found
to
be
highly
accurate
the
range
using
bluetooth
is
phenomenal
they
stay
connected
perhaps
times
farther
than
my
older
buds
making
phone
calls
is
delight
for
someone
with
hearing
disability
like
me
got
clear,
stereo
reception
with
great
volume
and
the
far
end
of
the
connection
couldn
tell
was
using
them,
it
was
so
clear
don
use
my
buds
primarily
for
music,
but
found
them
personally
to
be
at
least
adequate
the
bass
was
noticeable
and
mid/highs
at
least
distinctive
comfort
is
an
individual
thing,
so
your
mileage
will
certainly
vary
they
felt
ok
to
me,
although
they
like
to
fall
out
haven
tried
all
the
earpiece
sizes
or
hook
attachments
yet,
so
it
may
yet
improve
not
show
stopper
for
me,
since
don
use
them
for
sports
or
exercise
battery
life
thus
far
has
met
or
exceeded
advertising
claims
don
know
how
long
they
last,
ve
never
been
able
to
wear
them
to
the
point
of
battery
death
ve
worn
them
watching
tv
for
hours
at
stretch
and
they
lasted
strong
all
the
way
though
the
case
is
simple
and
recharges
them
quite
fast,
as
advertised
pairing
was
easy
and
once
paired,
they
stayed
connected
with
zero
drops
they
don
always
automatically
reconnect
immediately
to
the
tv
when
put
them
on,
but
eventually
they
make
the
handshake
the
big
downside
for
me
and
where
the
advertising
was
less
than
accurate
or
truthful
is
latency
purchased
these
specifically
for
television
due
to
hearing
problems
know
these
buds
are
built
on
qualcomm
soc,
supposedly
with
aptx
built
in
there
are
multiple
aptx
codecs
and
aptxll
is
it
own
distinctive
codec
clearly,
the
high
fidelity
aptx
codices
are
on
board,
but
these
buds
don
register
with
my
aptxll
retransmitter
or
devices
already
know
broadcast
in
ll
the
latency
with
tv
and
video
is
very
noticeable
and
nowhere
near
what
know
is
possible
using
aptxll
codex
calling
these
low
latency
in
advertising
is
complete
falsehood
and
defeats
the
purpose
of
having
bought
them
to
begin
with
that
for
me
is
the
show
stopper
really
wanted
to
love
these
things,
but
can
have
been
weighing
the
airpods
against
the
jabra
0t
for
while
have
pixel

but
neither
of
these

all
the
other

to
give

quite
good,

some
may
prefer
this
anyway
coming

is

on

really
use
them
for

stintsrange
is
good
though
as
with
most
things,
having
more
obstructions

reduce
the
rangehave
not
had
any
unexpected
dropping
audio

issues
sometimes
when
they
transition
from

to

you
can
tell
they

i'm
kind

surprised
they
are
asking
so
much
for
them
when
they
are
likely
to
get
lost
in
sea
of
other
sub$0
earbuds
that
are
mostly
just
rebranded
clones
don't
be
fooled
though
even
with
these
shortcomings
they
are
backed
by
much
newer
chipset
than
most
other
true
wireless
earbuds
and
thusly
have
impressed
me
quite
bit
have
received
airx
for
while
and
tested
all
the
functions
am
satisfied
that
airx
is
the
top
of
truewireless

in
this
price
range,
strongly
recommend
to
get
one
if
you
re
looking
for
high
performance
and
acceptable
price
of
truewireless
products
even
this
brand
has
not
spread
out
their

in

but
airx

is
somehow
the

as

hit

they

bragi/jabra,
they

and
they
connect

so
you

use
either

the

give
props

broadcast

they
made

mavin
airx
shot
you
won't
regret
it
so,
i've
been
purchasing
cheap
chinese
audio
products
for
while
now
i've
bought
some
qcy/qy0
headphones
while
back
and
they
were
wireless,
but
tethered
to
each
other
and
the
sound
quality
on
them
was
great
and
largely
due
to
the
fact
that
they
had
the
qualcomm
aptx
codec
builtin
fast
forward
through
couple
of
tws
earbuds
i've
tried
and
they
all
had
ok
to
subpar
audio
performance,
but
most
of
all
they
had
very
poor
battery
life
mean,
we're
talking
about
an
hour
of
playback
time
at
full
volume
would
have
to
play
at
full
max
to
get
good
soundi
told
myself
was
done
with
cheap
earbud
alternatives,
wanted
something
with
good
audio
aptx
capable
if
possible
and
decent
battery
life
after
some
research,
qualcomm
listed
these
earbuds
on
their
website
and
did
some
researching
and
saw
that
they
had
an
indiegogo
site
that
didn't
hit
their
goal,
so
just
assumed
they
were
defunked
however,
was
impressed
with
all
their
claims
of
hours
of
battery,
0ft
bt
range,
and
audio
quality
after
some
more
digging,
found
that
they
were
selling
product
on
amazon
and
without
hesitation
pulled
the
triggerthese
earbuds
sound
absolutely
amazing
high
fidelity
audio
you
can
really
hear
the
highs
and
lows
from
these
earbuds
think
with
any
tws
earbuds,
bass
is
always
going
to
have
issues
just
because
it's
trying
to
reproduce
the
low
end
noise
in
such
small
form
factor
however,
these
do
the
job
incredibly
well
obviously,
these
won't
replace
your
overtheear
headphones
in
terms
of
audio,
but
for
tws
these
are
really
dynamic
have
not
tried
the
jabra
elite
or
bose
soundsport
free
but
based
on
other
reviews,
it
seems
like
they
are
either
on
par
or
exceed
their
quality
as
far
as
volume,
these
earbuds
are
loud
partly
due
to
aptx
codec
but
what
am
averaging
0%
volume
on
my
device
and
it's
plentyas
far
as
the
battery,
i'm
going
on
hours
of
nonstop
playback
and
not
hit
the
half
way
mark
yet
on
the
battery
indicator
mavin
also
claims
that
you
get
0%
better
battery
life
with
snapdragon
powered
mobile
phone
due
to
optimization
which
have
if
the
battery
holds
and
doesn't
deprecate
over
the
next
few
months
then
will
be
extremely
impressedthe
sport
stabilizer
ear
pieces
are
also
nice
touch
it's
added
security
and
it
doesn't
add
any
mass
to
the
buds
well,
at
least
not
that
you
can
tell
it
does
great
job
holding
them
in
place
would
recommend
having
these
on
all
the
time
to
avoid
any
slippagethings
wish
they
added:
ability
to
connect
to
more
than
bt
device
have
this
on
some
other
headphones
and
it's
great
feature
so
you
don't
have
to
toggle
back
and
forth
having
multiple
devices
connected
to
the
earbuds
disables
the
auto
pairing
feature
it
may
just
be
confused
on
which
one
to
pair
the
auto
pair
feature
is
sometimes
hit
or
miss
as
well,
even
when
paired
to
one
device
it
could
also
be
human
error
and
me
just
rushing
the
device
to
connect
will
report
back
if
it
is
an
ongoing
issuealso
one
person
noted
that
there's
no
battery
indicator
if
you
have
an
android,
the
battery
indicator
should
show
up
next
to
the
bt
symbol
in
your
notification
bar
on
your
phone
month
update:
after
month
these
are
working
just
fine
have
noticed
if
left
alone
for
few
days
they
do
not
power
on
upon
removal
from
the
case
you
have
to
manually
press
the
button
on
the
buds
to
get
them
to
turn
on
think
this
is
to
prevent
the
phantom
battery
drain
that
other
buds
seem
to
suffer
with
even
if
you
leave
them
alone
for
few
days
the
case
and
buds
upon
removal
seem
to
have
the
same
charge
level
furthermore,
the
hinge
on
the
case
wiggles
bit
now,
even
though
have
babied
them
it
doesn't
appear
to
affect
functionality
but
hope
it
doesn't
degrade
any
further
finally,
i've
had
few
bugs
such
as
the
right
not
playing
audio
even
though
it
was
the
primary
connected
to
my
phone,
audio
cutting
out
every
other
second,
and
random
refusal
to
connect
to
my
s0
plus
putting
them
back
in
the
case
and
taking
them
out
again
fixed
the
issue
every
time
but
i've
never
experienced
such
frequent
and
erratic
behavior
with
my
other
twessummary:
in
at
$0
the
airxs
face
serious
competition,
which
the
qualcomm
chip
doesn
fully
justify
the
case
is
only
bit
larger
than
the
airpods
the
airpods
case
is
about
thick,
where
the
airxs
is
bit
over
and
the
battery
life
is
phenomenal
the
range
and
audio
quality
are
only
marginally
better
than
my
much
older
bragi
the
headphone,
which
are
now
under
$0about
me:
have
at
least
bluetooth
headphones
around
the
house
carry
four
pairs
in
my
backpack
every
day
because
they
all
have
different
strengths
my
taotronics
are
very
loud
and
have
ridiculous
bass,
my
tranyas
twes
have
excellent
sound
quality
but
poor
range,
and
my
bragi
twes
have
an
extremely
stable
connection
heard
about
the
new
qualcomm
chip
and
own
us
version
s0+
with
sd
0,
which
is
why
purchased
the
airxs
my
main
headphones
are
the
sony
xm0s,
which
probably
listen
to
on
average
six
hours
day
my
main
twes
are
the
bragi
the
headphone,
which
after
nearly
two
years
of
regular
use
are
only
able
to
hold
about
three
hours
of
charge
originally,
was
just
going
to
get
another
set
of
the
bragi
since
they
re
only
about
$0
but
then
saw
the
airxs,
which
really
seemed
ideal
for
my
purpose
wanted
twes
that
were
sweat
resistant
with
small
portable
case
or
that
could
be
easily
carried
without
case,
at
least
hours
of
battery
life,
and
had
very
stable
connection
the
airxs
do
the
first
two
very
well
but
they
have
several
irritating
issues
that
really
detract
from
the
overall
experiencethe
qualcomm
chip:
the
main
problem
that
all
twes
face
is
connecting
the
primary
and
secondary
together
to
deliver
stereo
audio
most
cheap
twes
use
bluetooth
to
connect
both,
however
bt
signals
cannot
travel
through
water,
so
blasting
signal
through
the
human
skull
is
simply
not
possible
instead
they
have
to
use
walls
to
eventually
bounce
the
bt
signal
to
the
other
bud
others,
like
the
bragi,
use
induction
to
connect
the
two
buds
together,
which
even
with
bt
delivers
really
stable
connection
the
new
qualcomm
chip
fixes
this
issue
by
connecting
both
buds
to
your
sd
or
phone
this
is
supposed
to
theoretically
reduce
latency,
strengthen
connection,
and
improve
battery
life
only
really
experienced
the
last
benefit
over
the
bragi
sshortcomings:
the
air
xs
have
respectable
audio
quality
with
great
channel
separation,
volume
to
spare,
and
decent
bass
they
tend
to
sometimes
overdo
the
highs
and
they
have
very
loud
poweron
hiss
nearly,
all
bluetooth
headphones
have
tried
have
this
poweron
hiss;
however,
it
is
extremely
loud
on
the
airxs
in
certain
quiet
songs
find
it
to
be
very
distracting
if
you
plan
on
using
the
airxs
for
only
working
out
or
other
physical
activities,
then
you
may
be
able
to
tune
out
the
hissthe
fit
is
also
just
mediocre
the
charging
contacts
protrude
aggressively
and
without
the
wingtip
sleeves
that
level
out
the
contacts,
the
airxs
are
very
uncomfortable
to
wear
they
also
come
with
triangular
tips
that
are
not
for
human
ears
ended
up
finding
another
regular
hemispherical
pair
that
just
happened
to
fit
my
ears
and
the
airxs
around
my
house
furthermore,
they
use
push
buttons
that
require
really
firm
jab
to
respond
my
bragi
also
have
push
buttons
but
they
require
way
less
pressure
to
activate
mavin
also
decided
to
cram
all
regular
headphone
features
volume,
track
changing,
assistants,
calls
on
only
two
buttons
so,
there
is
complicated
click
pattern
that
deters
me
from
using
the
controls
volume
up
is
single
click
which
is
typically
play/pause
pause
is
long
press,
while
play
is
single
click
you
cannot
change
the
volume
too
quickly
or
you
will
skip
tracks
basically,
the
controls
are
mess
and
wish
there
was
an
app
that
could
let
me
reassign
the
functions
finally,
the
notification
tones
connection
status,
track
paused,
and
such
are
all
played
on
max
volume,
which
is
absolutely
infuriating
and
great
way
to
go
deaf
every
time
you
remove
them
from
the
case
and
put
them
in
your
ears
they
will
scream,connected
bleep
bleep
bloop
connectedi
have
now
trained
myself
to
wait
about
three
seconds
after
taking
them
out
of
the
case
for
them
to
finish
their
process
several
times
they
have
also
randomly
bleeped
and
blooped
on
max
in
my
ears
for
no
reason
nothing
in
the
manual
mentions
what
these
noises
mean
in
total,
with
the
hiss,
the
obnoxiously
loud
notifications,
bad
controls,
bad
ear
fit,
seriously
think
no
one
at
mavin
actually
put
these
into
their
ears
it
as
if
the
whole
product
is
largely
just
test
bed
for
qualcomm
also
went
into
developer
settings
on
my
phone
and
manually
switched
from
aptx
to
sbc,
which
know
is
inferior
to
see
if
it
would
reduce
the
hiss
unfortunately,
it
did
nottesting
claims:
as
for
the
range,
have
not
tested
line
of
sight
range,
but
indoor
range
is
equivalent
to
my
bragi
can
basically
walk
ten
feet
with
one
thin
door
between
my
phone
and
the
buds
and
begin
to
experience
interruptions
also,
are
both
buds
supposed
to
show
up
as
connected
to
the
phone
typically,
for
me
only
one
is
connected,
usually,
whichever
pulled
first
from
the
case
once,
both
showed
up
as
connected
but
have
not
been
able
to
replicate
that
again
so,
am
not
sure
what
benefit
is
offered
by
the
qualcomm
chip
since
they
just
fall
back
into
primarysecondary
mode
if
put
the
one
that
is
connected
to
my
phone
in
the
case,
it
will
cut
audio
from
the
other
bud
as
well
furthermore,
cannot
go
into
settings
and
force
connect
to
the
bud
have
to
place
it
back
into
the
case
and
then
take
it
out
again
also,
if
they
lose
connection,
which
happened
to
me
once
when
got
too
far
from
my
phone
in
my
house,
they
would
not
autoreconnect
could
not
even
force
them
to
reconnect
again
had
to
put
them
back
into
the
case
and
take
them
out
again
in
this
respect,
they
are
worse
than
every
other
bluetooth
headphone
ownas
for
the
battery
life,
have
listened
to
them
continuously
for
about
four
hours,
with
my
phone
reporting
the
right
bud
battery
around
0%
so,
at
about
0%
volume
ten
hours
may
be
possible
fully
charging
the
buds
dropped
the
case
battery
life
from
0%
to
about
percent
to
flasheswrapup:
recommend
the
airx
if
the
incredible
battery
life
and
the
small
case
produce
greater
benefit
than
the
lousy
controls,
bad
design,
deafening
notification
tones,
dependence
on
flagship
level
android
phone,
mediocre
range
and
the
hiss
otherwise,
consider
something
from
more
established
brand0
week
update:
had
these
in
my
ears
the
whole
day
with
nearly
hours
of
music
playing
constantly
at
about
0%
volume
the
left
bud,
which
was
connected
to
my
phone
reported
0%
battery
life
around
hours
so,
put
both
back
into
the
case
and
then
immediately
pulled
out
the
right
bud,
which
after
it
connected
showed
0%
battery
listened
to
just
the
right
bud
for
about
hours,
while
the
left
charged
in
the
case
then
pulled
the
left
out
and
listened
to
them
both
for
another
hours,
with
the
right's
battery
at
about
0%
after
hours
so,
the
battery
life
is
years
ahead
of
anything
on
the
market
right
now
assuming
you
have
the
right
phone
and
they
are
reporting
accurately
it
is
also
possible
that
the
left
just
went
through
some
odd
bug
that
caused
the
wide
battery
percent
gap
between
two
so,
it
may
have
been
able
to
last
even
longer
if
had
simply
ignored
its
bloop
putting
them
back
in
the
case
case
at
0%
overnight
charged
them
up
fully
with
about
0%
case
battery
still
remaining
these
are
also
now
being
sold
at
$0,
which
is
seriously
competitive
considering
the
tech
these
have
so
during
the
time
that
the
product
worked
for
me
it
worked
really
well
the
battery
life
seems
to
live
up
to
it's
hours
never
bothered
testing
further
than
hoursi
had
about
0%
left
and
the
sound
quality
is
pretty
good
the
connection
was
very
strong
and
loved
being
able
to
use
either
left
or
right
by
themselves
however,
had
to
factory
reset
my
phone
one
day
and
then
also
reset
the
earbuds
normal
reset,
removing
pairing
info
to
connect
to
phone
again
however
the
right
earbud
for
some
reason
could
not
work
on
it's
own
anymore
so
decided
to
factory
reset
now
the
earbuds
will
not
pair
to
each
other,
and
customer
support
is
unresponsive
even
the
guides
yes
there
is
0,
the
one
under
product
support
and
the
one
in
the
user
manual
provide
different
information
making
it
even
more
confusing
if
there
is
an
issue
with
yours
good
luck
getting
customer
support
to
even
respond
bought
these
true
wireless
earbuds
because
sometimes
the
wires
on
my
great
sennheiser
m0's
are
just
not
long
enough
and
pull
the
earpieces
out
of
my
ears
the
idea
of
having
true
wireless
earbuds
appealed
to
me
and
the
reviews
sounded
good
on
these
when
they
arrived,
made
sure
they
were
fully
charged
before
even
tried
them
in
my
ears
they
sounded
really
good
and
felt
fairly
comfortable,
although
didn't
try
other
size
earpieces
that
came
with
ok,
so
far
when
was
getting
ready
to
out
and
exercise,
put
them
in
my
ears
and
they
would
not
connect
to
my
samsung
galaxy
s0
thought
it
was
odd
because
had
no
trouble
connecting
them
when
got
them
no
matter
what
did,
these
earbuds
would
not
connect
again
with
my
phone
hated
to
send
them
back,
but
if
they
didn't
work,
they
didn't
work
this
may
have
been
fluke,
but
having
problem
with
one
pair
was
enough
to
steer
me
away
from
the
product
the
earbuds
so
far
have
lived
up
to
their
battery
life
claims
haven't
had
them
run
out
of
juice
even
once
yet
when
first
tried
using
them
they
were
uncomfortable,
but
using
the
sport
stabilizers
seemed
to
make
them
for
better
for
some
reason
on
occasion
when
there's
no
sound
playing
you
can
hear
quiet
buzzing
noise
can't
say
that
i've
tested
it
much,
but
the
ipx0
rating
seems
to
be
accurate
the
earbuds
have
great
range
and
hold
very
stable
connection
i've
been
about
to
listen
to
music
on
my
phone
with
few
walls
obstructing
the
signal
with
minimal
connection
issues
under
normal
usage
haven't
had
the
signal
drop
out
skip
another
plus
to
these
earbuds
is
the
fact
that
you
can
use
each
one
individually
i've
only
taken
handful
of
calls
with
them,
but
was
told
that
the
microphone
quality
seemed
acceptable
it
was
also
nice
hearing
the
phonecall
in
both
ears
an
excellent
combination
of
size,
sound,
and
stylepairing
and
connecting:
bluetooth
enables
quick
initial
pairing,
as
well
as
fast
reconnects
when
removed
from

for
use
each
time
maintaining
connection
with
phone
even
when
phone
is
in
front
pants
pocket
has
been
rock
solid
really
like
how
it's
easy
to
switch
from
two
earbuds
to
one
on
the
fly,
or
by
activating
one
bud
by
taking
only
one
out
of

quality:
well
balanced,
high
quality,
impressive

considering
it
doesn't
have

one
of
the
best,
based
on
my
experience
with
jabra,

extremely
pleased
with
the
balance
of
quality
and
features
of
the
above
categories
now
taking
over
as
my
daily
commuter
and
yardwork
buds,
which
was
previously
dominated
by
sol
republic
was
blown
away
with
these
earbuds
never
did
imagine
that
something
this
small
could
perform
so
welli
purchased
the
sennheiser
momentum
true
wireless
buds
to
get
the
best
quality
with
true
wireless
earbuds
and
then
these
popped
up
week
later
since
testing
them
out
can
say
they
have
extremely
similar
sound
to
the
sennheiser
earbuds,
equal
distance
for
strong
connection
and
somehow
an
everlasting
battery
life
my
one
gripe
with
the
mavin
buds
is
the
poor
quality
of
design
and
lack
of
features
the
sennheiser
momentum
and
many
others
have
hearthrough
feature
that
these
could
benefit
the
case
for
these
is
fine
and
all,
but
the
buds
themselves
are
made
with
some
poor
materials
and
the
little
bump
where
the
connector
pins
are
have
habit
of
scratching
my
ear
canal
the
provided
sleeves
make
the
fit
nicer
but
it
often
slides
around
and
have
to
fix
itthe
truewireless
stereo
plus
qualcomm
chips
in
the
mavin
are
the
reason
originally
purchased
these
and
am
happy
did
cannot
wait
for
more
companies
to
adopt
this
tech
just
hope
mavin
and
more
will
understand
that
tactile
buttons
suck
and
sennheiser
knew
what
they
were
doing
by
adding
capacitive
touch
buttons
no
clicking
and
jamming
the
earbuds
into
my
ears
regret
that
will
be
returning
these
bought
these
after
exhaustively
searching
wireless
earbuds
online
and
in
stores
hard
to
find
much
information
on
the
brand,
but
they
were
using
quality
components
speaker
diaphragms,
batteries,
qualcomm
chipset
and
the
features
described
seemed
almost
unbelievablefiguring
could
return
if
the
goods
didn
meet
expectations,
ordered

what
fantastic
decision
and
product
kudos
to
the
team
at
mavin
for
making
something
that
truly
transcends
consumerism
and
represents
the
pursuit
of
excellence
in
product
design
and
executionsound
quality
is
better
than
expected—they
are
earbuds,
not
open

was
still
surprised
by
the

this
sold
me
these
checked
all
my
boxes
for
$0
bucksi
inquired
to
seller
aia
store
amazon
marketplace
about
the
same
buds
on
amazon
listed
for
$0,
whetheror
not
these
were
real
or
"knock
offs"he
responded:
"there
is
no
difference
between
their
$0
ship
from
jp
and
our
hot
sale
pricing
of
$0
in
us"sure
enough,
these
arrived
via
prime
new
in
mavin
retail
packaging,
in
excellent
condition
glad
asked
highly
recommend
really
like
how
pocketable
this
product
is
would
have
preferred
matted
black
case
instead
of
the
piano
black
just
because
overtime
it
will
get
lot
of
visible
scratches
would
have
also
preferred
usbc
port
to
charge
opposed
to
micro
usb
the
other
thing
is
the
silicon
material
used
for
the
wing
tips
collects
lot
of
lint
unlike
others
that
so
not
this
is
real
negative
would
have
also
preferred
the
control
buttons
to
be
on
the
side
or
touch
function
vs
the
press
button
because
it
causes
the
earbud
when
pressed
to
unseal
and
also
jams
them
into
the
ear
canal
overall
really
like
this
earbuds
and
can't
wait
for
version
i've
tried
few
diff
pairs
of
ear
buds,
some
you
have
to
pair
multiple
times,
they're
uncomfortable
and
you
have
to
shove
them
far
in
to
your
ear
to
get
decent
sound
haven't
had
any
of
that
with
these
they're
comfortable,
they
charge
in
the
case
pretty
fast,
and
the
sound
quality
including
bass
works
for
mei
guess
it
would
also
depend
on
what
song
you're
listening
to,
but
these
are
for
keeps
as
far
as
i'm
concernedi
don't
use
these
daily,

when

i'd

and
recommend
to

these
earbuds
sound
great,
but
the
first
thing
you
need
to
do
when
you
get
them
is
to
replace
the
silicone
tips
with
set
of
memory
foam
tips
0mm
inlet
for
better
sound
isolation
the
earbuds
tend
to
be
uncomfortable
at
first,
found
that
memory
foam
tips
significantly
alleviate
that
problem
bass
is
really
punchy,
lows
and

are
crisp
once
you
get
good

battery
life
is
great
don't
listen

i'm
getting
well

the
problemthese
buds
have
grown
on
me
over
the
past
week
they're
loud,
clear
and
have
really
punchy
basswell
worth
the
money
battery
life:
stellar
use
them
all
day
at
work,
charge
them
at
lunchtime,
and
they
don't
die
even
when
go
to
the
gym
right
afterwardsfit:
fits
great
they
were
little
slippery
when
was
working
up
sweat,
but
once
put
the
sweat
fins
on,
they
fit
and
don't
feel
loosesound
quality:
excellent
i've
owned
airpods
and
the
original
powerbeats
tried
the
new
powerbeats
but
those
were
too
bassy
for
me
and
the
hook
is
uncomfortable
these
are
betterconnectivity:
have
had
dropouts
in
fact,
often
forget
my
phone
and
walk
distance
away
before
realizing
because
the
range
is
so
good
most
apps
adjust
for
latency
automatically
so
there's
no
video
sync
issuescons:
the
only
cons
are
the
lack
of
touch
controls
end
up
taking
out
one
ear
bud
when
changing
the
volume
so
don't
push
it
in
my
earoverall:
these
are
great
set
of
tws
earphones
and
exceeded
my
expectations
with
regards
to
sound
quality,
battery
life,
and
range
first
and
foremost,
ive
tried
few
different
recent
iterations
of
the
"true"
wireless
bluetooth
earbuds
that
includes
sennheiser's
momentum
true
wireless
in
my
opinion,
these
are
honestly
far
better
value,
and
better
producttl;dr
these
are
phenomenal
,
buy
them
sound:
they
sound
excellent
,
aptx
ensures
that
the
fact
that
they
also
support
aac
is
nice
touch
for
the
apple
users
considering
purchasing
these
do
they
sound
as
good
as
the
sennheisers
no
but
they
sound
0%
as
good
,
and
have
other
pros
that
make
them
no
brainercomfort:
out
the
box
wasn't
fan
of
how
they
fit
in
my
ears
with
the
stock
silicon
tips
they
weren't
terrible,
but
they
didn't
seal
up
as
tight
as
id
like
fortunately
had
plenty
of
knockoff
comply
foam
tips
ive
purchased
for
other
earbuds
in
the
past
in
bulk
from
china
and
managed
to
fit
them
on
it
was
very
tight
fit
getting
them
on,
but
what
game
changer
with
the
foam
tips
the
bass
tightened
up
quite
bit
and
the
sound
improved
markedly
they
sit
comfortably
in
the
ear
and
and
can
definitely
handle
the
gym
or
going
for
runconnection:
nothing
to
say
here
,
connection
was
rock
solid
whether
its
bluetooth
or
the
fact
that
these
earbuds
dont
use
the
regular
"master
,
slave
"
mentality
most
other
earbuds
use
,
connection
was
phenomenal
each
earbud
gets
audio
sent
to
it
independently
versus
going
to
one
earbud
first
than
relayed
to
the
othercall
quality:
fantastic

quality
,
call
goes
to
both

and
not
just
one
both
ear
buds
also
have
good
mic
and
people
on
the
other
end
of
the
call
couldn't
tell
was
using
pair
of
earbuds
to
talk
to
them
no

design
:
what
really
like
about
these
earbuds
is
that
because
they
dont
use
the
traditional
master
/
slave
design
,
each
ear
bud
can
be
used
separately
for
example,
you
can
pull
out
either
left
or
right
ear
bud
on
its
own
and
it
will
function
just
fine
,

absolutely
awesome
that
you
dont
always
have
to
use
the

together
the
buttons
on
each

are
also
very

and
pretty
intuitive

pretty
accurate
from

im

snapdragon

mileage
may
varypairing:
pairs
like
any
other
bluetooth

no

,
no
problems
pairing
simpleoverall
these
are
fantastic
,
found
them
few
months
ago
on
qualcomms
aptx
website
whilst
looking
for
good
pair
of
true
wireless
earbuds
hoping
theyve
implemented
aptx
in
any
of
them
yet
at
the
time
these
were
on
indigogo
and
not
released
,
im
very
happy
theyve
made
it
to
production
and
are
actually
being
sold
because
they
have
certainly
raised
the
bar
in
my
eyes
from
what
id
expect
from
pair
of
"true"
wireless
bluetooth
earbuds
best
purchase
ive
made
in
while
these
bluetooth
wireless
buds
have
an
amazing
battery
life
the
sound
is
fairly
decent
highquality
it
could
use
little
bit
more
bass
but
it's
not
completely
baseless
either
the
ability
to
pair
each
one
individually
was
awesome
the
newest
bluetooth
technology
and
range
was
amazing
these
bluetooth
earbuds
have
so
much
potential
the
only
problem
that
found
was
that
they
hurt
my
ears
they
did
not
fit
in
my
ears
and
it
was
not
because
of
my
ears
it's
because
the
design
and
the
shape
i've
tried
out
mini
bluetooth
earbuds
in
the
shape
of
these
just
it
any
length
of
time
minutes
minutes
they
hurt
my
ears
they're
too
wide
and
too
large
for
most
people's
ears
maybe
in
second
generation
if
they
were
to
correct
this
and
add
little
bass
so
that
you
can
have
little
more
bass
heavy
sounds
these
would
be
the
most
perfect
earbuds
so
far
i'm
increasingly
impressed
with
the
overall
quality
of
these
i've
been
usinga
beats
wireless
headset
for
the
past
years
beats
held
up
well
for
my
to
hours
of
daily
use
for
both
phone
calls
and
music
and
decided
to
upgrade
when
started
getting
buzzing
out
of
one
ear
piece
tried
true
wireless
headset
by
alterola
and
was
sorely
disappointed
by
the
sound
quality
or
lack
there
of
kept
the
volume
maxed
out
and
still
could
barely
hear
some
phone
calls
that's
not
good
enough
and
not
in
the
same
league
as
beats
as
far
as
sound
goes
so
went
back
to
shopping
and
bought
these
by
mavin
damn
what
difference
true
wireless
yet
still
even
beats
near
wireless
can't
compare
to
the
volume
and
sound
quality
of
these
i'm
impressed
battery
life
is
solid
as
well
generally
am
using
the
left
ear
piece
solo
but
for
whatever
reason
if
the
right
bud
is
not
within
range
the
left
doesn't
work
either
i'm
assuming
the
right
bud
is
the
main
ear
piece
and
do
would
be
nice
if
they
made
them
both
completly
stand
alone
not
complaining
just
saying
overall
they're
pretty
impressive
for
the
price
these
can't
be
beat
have
used
these
earbuds
for
over
month
now
at
the
gym
and
offshore
working
and
have
had
no
issues
with
them
at
all
while
the
sound
isn't
audiophile
perfect
it
is
very
good
with
just
enough
bass
for
what
use
them
for
they
fit
good
in
the
ear
and
can't
even
make
them
fall
out
no
matter
how
hard
move
and
shake
my
head
battery
life
is
excellenti
charged
the
case
before
going
offshore
for
weeks
and
charged
it
once
while
was
out
there
not
even
sure
had
to
charge
it
just
did
after
weeks
and
they
are
still
going
strong
pairing
to
my
phone
was
very
easy,
just
push
the
button
on
the
case
and
paired
they
are
so
good
ordered
another
set
for
my
wife
and
she
loves
them
too
battery
life
on
these
is
amazing
especially
when
you
consider
how
small
they
are
these
are
based
on
qualcomm
chipset
which
is
why
the
battery
life
is
so
good
each
earbud
lasts
0+
hours
playtime,
actually
haven't
tested
them
to
the
full
extent
of
battery
life
yet
can't
say
how
many
charges
the
case
offers
but
can
tell
you
that
use
each
earbud
approx
0hrs
day
days
week
and
charge
the
case
maybe
every
weeks
so
do
the
math
haha
essentially
get
0+
hours
of
playback
with
the
case
before
charge
it
because
use
the
earbuds
separatelywhat
like
most
is
the
ability
to
use
them
independent
of
each
other
they
appear
on
the
phone
as
airx
and
airx
sometimes
when
switching
them
you
need
to
go
into
your
bluetooth
settings
on
phone
and
connect
to
the
bud
you
want
to
use
they
do
sync
up
perfectly
when
they
are
both
out
of
the
case,
think
the
right
is
primary
there
in
no
ergonomic
difference
between
then
so
am
able
to
insert
both
buds
into
my
right
ear
left
bud
fits
upside
down
since
that's
my
preference
when
only
using
one
when
using
them
independently
they
operate
the
same;
they
can
both
answer
calls
and
button
functions
are
the
same
single
press
to
play
music
or
answer
calls,
sec
press
to
pause/reject
call,
sec
press
to
call
up
google
assistant
when
nothing
is
payingyou
cannot
change
volume
without
both
connected
the
button
logic
is
little
annoying
you
have
to
hold
button
down
for
second
you'll
hear
single
chime
to
pause
song
but
if
you
hold
it
for
seconds
chimes
it
disconnects
and
goes
into
pairing
mode
seconds
chimes
turns
off
earbud,
and
so
onthey
are
little
pricey,
i'm
no
audiophile
but
they
sound
really
good
to
me,
love
how
small
they
are
and
the
case
is
small
enough
to
fit
into
the
change
pocket
on
my
jeans
these
earbuds
were
exactly
what
was
looking
for
was
looking
for
in
early
true
wireless
buds
that
were
light
and
comfortable,
and
tried
the
jabra
elites
and
the
samsung
galaxy
buds
the
jabras
sounded
great
but
they
were
just
little
too
bulky
and
uncomfortable
over
long
periods
of
use
samsung's
were
super
comfortable
but
the
sound
lacke
depththe
mavin
air
matches
if
not
exceeds
the
best
qualities
if
the
jabras
and
the
galaxy
buds
they
sound
as
good
if
not
better
than
the
jabras,
with
deep
punchy
bass
and
crisp
trebles
once
put
the
sport
fins
on
they
were
as
comfortable
if
not
more
comfortable
than
the
galaxy
buds
they
don't
fall
out
ever
at
the
gym,
and
barely
even
move
when
i'm
running,
doing
sit
ups,
jump
roping
or
even
hitting
the
heavy
bag
found
the
galaxy
buds
were
snug
but
needed
to
be
wedged
in
deep
to
stay
snug,
whereas
the
mavins
just
kinda
rest
in
my
ear
canal
and
never
causes
ear
fatigue
wore
these
on
hour
flight
plus
another
hour
at
the
airport
and
my
ears
never
got
tired,
just
little
sweatybattery
life
is
as
promised
i've
had
these
for
weeks
and
have
never
seen
the
battery
read
below
0%
and
still
haven't
charged
the
case
was
waiting
for
it
to
die
before
wrote
review
but
it
just
refuses
to
aside
from
my
flight
wear
them
about
hrs
day
for
the
gym
and
sporadically
throughout
the
day,
so
i'm
not
heavy
user,
but
i'm
damn
impressed
nonethelessrange
is
good
along
as
there
are
no
walls
between
you
and
the
device
but
hardly
ever
use
these
from
across
the
room
so
it's
really
non
issuemy
only
wish
is
listenthrough
feature
like
the
jabras
or
even
the
galaxy
buds
but
it's
not
really
huge
problem
for
me
anyway
since
they
function
independently
can
pop
one
out
if
someone
is
talking
to
me
it
doesn't
stop
playing
music
when
you
take
them
out
of
your
ear
the
way
samsung
or
the
jabras
do,
which
can
be
downside
for
some
peoplei
searched
all
over
for
the
perfect
true
wireless
buds
and
i'm
glad
gave
these
shot
wish
more
companies
would
use
the
qualcomm
tech
in
these
cuz
it's
seriously
revolutionary
i'm
frankly
shocked
don't
see
more
reviews
of
these
online
they
blow
the
mainstream
buds
out
of
the
water
in
performance,
not
to
mention
value
these
are
an
amazing
pair
of
tws
earbuds
the
sound
quality
is
incredible
the
bass
is
very
good,
the
best
i've
heard
from
any
other
earbud
they
dont
sound
muddy
there
i'd
the
tiniest
amount
of
lag
when
watching
youtube,
and
is
even
more
present
if
you
watch
kodi
this
is
on
my
note
0,
aptx
protocol
enabled
for
bluetooth
the
sound
seems
to
sync
up
around
seconds
after
the
video
is
started
it
doesn't
bother
me
since
bought
these
for
music
they
are
little
uncomfortable
for
me
after
extensive
wear,
not
unbearable
though
just
wouldn't
be
able
to
wear
them
hours
straight
ended
up
needing
the
wingtips
to
keep
them
in
my
ear
so
like
that
they
were
included
overall
would
purchase
again
over
the
years
have
used
many
different
bluetooth
headsets
my
favorite
up
until
now
was
the
jaybird
line,
had
the
and
x0
models
over
the
years
the
mavin
earbuds
having
no
wire
to
bounce
around
while
am
running
makes
for
completely
different
better
experience
the
earbuds
are
super
comfortable
and
stay
in
my
ears
surprisingly
well
do
use
the
included
sport
covers
which
provide
little
bit
of
extra
retention
while
exercising
but
the
sport
covers
are
probably
not
neededthe
battery
life
is
incredible
have
never
had
the
earbuds
run
out
of
charge,
including
on
the
weekends
when
will
wear
them
almost
all
day
working
on
projects
charge
the
case
once
per
weekthe
range
is
far
better
than
any
other
bluetooth
headset
have
ever
used
can
put
my
phone
on
charge
in
the
center
of
my
house
~0sq
ft
and
go
anywhere
in
my
house
without
any
connectivity
issuesi
do
agree
with
others
that
the
logo
is
too
big
have
the
black
earbuds
and
couple
of
coats
with
black
sharpie
has
"fixed"
the
logo
on
the
earbuds
don't
care
about
the
logo
on
the
case
as
it
is
normally
in
my
pocket
i've
tried
many
ear
buds
from
galaxy
gear
to
sol
republic
and
more
in
my
quest
to
find
solid
pair
to
use
for
work
these
mavins
are
really
good
was
skeptical
at
first
because
at
first
glance
they
look
kind
of
cheap
in
comparison
to
the
other
major
brands
the
buds
themselves
are
lighter
than
expected
pros
the
battery
life
is
crazy
have
not
ran
them
dead
yet
and
longest
went
so
far
it's
about
0/0
hours
straight
on
one
bud,
the
sound
is
pretty
good
has
enough
in
all
eq
areas,
they
pair
fairly
easy,
they
charge
pretty
quick
full
less
than
hour,
live
up
to
the
ft
range
cons
they
fit
pretty
good
and
don't
fall
out
but
not
as
comfortable
for
me
as
other
brands
i've
tried
samsung's
are
most
comfortable
out
of
the
ones
i've
tried,
when
using
one
bud
at
time
none
of
the
button
functions
work
can't
skip
tracks
or
pause
or
playhave
not
tried
call
functionality
with
one
bud,
by
far
the
best
bass
was
sol
republic
amps
air
hands
down
but
these
do
have
good
bass
response
no
usb
cable
for
charging
and
think
this
should
be
standard
by
now,
there
is
no
companion
app
for
these
which
would
be
cool
and
make
customizing
your
sound
easy
as
well
as
button
assignment,
no
internal
storagewhich
really
like
about
the
samsung
buds
all
in
all
these
are
solid
purchase
for
anyone
needing
long
battery
life
and
good
sound
i'm
more
than
happy
because
before
i'd
have
to
have
more
than
one
pair
of
buds
to
switch
out
as
they
went
dead
or
go
without
music
for
major
portion
of
my
work
day
and
the
fact
that
they
have
good
sound,
individual
bud
use,
great
range
and
superior
battery
life
totally
worth
the
money
only
spent
$0
and
have
spent
more
for
less
with
other
brands
hope
this
long
review
helps
someone
else

these
shipped
several
days
before
they
were
supposed
to,
they
were
listed
to
be
in
stock
on
the
0th
expecting
delivery
on
the
0th
or
later
and
received
them
on
the
0ndmy
only
complaint
is
the
mavin
logo
on
the
earbuds
it's
not
so
bad,
they
look
much
better
than
most
wireless
earbuds,
and
you
can
easily
buy
decal
sticker
and
cut
it

have0/0
hope
these
get
the
recognition
they
deserve
terrible
with
electronics
but
love
music
wanted
something
comfortable
an
apple
user
but
their
earbuds
hurt
ve
had
theses
for
about
week
and
they
are
comfortable
and
come
with
different
size
tips
and
two
different
size
cover
pieces
to
help
stay
in
ears
say
that
to
say
there
will
be
configuration
that
for
you
ve
only
charged
my
case
once
and
it
still
more
than
halfway
charged
for
songs
that
switch
sides
it
does
that
it
has
great
bass
but
not
over
powering
and
have
no
issues
with
delays
in
videos
also
the
individual
use
is
great
right
or
left
as
soon
as
take
one
out
of
the
case
it
automatically
connects
to
my
phone
great
buy
and
completely
worth
it
have
no
opinion
on
the
distance
thing
because
haven
tried
it
my
phone
is
usually
in
my
pocket
bought
these
headphones
after
hearing
about
them
almost
year
ago
the
qualcomm
qcc0
chip
really,
really
solves
nearly
all
the
issues
that
twes
have
had
to
this
point
the
airx's
sound
amazing
the
bass
is
boomy
and
the
highs/mids
are
perfectly
crisp
there
is
no
audio/video
lag,
probably
because
of
both
the
bt
and
the
fact
that
the
true
stereo
plus
enabled
by
the
chip
allows
each
bud
to
be
paired
separatelyat
the
same
time
the
tips
included
will
more
than
likely
fit
everyone,
and
the
sports
stabilizers
will
probably
help
the
rest
they
really
do
have
amazing
battery
lifei've
had
to
charge
the
case
once
in
almost
week
of
use
heavy
use
the
range
is
amazing
as
well,
just
be
careful
of
walls/obstructions
they're
small,
discreet
and
the
case
is
near
copy
of
the
airpods
casethe
big,
big
caveat
of
these
features
is
that
the
qcc0
requires
either
the
snapdragon
or
processor
on
board
your
device
to
be
fully
utilized
have
lg
g0
thinq
so
my
phone
supports
it
sadly,
only
phones
from
perhaps
the
last
year
or
two
will
have
the
galaxy
s0,
pixel
0,
oneplus
0/0t,
xperia
zx0/0
etc
this
may
explain
why
this
tech
is
not
more
widely
used
in
twes
currently
give
the
market
year
or
two
more
and
we
may
see
more
buds
with
this
amazing
chip
in
themit's
definitely
worth
itif
you
have
the
right
device
to
pair
them
withpscareful
with
the
case
after
dropping
it
once
the
hinge
is
slightly
loose
and
kinda
creaks
now
wonder
how
many
reviews
were
bought
by
the
company
the
claims
about
sound
quality
and
battery
life
are
all
true,
the
niggling
bits
like
no
firmware
update
with
an
app
and
sometimes
clunky
controls
are
also
true
but
no
reviews
mention
that
the
microphone
sucks
especially
in
environments
louder
than
mouse
whispering
city
street
noise
makes
it
difficult
for
me
to
be
heard
sometimes
it
is
easier
to
hear
the
noise
around
me
than
me
trying
to
talk
on
bus
is
an
exercise
in
futility,
either
all
the
other
person
hears
is
grabbled
noise
or
have
to
practically
shout
to
only
barely
be
heard
first
would
like
to
say
can
take
these
things
out
of
my
ears
really
enjoy
listening
to
my
music
for
hours
while
walking
and
working
in
the
yard
yes
did
purchase
the
foam
ear
tips
and
that
have
improved
the
comfort
and
seal
now
you
must
have
snapdragon
or
chipset
for
all
us
android
users
to
get
the
best
results
from
these
earbuds
just
keep
that
in
mind
as
you
make
your
decision
to
purchase
these
buds
very
happy
with
these
earbud
selection
and
they
check
all
my
desires:
loud
enough;
bass;
mids;
and
highs
give
them
try
and
start
enjoying
your
wireless
earbud
experience
these
sound
amazing
surprisingly
good
bass
the
battery
last
all
day
connection
is
pretty
good
about
0ft
for
me
was
expecting
better
but
was
only
0ft
away
to
test
it
no
reason
to
be
0ft
away
from
your
phone
lol
love
that
one
side
isn't
slave
to
another
they
both
work
independently
from
one
another
if
you
just
use
it
for
hands
free
calling
they
isolate
outside
sound
very
well
can
be
bad
thing
it's
like
putting
in
earplugs
por0
was
standing
0ft

i'm
sure
five

is
enough
but
my

need
longer
talk
time
and
thinking
it'll
be
while
until
they
die
they
do
the

seems
like
fifty
hour's
but
i'm
making
sure
it's
doing
exactly
what
is
being
claimed
microphone
on
the
first
night
picked
up
morse
code
or
something
and
background
noise
is
always
constant
conversation
can
be
difficult
at
times
since
your
voice
might
not
be
heard
depending
the
locationi
thought
found
my
replacement
for
the
collar,
which
is
the
point
of
removing
the
sensation
of
something
gripping
on
your
neck
but
can
really
say
it'll
be
worth
it
right
now
it's
an
endless
race
to
early
preview
you
want
it
than
get
it
now
or
be
patient
until
the
technology
is
perfect
with
cheaper
price
tag
the
inear
driver
portion
of
the
earbud
is
over
0mm
in
diameter
don't
have
small
earholes,
but
unless
you
have
earholes
the
size
of
the
grand
canyon
or
want
to
pierce
your
ear
canals,
ya
ain't
gonna
get
them
in
or
to
stay
in
sound
was
tinny
at
best
with
no
perceivable
bass
and
little
midrange
as
well
even
turning
my
head
slightly
and
gently,
the
earbuds
fell
out
all
the
supplied
tips
were
pretty
much
the
same
size,
ie
large
and
the
covers
that
were
supposed
to
help
retain
the
buds
in
the
ear
actually
made
getting
the
earbud
in
the
ear
and
keeping
it
there
actually
made
it
worse
very
dissatisfied
with
the
product
especially
considering
they
cost
over
$0
sound
is
important
to
me
the
airx
has
excellent
sound,
but
no
were
close
to
ft
more
like
but
most
of
the
time
have
my
watch
on
the
mike
is
joke
but
they
sound
so
good
i'm
giving
it
stars
sounds
better
than
jabra
elite,
looks
and
sound
is
better
than
bose
sport
better
than
galaxy
buds
and
they
are
comfortable
they
all
lack
somewhere
i'm
keeping
these
because
they
of
the
sound,
comfort,
look
and
they
can
really
hold
hold
charge
the
silicone
ear
tips
on
the
ear
pod
become
loose
much
too
soon
just
over
month
and
get
stuck
in
your
ear
but
this
happens
after
the
return
period
ends
range,
and
sound
are
very
good
the
fit
is
good
until
ear
tip
stretch
happens
and
then
the
user
become
frustrated
having
to
dig
the
silicone
tip
out
of
the
ear
and
resorts
back
to
much
cheaper
pair
that
the
ear
tips
are
still
fitting
well
even
though
have
had
them
much
longer
pros:battery

pocketablecons/wishlist:in

wish
there
was
way
to
tell
remaining
battery
life
on
the
earbuds
while
in
use
maybe
companion
appaptxhd
would
have
been
niceno
active
noise
cancelling
great
alternatives
for
airpods
get
little
uncomfortable
after
an
hour
of
wearing
it,
and
the
design
is
little
too
geometric
would
have
preferred
more
rounded
edge
design
great
button
functionality
too,
so
much
functions
with
two
buttons
another
con
have
is
the
seal
it's
good,
but
not
good
enough
to
hear
that
really
good
bass
might
return,
depending
if
the
week
goes
by
good
with
theseupdate:
have
it
an
extra
when
putting
it
in
my
ears
bass
got
clearer,
sound
got
super
great
easily
hands
down
better
balance
sound
compared
to
my
bsimb
wireless
earbuds
which
by
the
way,
are
really
good
also
so
far
im
really
lovin
thease
battery
life
is
best
iv
owned
and
this
is
at
least
my
tenth
pair
of
true
wireless
earbuds
im
not
sure
on
the
range
yet
but
for
sound
its
great
and
will
update
if
distance
is
not
as
advertised
but
as
of
this
moment
thease
are
definitely
my
favorite
the
sound
and
performance
are
great
they
sound
as
good
as
my
low
end
wired
iems
the
battery
will
get
me
through
my
work
day
if
it
is
charged
fully
can
wander
around
my
office
without
any
interruption
of
bluetooth
however
the
reason
knocked
couple
of
stars
is
that
the
case
will
not
charge
the
ear
buds
past
0%
unless
it
is
plugged
in
while
charging
update:
made
two
calls
today,
and
the
other
party
could
not
hear
my
voice
could
hear
the
other
party's
voice
no
way,
could
only
return
hope
that
manufacturers
will
solve
this
problem,
will
buy
this
product
again
merchant
have
received
the
return
for
long
time,
why
not
refund
the
money,
where
should
go
to
complain
this
headphones
are
nice
the
sound
is
good
and
all
this
last
for
one
day
with
one
charge
connection
is
rarely
brakes
but
only
when
i'm
far
away
from
my
phone
but
can't
say
that
is
ft
range,
little
bit
less
but
it
is
not
problem
the
real
problem
met
after
weeks
of
exploitation:
that
earbud
were
made
from
two
parts
attached
with
glue
and
some
construction
set,
when
you
using
them
too
often
you
notice
that
this
parts
moves
little
bit
and
making
squeaky
sound
but
overall
this
is
good
tws
with
lightweight
eadburds
but
also
with
build
problems
these
earbuds
are
better
than
anything
ve
ever
purchased
ve
owned
whole
lot
of
earbuds
and
none
of
them
compare
to
the
airx
battery
life
or
sound
quality
just
wish
we
could
get
the
red
and
white
ones
through
amazon
as
well
these
are
unique
type
of
wireless
headphones
they
have
amazing
battery
life
the
sound
was
the
peculiar
thing
about
these
headphones
they
sound
good,
you
get
certain
clarity
with
these
headphones
you
ll
notice
background
noises
for
video
or
movie
if
you
like
bass
these
do
not
have
enough
bass,
even
if
you
change
the
ear
tipsthey
are
very
loud
but
for
the
price
expected
betteri
ve
tried
several
different
wireless
headphones
in
my
honest
opinion,
only
recommend
this
for
someone,
who
would
enjoy
using
the
headphones
for
very
long
amount
of
time
out
of
all
my
blu
tooth
headphones
love
these
the
best
so
far
the
sound
quality
is
awesome
easy
to
get
started
and
battery
life
is
wonderful
little
pricey,
but
they
say
you
get
what
you
pay
for
also
found
memory
foams
that
fit
and
they
took
it
over
the
top
sound
was
excellent
unfortunately,
that's
not
enough
mic
quality
is
just
bad
for
this
price
point
controls
are
okay
at
best
range
did
not
get
anywhere
near
what
they
claimed
no
app
or
anyway
to
control
the
buds
was
disappointing
really
liked
them
lot
for
music
and
the
fit
and
battery
was
disappointed
overall
for
what
paid
for
them
the
battery
life
on
these
are
unbelievable
in
comparison
to
other
products
travel
frequently
and
these
are
my
favorite
buds
the
sound
quality
is
solid
but
not
the
best
have
heard
the
noise
isolation
is
great
haven't
taken
many
calls
but
they
seem
to
work
fine
bought
these
to
replace
my
mifo
o0
would
have
to
say
these
sound
better
they
connect
faster
and
more
seemlessbut
the
battery
life
on
the
buds
only
is
not
0hrs
bought
these
specifically
for
the
longer
runtime
its
more
like
0hrs
have
not
tested
the
supposed
0hr
recharge
capability
of
the
case
as
of
right
now
doubt
it
also
the
connection
range
is
not
as
good
as
the
mifo
o0
the
mifo
o0
initial
connecting
was
horrible,
once
connected
the
range
was
greatif
you
are
looking
for
battery
life
these
are
not
it
these
earbuds
started
out
great
the
first
two
days
used
them
the
battery
lasted
hours
at
moderate
volume
level
on
the
third
day
the
right
earbud
battery
would
die
after
hours
while
the
left
earbud
maintained
its
0+hour
life
hope
that
it
was
just
dud
the
sound
quality
is
on
par
with
my
jabra
elite
0t's
they
need
to
add
the
ability
to
connect
to
two
devices
at
the
same
time
that
and
increased
quality
control
and
these
are
star
product
this
is
great
product
that
provides
clear
and
consistent
audio
connection
and
sound
in
small
device
the
battery
life
is
unmatched
however,
it
was
hard
to
stay
put
in
my
small
ears
and
kept
falling
out,
so
had
to
return
them,
but
that
might
not
be
the
case
with
other
ears
sound
quality
is
great
compared
to
jabra
elites,
this
has
great
bass
definitely
better
at
listening
to
music
can
use
one
ear
piece
at
time
battery
life
is
awesome
can't
find
any
foam
ear
tips
at
fit
though
the
jabras
have
much
better
call
quality,
but
other
than
that,
the
mavins
win
these
have
great
sound
and
battery
life
the
charging
case
is
very
nice
ear
buds
are
very
comfortable
like
the
fact
that
either
one
of
the
buds
can
be
the
master/main
control
not
like
my
jabra
0t
only
problem
is
bluetooth
connecting
on
devices
but
once
you
are
connected,
the
range
is
awesome
call
quality
is
clear
on
both
end
it
would
be
great
if
mavin
had
an
app
in
the
app
stores
bottom
line,
these
are
go
for
the
price
perfect
earbuds
no
complaints
one
of
my
favorite
actually
my
favorite
earbuds
everything
was
amazing
until
lost
one
of
the
earbuds
after
that
they
did
not
work
the
same
the
one
left
needs
the
other
to
work
properly
the
other
one
these
headphones
only
come
with
few
ear
tips
so
your
choices
for
good
fit
are
limited
sound
is
pretty
good
do
not
buy
these
for
the
range
of
feet
because
that
is
totally
lie
tested
these
and
they
would
always
start
cutting
out
after
feet
talk
quality
is
why
returned
them
my
friends
all
said
when
tested
them
with
call
said
that
was
cutting
in
and
out
so
for
i'm
sending
these
back
use
these
to
do
gardening
works
good
distance
away
from
my
phone
have
lost
connection/
choppy
connection
few
times
while
my
phone
was
in
my
pocket
but
overall
worth
the
price
headphones
are
pretty
good
for
the
price,
but
they
fall
out
of
the
ear
fair
amount
and
this
basically
ruined
my
purchase
turned
my
head
to
look
at
traffic
and
my
right
earbud
fell
out
and
got
crushed
so
now
have
one
earbud
which
is,
ahem,
less
than
ideal
messaged
mavin
about
whether
it's
possible
to
get
replacement
for
one
bud
even
if
have
to
pay
for
it,
but
haven't
heard
back
sound
quality
seems
solid,
noise
cancellation
is
good
and
the
battery
life
is
excellent
the
case
however
is
extremely
flimsy
and
the
headphone
controls
are
big
uncomfortable
to
use
as
you're
pushing
the
earphone
into
your
ear
essentiallyalso
bit
annoying
that
it's
priding
itself
on
its
bluetooth
capabilities
but
the
headphones
are
charged
with
micro
usb
and
not
usb
i'm
really
impressed
by
the
sound
quality
when
i'm
listening
to
music
which
captures
my
majority
of
use
the
mic
and
the
noise
cancellation
aspect
have
some
room
for
improvement
when
i'm
using
the
bluetooth
to
make
calls
the
other
party
can
identify
drastic
drop
in
the
audio
quality
during
the
phone
conversation
if
mavin
can
improve
the
mic
that
would
be
nice
needed
improvement
these
are
awesome
been
using
for
more
than
month
fast
charge,
long
battery
life,
great
quality
audio,
and
if
you
need
it
loud,
they
can
be
super
loud
will
probably
buy
again
just
because
trust
these
now
more
than
other
wireless
earphones
i've
tried
use
these
constantly
at
the
gym
and
for
travel
even
for
sleep
super
great
sound
bass,
long
&
free
distance
as
decribed,
long
battery
to
enjoy
listening
your
music,
light
&
comfortablelastly,
just
buy
without
regret
swear
it's
worth
have
pair
of
sony
around
the
neck
style
earbuds,
these
mavin
buds
sound
almost
as
good,
battery
lasts
almost
as
long,
the
range
is
twice
as
far,
as
no
annoying
wires
these
will
be
hard
to
beat
not
as
comfortable
as
hoped
does
not
have
the
distance
it
claims
to
have
only
get
about
ft
on
clear
path
and
lot
less
indoors
my
husband
likes
to
watch
movies
at
night
in
the
bedroom
don't
now,
he
can
watch
as
late
as
he
likes
without
disturbing
me
and,
he
says
they
are
very
comfortable,
with
great
sound
this
one
is
best
of
the
best
they're
great
nice
but
the
battery
is
at
best
ok
giving
these
star
review
although
sonically
and
form
factor
wise
these
are
great,
the
left
earbud
went
out
after
months
and
will
no
longer
pair
wish
it
didn
happen
as
really
like
these
this
product
started
out
great
but
months
later
one
of
the
headphones
doesn't
work
and
you
can't
get
hold
of
anyone
from
the
company
to
address
the
problem
pretty
good
but
its
hard
to
get
buds
to
stay
in
ear
could
be
lil
louder
it
is
not
expensive
and
think
it
has
very
good
quality
better
than
many
last
long
time
between
charges,
absolutely
noise
canceling
,
and
sound
quality
is
superb
have
this
by
two
mont,
and
work
perfetly,
great
sound,
dont
have
lag,
and
the
batery
is
very
long
like
this
design
and
colorand
about
sound
quality,
it
is
so
goodand
have
never
experienced
any
disconnection
of
bluetoothi
like
mavin
air
like
the
quality
of
sound
and
the
loudness
no
dislike
maybe
the
jail
in
the
earbud
could
be
little
softer,
but
that's
reaching
impossible
to
pair
left
side
only
could
pair
right
so
not
sure
how
these
would
sound,
too
frustrating
the
left
one
not
work
and
the
customer
support
for
the
company
not
answerand
have
0year
warranty
and
its
not
pering
cheap
for
having
aac
and
aptx
resulting
in
low
latency
connections,
decent
sound
quality,
overall
very
good
pair
of
earbuds
for
the
price
very
good
design
and
sound
love
the
red
color
and
the
fact
that
they
work
with
just
one
earbud
incredible
bluetooth
range
and
clarity
at
high
volume
range
is
not
that
far
like
ad
left
earbud
already
broken,
not
working
have
tried
several
earbuds
and
these
are
better
than
the
airpods
crisp,
nice
bass
sound
get
louder
than
all
the
rest
have
tried
worth
every
penny
great
product
i've
had
pair
for
over
year
and
just
bought
new
one
for
my
mother
since
it's
so
easy
to
use
and
very
reliable
like
the
range
and
battery
life
the
product
has
worked
flawlessly
for
me
the
battery
has
lasted
the
full
time
descpripted
and
the
sound
quality
is
the
best
i've
ever
owned
not
happy
with
the
sound
and
the
way
it
feel
to
my
ears
the
item
was
sent
used
and
unbowed
like
long
battery
life
very
long
play
time
and
great
wifi
distance
the
sound
is
fantastic
