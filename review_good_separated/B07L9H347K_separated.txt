very
nice
charger,
works
very
well
blue
led
looks
sharp,
however
maybe
an
on/off
switch
for
the
led
would
give
people
the
option
to
turn
it
off
could
see
it
being
distracting
if
it
was
in
line
of
sight
watching
tv
in
darker
roomthe
fact
that
it
works
with
little
dongle
instead
of
the
charger
having
male
plug
to
line
up
with
the
controller
port
makes
it
simple
and
worry
free
ve
never
been
fan
of
the
ones
without
dongles
my
favourite
charger
is
still
the
old
intec
ps3
wireless
charge
pad
still
use
them
todayi
highly
recommend
this
charger,
the
fact
that
it
comes
with
dongles
is
great
bonus
too
this
is
very
nice
charging
dock
my
only
gripe
is
the
little
dongles
that
plug
into
the
controller
mini
usb
could
get
easily
lost
comes
with
they
are
very
small
seems
to
work
great,
the
charging
base
has
blue
led
light
that
circles
around
the
bottom
and
base
plugs
into
usb
port
kind
of
annoying
like:
magnetic
dongles
super
easy
to
use
no
need
to
line
up
the
controller
port
to
the
microusb
tip
and
push
in
on
charging
stand
anymore
had
the
charging
tip
on
previous
stand
bent,
broken
and
the
charging
port
on
the
ds4
scratched
like
someone
took
screwdriver
to
it
because
the
kids
kept
jamming
the
controller
in
before
realising
it
was
not
lined
up
dislike:
this
is
very
minor
point
the
dongles
that
came
with
the
charging
stand
are
small
and
prone
to
get
lost
would
be
nice
if
the
manufacturer
could
have
designed
slot
in
the
base
so
the
spare
dongles
could
be
stored
there
for
this
price
i'm
not
going
to
say
you
won't
find
magnetic
dock
unlike
this
non
magnetic
one
works
just
fine
though,
only
issue
is
that
the
led
strip
running
around
the
base
is
wayyy
tooo
bright
for
dark
rooms,
or
when
going
to
bed,
if
this
is
in
your
bedroom
have
to
turn
it
off
this
is
the
worst
product
from
china
bought
on
amazon
the
charger
work
time
and
after
nada
just
after
the
refund
time
pass
email
them
times
and
they
dont
answer
at
all
they
litteraly
dont
care
to
answer
mei
repost
dont
buy
this
dont
buy
this
works
as
expected
makes
it
lot
easier
to
charge
the
ps4
controllers
rather
than
trying
to
plug
them
in
like
on
other
chargers
it
also
nice
they
give
you
dongles
still
working
after
month
or
so
no
issues
controller
seats
bit
awkwardly
your
cats
can
tip
the
controllers
off,
but
that
is
your
problem,
not

great
product
way
more

tiny

highly
recommended
easy

great
price
exactly
what
he
wanted
was
surprised
it
was
lower
price
than
expected
unfortunately
within
week
of
the
return
window
closing
it
stopped
actually
charging
the
lights
change
color
like
they
are
charging
but
when
you
take
them
off
after
charging
all
night
they
last
for
about
10
minutes
thought
would
suck
but
it
really
useful
it
feel
like
it
charges
your
remotes
faster
work
better
then
others
have
tried
muy
bueno
love
it
