this
review
is
now
several
months
in
to
my
ownership
of
these
earbudsi
purchased
these
due
to
the
perceived
good
name
of
motorola
have
found
difficulties
with
the
product
none
of
which
are
solvable
with
the
limited
on
line
help
there
is
no
possibility
of
an
update
so
am
left
with
what
came
in
the
packetthe
tubular
black
power
pack
the
two
buds
are
carried
in
looks
good,
the
tiny
buds
look
terrific
and
no,
that's
it
there's
nothing
else
the
limited
amount
of
play
time,
bit
less
than
hours,
is
not
the
worst
of
the
problems
chiefly
it
is
that
only
on
rare
occasions
do
both
ear
buds
power
up
and
connect
with
my
phone
in
stereo
or
even
mono
most
of
the
time
the
'tap'
to
attach
the
ear
bud
will
continue
to
use
singular
because
that
is
all
can
often
get
to
work
occasionally
it's
the
right,
occasionally
it's
the
left
leaves
me
standing
there
feeling
stupid
whilst
tap,
tap
and
tap
again
at
the
unresponsive
ear
bud
eventually
one
deigns
to
connect
to
my
phone
the
sound
is
alright
yes
know
damning
with
faint
praise
only
ever
seem
to
listen
to
audio
books
at
night
in
bed
so
it's
okay
when
roll
over
and
switch
the
single
working
bud
to
the
ear
that's
not
against
my
pillow
there
going
trying
to
be
nice
and
positive
but
really
these
were
waste
of
money
i'd
love
to
be
able
to
tell
you
how
wellor
unwell
they
were
making
or
receiving
calls
but
haven't
clue
as
their
functioning
is
too
irregular
to
use
to
make
or
receive
phone
call
wholeheartedly
do
not
recommend
these
to
anyonei
can't
give
zero
stars
and
whilst
say
they
look
terrific
they
really
do
that
gives
false
impression
that
they
may
be
terrific
which
they
are
noti
didn't
return
them
as
figured
nothing
was
really
wrong
with
it
it
was
just
poorly
performing
product
it
has
really
put
me
off
the
brand
el
diseño
es
bastante
discreto
elegante,
se
emparejan
con
tu
smartphone
super
fácil
puedes
utilizarlos
de
manera
independiente
ambos
traen
micrófono
pero
si
traes
ambos
solamente
toma
el
micrófono
del
audífono
derecho,
se
cargan
bastante
rápido
tanto
la
batería
como
los
audífonos
aproximadamente
la
carga
te
dura
unas
horas
de
uso
constante
con
la
batería
puedes
cargarlos
al
completo
dos
veces
mas,
lo
único
malo
es
que
su
alcance
no
es
tan
grande
unos
metros,
pero
para
salir
correr
no
se
caen,
tienen
buen
agarre
vienen
juegos
de
gomas
que
aíslan
bastante
bien
el
sonido
buena
batería
en
el
estuche
hasta
recargas,
tiene
control
táctil
en
ambos
auriculares,
de
gran
ayuda
para
contestar,
colgar,
pausar
continuar
música,
lo
mismo
con
las
películas
importante
no
presentan
retazo
en
netflix
ni
amazon
prime
como
ves
la
imagen
escuchas
el
audio
sin
desfaz
recomendado,
son
prácticos,
su
batería
se
guarda
donde
sea,
el
material
es
de
calidad
el
sonido
es
fuerte
gracias
que
se
acomodan
bien
en
el
oido
por
sus
"gomitas"
los
audífonos
son
lo
que
esperaba
en
cuanto
dimensiones
materiales,
pero
al
principio
tuve
problemas
para
reproducir
contenido,
se
cortaba
demasiado
la
señal,
pero
pasando
un
par
de
días
se
arregló
están
preciosos,
pero
se
me
caen
de
las
orejas,
entonces
no
sé
que
tan
buena
elección
hayan
sido
para
mí
excelente
producto

agrada

maravilloso

great
little
set
of
earbuds,
looks
stunning
for
the
price
and
has
great
ergonomics,
both
in
the
carrying
case,
which
will
fit
basically
anywhere,
and
in
the
buds
while
in
the
ears
both
units
work
independently
they
both
have
microphones
built
in
and
will
automatically
sync
if
powered
up
in
succession,
even
if
the
first
one
is
already
connected
to
device
when
both
powered
up
and
connected,
powering
down
one
will
power
down
the
other
too
command
button
is
touch
sensitive
and
perfectly
placed
at
the
top
of
the
unit,
sensitivity
is
little
on
the
heavy
side
but
it
prevents
unintentional
activations
carrying
case
has
magnetic
tips
so
the
buds
will
be
secured
by
the
magnets
with
very
tight
fit
the
sound
output
is
adequate
for
the
price
point
but
nothing
to
write
home
about,
best
use
is
definitely
phone
conversations

of
january
0th,
the
left
earbud
has
now
stopped
working,
it
powers
on
but
no
audio,
super
disappointedbe
cautious,
maybe
got
bad
set
so
disappointedi
have
always
liked
motorola
and
in
the
past
they
have
been
really
innovative,
but
maybe
not
get
the
credit
they
deserve
now
days
had
decided
to
get
pair
of
true
wireless
blue
tooth
headphones,
shopped
around
on
ebay
and
amazon
and
bestbuy
of
course
some
were
way
too
expensive,
too
cheap,
to
big
etc
stumbled
on
the
motorola
verve
and
knew
that
liked
motorola
so
decided
to
give
them
shot,
for
it
was
worth
the
risk
love
these,
the
clean
round
shape
stays
in
place
while
run,
it
pairs
very
easily,
the
construction
seems
to
be
lightweight
metal,
the
tubular
charging/storage
case
is
sleek
and
fits
into
my
pocket
or
messenger
bag
nice
and
compact
would
highly
recommend
these
they
are
compatible
with
my
motorola
phone
like
the
app
that
comes
with
them
the
locator
feature
is
very
helpful
the
sound
quality
is
good
and
its
easy
to
answer
my
calls
with
them
the
microphone
works
well
too
would
recommend
them
for
the
convenience
and
the
value
for
the
money
these
headphones
sound
really
tinny
and
lack
mid
range
and
low
end
terribly
they
also
randomly
turn
on
by
themselves
and
connect
to
the
most
recent
device
in
my
case,
my
cell
phone
this
causes
me
to
miss
phone
calls,
etc
very
annoying
i've
found
no
solution
to
this
you
can
get
much
better
chinese
ear
buds
for
less
than
half
the
price
of
these
very
disappointing
for
company
like
motorola
these
really
suck
and
should
cost
no
more
than
dollars
at
most
tried
everything
with
these
earbud
things
but
everyone
tried
to
talk
with
could
not
hear
me
and
had
to
use
speaker
phone,
which
really
do
not
like
to
do
and
then
to
make
it
worse
there
is
window
after
which
you
cannot
return
them
really
unhappy
pros:0
clean
and
professional
look0
long
battery
life
for
the
size
surpass
my
reasonable
expectations0
they
work
individually,
my
preferred
method
only
use
one
at
time
is
especially
useful
if
were
to
loose
one0
range,
0+
with
line
of
sight0
easy
to
set
up,
atleast
for
me0
low
price,
if
they
breakdown
or
get
lost
is
something
you
could
easily
replace
atleast,
compare
to
otherscons:0
ruber
piece
that
goes
in
your
ear
falls
off
easily
it
hasn't
occurred
in
my
ear,
but
almost
everytime
clean
it0
if
you're
into
listening
music
don't
have
high
expectations
is
good
for
casual
user
and
for
listening
to
podcasts0
phone
calls
suck
usable
indoors,
not
outside
for
mefor
$0
definitely
recommend
love
the
look
and
individual
functionality
of
the
earbuds
personally
don't
care
for
the
cons,
is
not
like
broke
my
budget
to
buy
these
this
are
my
personal
opinion
based
on
hours
of
heavy
use
wow
am
very
impressed
wanted
to
wait
to
review
and
use
these
several
times
have
the
nature
of
my
listening
is
typically
ear,
moving
around
big
space
with
lots
of
walls
with
phone
stationary
the
reception
is
very
very
good
they
reconnect
every
single
time
that
has
been
my
biggest
complaint
with
other
brands
have
been
burned
with
others
that
never
connect
also,
the
buttons
are
touch
sensitive
but
they
do
not
do
very
many
things
which
is
nice
they
are
simple
and
comfortable
the
battery
life
is
good
have
almost
lost
the
buds
because
they
are
small
so
put
them
back
into
the
holder
every
time
the
holder
is
very
small
so
can
carry
it
in
my
pocket
even
added
clip
only
issue
is
that,
when
using
on
phone
calls,
recipients
are
say
they
are
having
difficult
time
hearing
hearing
me
besides
that,
am
able
to
listen
to
music
as
advertised
and
hear
recipients
very
well
the
battery
notification
is
rather
annoying,
the
touch
function
leaves
lot
to
be
desired,
you
practically
have
to
smash
it
into
your
ear
to
register
anything,
but
worst
of
all
is
that
the
audio
keeps
disconnecting
from
one
another
but
the
they're
both
still
in
the
correct
positioni've
noticed
something
more
annoying
than
anything
else
it
will
randomly
connect
from
the
charger,
what
kind
of
idiot
let
that
pass
discreet
and
minimalist,
just
the
way
like
things
sounds
great
battery
could
last
little
longer
and
don't
care
for
the,
"hello
moto"
soundfile
that
plays
every
single
time
they
sync
to
your
bluetooth,
however,
solid
purchase
that's
good
watched
two
movies
with
thisthe
battery
life
is
so
good
sounds
quality
is
really
good
love
that
❤
i've
waited
to
write
this
review
have
had
pairs
of
these
earbuds
in
the
last
0⁄0
months
the
first
pair
one
of
the
earbuds
wouldn't
charge
no
big
deal
well
the
0nd
pair
both
charged
but
had
other
problems
with
these
they
seem
like
the
wouldn't
hold
charge
very
long
had
connectivity
issues
with
the
bluetooth
couldn't
get
them
to
hook
up
with
my
desktop
computer
at
all
and
sometimes
after
just
hook
themput
to
with
device
they
would
shut
off
and
disconnect
never
had
this
problem
with
the
first
set
from
my
experience
with
these
earbuds
they
are
complete
garbage
like
others
are
reporting
it's
crap
shoot
to
get
these
to
connect
properly
and
sync
up
for
stereo
listening,
individually
they
work
fine
these
are
more
pair
of
mono
buds
rather
than
stereo
earbuds
returning
for
something
that
works
this
device
is
awesome
the
battery
on
these
mini
ear
pieces
even
outlast
my
cell
phone
lgv0
work
in
hospital
and
can
only
use
one
earned
because
have
to
be
able
to
hear
overhead
pages
one
earbud
is
enough
for
me
you
wont
regret
it
once
you
out
your
hands
on
it
you
can
not
live
without
,
super
easy
to
pair
and
fits
almost
everywheredue
to
the
size
does
great
job
on
noice
cancelation
hated
them
onlyvgave
it
stars
because
of
the
comfort
and
design
you
can
only
use
one
bud
at
time
had
known
it
wasn't
stereo
sound
would
have
passed
everyone
says
sound
far
away
when
use
them
and
you
have
to
sync
the
ear
buds
separately
for
them
to
work
should
have
returned
sound
quality
is
quite
good,
but
bluetooth
connectiom
reaches
0ft
if
there
is
nothing
in
the
way
and
microphone
quality
is
poor
is
hard
to
be
heard
during
calls
ordered
june
0th,
not
working
as
of
september
left
one
stopped
working
about
so
weeks
prior
and
the
right
just
gave
out

not
buy
only
got
to
use
them
twice
before
they
became
unpaired
with
each
other
now
only
can

worthless
not
worth
the
$0
wasted
la

they
are
sticking
me
with
$0
restocking
feeit
wasn't
my
fault

nice
and
compact
connecting
is
good
just
staying
connected
and
always
cutting
out
can't
get
far
from
the
phone
and
they
cut
out
don't
try
walking
somewhere
or
running
they
cut
off
with
just
little
wind
wish
they
where
better
love
motorola
products
but
these
wish
would
have
gotten
something
different
very
nice
earbuds,
except
this
0a
my
second
pair
and
the
r0ght
headphone

an
sounded
but
after
month
one
of
them
stopped
working
completely
why
don
know
not
really
happy
with
this
product
it
could
be
better
with
noise
cancelation
and
better
grip
as
they
fall
off
easily
and
aren
the
most
confortable
good
for
the
price
handy
feature
such
as
tap
to
pause,
double
tap
to
skip
track,
hold
press
to
power
off
liked
the
sound
they
would
keep
popping
out
of
my
ear
while
was
working
while
on
the
phone,
the
sound
quality
wasn't
great;
sounded
muffled
im
sensitive
having
plugs
in
my
ears
so
couldn
wear
them
for
long
period
idk
what
people
didn't
like
bout

properly
they
are
comfortable
and

and
they
work
perfectly
together
motorola

they
are
comfortable
and
have
great
sound
nice
compact
package
and
very
easy
to
pair
with
your
device
well
worth
the
money
the

it
when
am
working
out
to
listening
to
music
and
when
