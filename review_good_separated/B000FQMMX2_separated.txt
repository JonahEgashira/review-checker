these
back
from
japan
and
when
ran
out,
was
very
pleased
to
see
you
can
get
them
through
amazon!
if
you
haven't
used
these
before,
each
sachet
type
is
aligned
with
different
japanese
onsen
natural
hotspring,
and
by
adding
it
to
your
bath,
it's
supposed
to
make
your
water
have
the
same
mineral
content,
and
thus
the
same
healing/relaxing
properties.
each
sachet
type
has
different
scent.these
are
well
worth
getting
if
you
want
to
try
to
recreate
an
onsen
experience
at
home,
or
if
you
just
want
to
bring
little
bit
of
japan
to
your
bath
time.bonus:
if
you're
interested
in
what
the
writing
on
the
box
says,
download
the
google
translate
app
which
has
photo
mode.
the
app
will
translate
any
text
in
photo.
this
item
arrived
earlier
than
the
projected
delivery
date
for
me,
live
in
the
uk.
absolutely
lovely
product.
the
box
looks
very
cute
on
my
shelf
and
the
individual
packets
are
very
novel,
easy
to
open.
the
scents
are
not
overwhelming
but
they
are
strong
enough
to
make
the
whole
bathroom
smell
wonderful.
each
salt
changes
the
colour
of
the
bath
water
and
does
not
feel
as
strong/abrasive/chemical-ish
as
other
bath
salts
i've
tried
from
local
drug
stores
boots,
tk
maxx
and
superdrug,
again,
i'm
in
the
uk
would
recommend
this
box
as
you
get
an
assortment
of
"flavours"
at
decent
price.
there
is
very
good
amount
of
salt
in
each
packet
and
it's
nice
having
four
types
to
choose
from.
love
it!
:
love
this
box
of
hot
spring
bath
salt
from
japan!
first
of
all
the
seller
packed
it
so
nicely,
the
box
was
fully
protected
so
wasn
damaged
via
transit
have
to
say
this
is
one
cute
seller!
have
never
received
my
purchase
in
such
beautiful
packaging
before!this
box
comes
with
kinds
of
bath
salt,
love
the
smell
of
it
all!
really
helped
with
relaxation
and
get
rid
of
tiredness
on
my
back!i
love
japan!
can
really
visit
now
due
to
the
pandemic!
at
least
feel
like
have
brought
some
hot
spring
home
❤
these
were
surprisingly
good
,
just
bought
on
whim
as
wanted
some
more
bathing
products
but
have
enjoyed
using
them.
there
is
no
english
on
any
of
the
packaging
so
don't
now
exactly
what
scents
they
are
,
but
each
one
i've
used
has
been
great
so
far.
not
particularity
strong
but
gives
the
water
/bathroom
subtle
aroma.
they
also
changed
the
waters
colour
too
which
is
also
bonus.
love
the
packaging
too
and
for
the
amount
you
get,
really
good
price
i'd
say
love
these!
used
to
use
similar
product
whilst
living
in
japan
so
bathing
in
these
salts
took
me
right
back
there.
during
these
times
where
we
can't
travel
it's
nice
to
"transport
yourself"
to
other
places.
the
packaging
is
lovely.recommend!
these
have
very
pleasant
smell,
its
not
overly
powerful
but
it
has
nice
hint.you
only
need
one
sachet
to
fill
the
tub,
thought
it
would
just
change
the
colour
of
the
water
but
it
has
cloudy
look,
as
in
you
dont
see
your
body
parts
once
youre
in..i
dont
like
using
bathbombs
or
bubbles
so
this
was
really
refreshing.
for
decent
amount
of
sachets
you
get
equals
to
2-3
lush
bath
bombs!

much
more

they
come
in

and
the
smell
of
each
kind
is
great.
love
them!
natürlich
ist
der
preis
etwas
hoch
angesetzt
aufgrund
des
imports.es
gibt
verschiedene
sorten,
davon
waren
sehr
blumig
und
die
anderen
mehr
medizinisch.die
bluminge
variante
war
sehr
intensiv,
sogar
zu
intensiv
für
mich.
das
kenne
ich
nicht
so
von
japanischen
badesalz
gerüchen
und
hat
mich
demnach
sehr
gestört.
die
medizinische
variante
wer
sehr
angenehm
und
erinnerte
mich
eher
an
kräuter.im
großen
und
ganzen
ein
versuch
wert.
aber
nochmal
werde
ich
es
nicht
kaufen.
diese
bäder
sind
unglaublich
toll.
anders
als
in
europa
sind
diese
bäderkeine
schaumbäder
sonderen
eher
für
entspannung,
haut
und
gelenke.es
sind
varianten
enthalten
aus
unterschiedlichen
quellen
aus
japan.von
pienen
bis
hin
zu
blumigen
düften
und
grüntee.die
unterschiedlichen
bäder
sind
einmal
für
gelenke
und
muskelnwiederum
für
haut
und
entspannung
oder
gar
beides.die
dürfte
sind
alle
sehr
angenehm
und
erinnern
teilweise
wirklich
an
die
onsenin
japan.ich
kann
sie
wirklich
nur
empfehlen
nach
extrem
stressigen
tagen
oderwenn
man
gesundheitlich
angeschlagen
ist
helfen
teilweise
die
ätherischen
düfteund
natürlich
das
warme
wasser
zum
entspannen.wenn
die
packung
alle
ist
werde
ich
sicherlich
eine
neue
nachbestellen
:
it
takes
little
longer
to
receive
the
product
because
the
product
was
shipped
directly
from
japan.
there
were
four
colors:
green,
purple,
red
and
blue.
think
different
colors
were
for
different
uses.
purple
may
be
for
hydration,
red
may
be
for
soothing
neck
and
waist
pain,
green
may
be
for
relieving
your
fatigue
and
blue
may
be
for
warming
your
body
and
nerves.
the
powder
smells
really
good.
the
bath
color
will
match
the
packet's
color.
think
it's
nice
product
and
will
order
again.
although
they
seem
okay.
just
think
that
the
other
powders
made
from
actual
japan
are
what
you
might
be
looking
for.
these
still
make
the
skin
feel
nice
as
they
have
think,
bentoline
clay
in
them.
which
absorbs
toxins
from
the
body.
they
make
great
present
for
those
who
want
something
to
use
while
relaxing
in
the
tub.
enjoyed
using
them.
lieferung
wie
angekündigt.
tolles
produkt.
dafür
dass
es
aus
japan
kommt
relativ
schnell
da.
ich
liebe
japanische
produkte,
leider
ist
dieser
badezusatz
in
china
hergestellt.
habe
noch
nicht
alles
ausprobiert,
erst
den
grünen
fichtennadeln
glaube
ich,
riecht
überhaupt
nicht
künstlich.
bin
bis
jetzt
zufrieden.
ich
habe
keine
ahnung,
was
auf
der
verpackung
steht
und
welchen
duft
ich
jeweils
im
einsatz
hatte,
doch
die
wirkung
bzw.
das
erlebnis
war
und
ist
toll!kein
schaum
sondern
leichte
ein-
bzw.
verfärbung
des
wassers
mit
tollen
düften,
wodurch
dann
mit
dem
warmen
wasser
die
entspannung
kommt.
ob
es
mehr
als
nur
duften
kann,
vermag
ich
nicht
beurteilen
zu
können;
mir
und
meiner
entspannung
plus
haut
hat
es
gut
getan.
the
first
time
bought
this
product
in
toyo.
as
happy
to
see
it
being
offer
through
amazon.
the
seller
responds
right
away.
good
packing.
the
onsen
salts
have
great
smell
and
leave
the
skin
soft.
will
definiteley
keep
buying
this
product
in
the
future.
ein
badepulver,
das
sich
schnell
und
vollständig
auflöst.es
gibt
vier
verschiedene
farben,
die
aber
nicht
bis
auf
das
grüne
päckchen
mit
der
farbe
der
verpackung
übereinstimmen
müssen.
so
beinhaltet
das
lila-päckchen
ein
knallrotes
badepulver.ich
habe
selber
für
mich
festgestellt,
dass
mir
die
hälfte
des
pulver
für
ein
angenehmes
badegefühl
reicht.es
bildet
sich
kein
schaum
und
das
wasser
wird
auch
nicht
trüb.ich
selber
bin
gegeistert
und
würde
es
immer
wieder
kaufen.
mir
wurde
das
badesalz
von
einem
japanischen
freund
empfohlen
und
gleich
zum
testen
gegeben.
es
ist
einfach
fantastisch!
kein
vergleich
zu
gewöhnlichen
badesalzen
didn't
think
that
such
small
amount
of
product
could
do
so
much,
but
it
really
made
for
wonderful
bath
experience.
feel
like
get
to
enjoy
little
bit
of
japan!
great
product!
like
it
purchased
this
as
gift
and
have
heard
amazing
things
about
this.
would
purchase
this
product
again.

than
expected.
and
the
product
is
great.
very
nice!!
wer
gerne
ein
bad
nimmt
und
mal
was
neues
ausprobieren
will
,
dem
wird
es
gefallen.

good
was
really
hopeful
that
this
was
going
to
be
nice,
high
quality
japanese
onsen
type
experience.
what
got
smelled,
looked
and
felt
like
laundry
detergent.
don't
know
how
else
to
describe
it.
the
scent
was
very
strong
and
overpowering,
exactly
like
the
scents
in
some
detergent.
it
made
me
kind
of
itchy,
but
maybe
that
was
because
couldn't
thinking
about
anything
else
besides
how
felt
like
was
sitting
in
the
washing
machine!
upon
further
inspection
of
the
box,
see
"made
in
china"
right
on
the
box.
it's
so
confusing
because
the
packaging
is
all
in
japanese,
so
why
then
is
it
made
in
china?
i'm
going
to
try
and
return
this
and
purchase
what
hope
will
be
real
japanese
product.
i'm
really
disappointed
:
these
do
not
smell
that
good,
very
chemically.
also,
they
are
not
japanese,
they're
made
in
china
and
marketed
as
japanese.
got
duped
by
the
title
and
won't
be
buying
again.bought
this
because
thought
it
would
resemble
actual
japanese
bath
tablets,
like
the
ones
that
are
sold
in
every
drug
store
in
japan.
not
the
case.
literally
raving.
consider
myself
bit
of
bath
junkie
and
can
honestly
say
i'm
so
impressed.
have
used
epsom
salt,
essential
oils,
and
etc
in
my
bathes
before
but
none
have
left
my
skin
so
soft.
it
pained
me
to
drag
myself
from
the
tub.
have
only
used
one
pink
and
actually
didn't
like
the
smell
as
much
as
i'd
hoped
but
it
was
so
light
and
airy
that
it
barely
mattered.
now
that
my
skin
has
meshed
with
it,
it
smells
amazing.
kept
one
hand
consistently
out
of
the
bayh
and
one
in
to
test
if
the
packet
did
anything
and
can
honestly
say
especially
considering
how
pruned
up
my
hand
had
become
that
did
not
expect
to
see
difference.
was
wrong.
it's
like
shaving
your
legs
and
rubbing
them
together
for
that
first
time
when
they're
dry.
the
water
had
turned
almost
the
density
and
color
of
milk
cleopatra?
is
that
you?
and
couldn't
see
my
leg
when
it
was
under
water
hardly/if
at
all.
for
the
price
of
less
than
$1
packet?
honestly.
why
are
you
even
still
reading
this?
buy
it.
gave
these
out
to
my
coworkers
as
way
to
relieve
stress,
as
we
work
in
cov19
testing
center.
i've
tried
the
red
and
white
printed
packet.
it
smelled
"pink",
like
it
did
come
from
some
mysterious
pink
flowers.
it
was
milky,
which
wanted,
but
didn't
expect.
the
hotter
the
water,
the
better
it
felt.
nothing
like
opening
up
all
your
pours,
doing
little
sweating,
and
getting
all
the
blood
flowing!
perfect
before
bed.
can't
wait
to
try
the
purple
packet,
which
could
be
wisteria
scented,
according
to
the
illustrations.
take
hot,
relaxing
bath
with
these,
they're
fun
and
different.
smelly!looks
like
it
is
made
by
chemicals
which
means
it
will
only
intoxicate
you
instead
of
detoxicate!you
can
feel
it
by
the
smells
colors
and
feel.real
hot
spring
do
not
smell,
colored
and
feels
like
it
at
all.if
it
was
all
100%
natural
they
were
highlighting
it
on
the
box
with
the
ingredients
believe
me!so
the
summery
of
this
product
is:don't
buy
it!
it's
fraud!
there
is
so
much
can
say
about
this
product.
am
absolutely
in
love
with
it
need
to
buy
more
soon.
since
have
run
out
every
bath
feels
boring.
they
smell
so
amazing,
my
favorite
though
are
the
milky
ones.
they
would
leave
not
just
my
skin
but
my
whole
house
smelling
great.
they
left
my
skin
soft
and
relaxing
easy.
am
so
glad
bought
them.
am
mom
of
so
at
the
end
of
the
day
need
my
relaxing
bath
and
glass
of
wine.
am
also
on
budget
so
can't
afford
bath
bombs,
this
is
just
as
great
though
in
my
opinion.
there
are
few
options
on
amazon
for
japanese
bath
salts/powders,
i'd
recommend
making
sure
this
is
the
one
you
purchase.
it
is
the
only
option
that
has
all
scents
with
milky
blend,
what
that
means
is
the
other
options
will
have
different
scents
but
of
the
20
or
so
they
provide
you
with
maybe
3-5
of
which
will
have
milky
blend.
this
one
smells
great
and
provides
all
blends
with
milky
bath.
like
these
bath
salts,
but
really
love
the
tabino
yado
springs
from
japan
much
better
these
are
from
china.
they
are
less
expensive
which
is
plus.
would
order
then
again.
excellent
japanese

every
thing
you
don't
want
on
you!!thanks
japanremember
to
take
directions
from
amazon-what's
sent
is
in
japanese,
while
you
believe
it
came
from
japan,
you
won't
remember
what
to
do-
supposed
to
be
at
certain
temperature
&
if
you
have
blood
pressure
issue
there's
information-
brought
my
blood
pressure
way
down!
read
somewhere
when
sweat
begins
on
our
face,
time
to
get
out
or
there
is
time
limit
suggested-
you
could
be
like
me
&
just
stay
in
to
"get
my
$
worth-"
thankfully
don't
have
bp
problem,
but
again
w/o
bp
issue-i
felt
like
it
had
dropped.
also
read
supposed
to
wrap
self
in
blanket
to
sweat
&further
detoxify-
which
sounds
inviting
after-i
just
wanted
water-very
dehydrating
-or
just
wasn't
hydrated
correctly
dying
of
thirst
&
wanted
to
lie
down
immediately
after-make
bed!
but
you'll
feel
like
new
person!
so
squeaky
clean!!
absolutely
love
the
product.

the

and
the
blue
provides
an
ocean

my
package
was
falling
apart
on

but
all
the
individual
packets
were
in

say
it's
decent
and

found
in

homes.
this
is
the
3rd
time

purchased
this

i've
only
had
the
chance
to
use
one
of
these
packets
so
far.
however,
the
smell
was
very
pleasant
and
reminded
me
of
the
fancy
onsens
in
japan.
it
actually
elevated
my
mood
from
bringing
back
those
find
memories.

fan
for
sure.
the
bath
powder
smelled
great
and
made
my
skin
feel
soft
and
silky
in
the
water
and
out.
my
skin
didn't
feel
as
dry
as
it
usually
does
after
bathed.
don't
know
how
these
bath
powders
are
derived
from
onsen
hot
spring
water
in
japan,
but
it
made
me
feel
as
if
were
back
in
japan
at
the
various
onsen
locations
stated
on
the
box.
ordered
several
boxes
for
my
mother's
birthday
and
she's
been
so
happy,
feeling
as
if
she
gets
to
go
home
each
night
to
enjoy
an
onsen
at
some
exotic
place
in
japan.
it's
so
wonderful
to
have
discovered
this
great
product.
these
bath
salts
were
bought
on
whim,
but
after
looking
at
the
reviews
decided
to
get
it.
they
are
very
nice!
they
make
the
water
milky
and
sooting.
have
extremely
sensitive
skin
and
they
didn't
bother
me.
they
smell
very
lovely
in
almost
delicate
sort
of

over
all
great
product.
love
this
products.
smells
amazing
and
the
skin
after
it
is
very
soft.
bought
all
the
products
from
this
series.
sometimes
use
bath
bombs,
but
these
are
so
much
better!
they
give
the
water
such
beautiful
color
and
aroma.
they
also
are
very
moisturizing.
will
continue
to
use
and
purchase.
good
product
don't
really
care
about
how
the
box
came
in
this
condition
but
for
future
reference
other
customers
may
not
want
their
boxes
scrunched
up
and
crushed
like
said
to
me
doesn't
really
matter
as
long
as
all
of
the
actual
packages
inside
the
box
are
intact
which
they
are
bought
this
on
impulse
after
reading
some
reviews.
take
my
own
bath
time
extremely
seriously,
and
am
so
happy
that
got
this.
it
comes
with
few
varieties,
and
some
do
not
have
my
favorite
scents
but
they
are
mild
and
generally
all
pleasant.
they
also
change
the
color
of
your
bath
water
to
some
very
beautiful
colors,
but
don't
worry,
it
won't
stain
your
tub.
if
you're
considering,
stop
and
just
get
it.
if
you
like
using
bath
products
like
bath
bombs
or
epsom
salt
i'd
strongly
suggest
trying
out
these
bath
packets.
they
leave
your
skin
smooth
and
offer
the
same
type
of
relief
you
would
expect
from
muscle
ache
soak.
my
husband
hates
baths,
but
he
will
take
one
if
draw
one
up
with
one
of
the
packets
in
there.
these
are
the
best
bath
salts.
each
scent
smells
so
good.
some
of
them
turn
the
water
pretty
milky
color
and
makes
the
water
feel
so
luxurious
and
spa
like
and
feels
so
relaxing.
my
skin
always
feels
so
soft
after
use
them
and
smells
so
good
too.
they
make
great
gifts
also.

this

purchased
this
product
few
days
ago,
and
have
tried
each
of
the
four
different
powders,
so
thought
i'd
write
this
review.
so,
have
been
to
japan,
and
have
bought
bath
powders
from
the
local
stores
several
times.
while
have
never
seen
this
particular
package
of
powders
at
family
mart
or
7-eleven,
this
product
isn't
that
different
from
what
i've
had
while
there.
several
folks
are
commenting
that
this
is
chinese
product
and
not
japanese;
that
isn't
exactly
true
statement.
the
package
says
right
on
it
that
it
is
manufactured
in
china,
but
if
you
go
to
the
company's
website,
you
can
clearly
see
they
are
japanese
company
making
all
sorts
of
home
products,
including
this
one.
while
it
might
be
manufactured
in
china,
it
is
japanese
product.so,
onto
the
powders
themselves...
first
started
with
the
purple
one.
honestly
was
little
taken
back
by
how
strongly
it
smelled,
and
it
definitely
lingered
in
my
bathroom
for
hours
after
was
done.
out
of
the
scents,
to
me,
the
purple
one
is
definitely
the
most
potent.
someone
had
commented
that
the
scents
kind
of
reminded
them
of
cheap
bath
toiletries.
agree,
which
is
why
knocked
off
star.
let's
be
honest,
this
product
isn't
very
expensive,
and
when
purchased
it,
wasn't
expecting
real
onsen
experience
the
onsen's
i've
been
to
don't
have
scented
waters
at
all,
just
hot
water,
and
big
bucket
of
salt
to
scrub
yourself
with.that
being
said,
this
product
met
my
expectations.
would
suggest
that
anyone
who
buys
these
powders
to
get
your
tub
nice
and
hot,
add
packet,
and
then
just
let
it
sit
for
good
10-15
minutes
to
allow
some
of
the
strong
smell
to
dissipate.
then
soak
good
30
minutes
or
so
for
the
full
effects.the
powders
did
leave
my
skin
feeling
soft
and
slightly
scented,
but
not
too
strongly
scented.would
buy
these
again?
maybe.
other
than
the
one's
i've
tried
in
japan,
which
can't
seem
to
find
any
here
in
the
states,
haven't
tried
any
other
bath
powders,
so
plan
on
picking
up
couple
others
to
see
which
ones
prefer
most.
so,
in
short,
no
immediate
plans
to
buy
again,
but
i'm
not
ruling
it
out
either.
either
way,
they
do
make
for
nice
bath,
even
if
they
smell
on
the
cheap
side.
oh
my
lord!
gave
these
two
stars
because
they
weren't
completely
horrible.
maybe
it's
just
different
to
me,
but
the
smell
was
so
funky
to
me.
the
green
packets
are
nice,
they
have
menthol
smell
and
feel.
but
the
rest
of
the
packets
have
strong
chemical
smell
that
is
hard
to
get
rid
of.
housemates
even
commented
on
the
smell
because
it
wouldn't
go
away
for
while.
lingered
hours
after
the
water
was
drained.
it
left
my
skin
smelling
like
strong
chemicals
too,
and
not
in
good
way.
the
only
usable
packets
to
me
were
the
green
ones.
the
red
cherry
blossom,
think?
packets
were
the
worst
for
me.
the
smell
was
so
unbearable
had
to
take
shower
about
30
minutes
later
to
try
and
rid
myself
of
it.
maybe
just
have
sensitive
nose?
if
you
are
sensitive
to
smell
don't
recommend.
find
this
pack
very
confusing,
but
it's
not
necessarily
bad
thing....
just
not
expected.
the
packets
are
marked
by
color
pink,
purple,
blue,
green
and
are
each
different.
have
only
tried
two
so
far
--
pink
and
purple.
the
thing
is,
the
pink
packet
has
blue
powder
in
it
it
does
pigment
the
water.,
and
the
purple
has
pink
powder
in
it.
it
just
felt
to
me
like
the
colors
should
match
the
packet
for
ease,
but
it's
not
big
deal
i'm
expecting
blue
to
be
green
and
green
to
be
purple.
:p.
the
scents
are
scents
but
not
like
"rose"
or
even
"flowers".
blue
pink
pack
smells
an
awful
lot
like
tide
detergent,
and
with
the
blue
color,
it
was
little
like
climbing
in
the
washer.
pink
purple
packet
smells
like
irish
spring
soap
exactly
which
should
have
been
green!
xd
it
is
lot
of
added
novelty
and
fun.
i'm
looking
forward
to
figuring
out
what
the
other
two
are
like.i
do
really
love
these
though
for
their
effect.
use
bath
salts
and
soaks
as
part
of
pain
management
routine,
for
joint
pain.
this
gave
the
water
viscous
quality
that
was
very
appealing
and
comfortable.
liked
that
the
pigment
was
actually
visible
and
gave
the
water
milky
color
that
made
the
texture
feel
more
creamy.
it
also
seemed
to
aid
in
the
pain
relief
and
muscle
tension.
that's
the
important
part
to
me,
even
if
it
pink
powder
in
purple
packet
that
smells
like
irish
spring.edit:
have
since
found
out
that
the
green
packet
turns
the
water
murky
greenish
brown
and
smells
very
strongly
of
pine.
am
not
pine
girl,
so
actually
drained
that
one.
can't
tell
how
it
felt
or
worked
for
me.
it
was
just
really
strong.
the
blue
packet
actually
has
blue
pigment,
but
it
isn't
the
milky
blue
that
you
get
in
the
pink
packet.
it's
bright,
clear
blue
that
looks
exactly
like
the
toilet
water,
when
you
put
the
blue
stuff
in
it.
it
has
the
softest
and
most
floral
smell
of
them
all,
but
it
is
still
not
identifiable
as
certain
flower.
it
reminds
me
strongly
of
brand
name
of
body
soap
that
is
sold
in
the
us,
but
cannot
place
the
name.
bought
these
for
my
daughter
who
is
obsessed
with
everything
bath
related...i
didn't
soak
in
it
but
when
she
used
it
it
made
the
house
smell
amazing
so
for
that
thank
you.
most
of
these
bath
things
are
fake
flowery
smelling
and
gaggingly
overpowering,
not
this
one,
it
was
soothing
fresh
calming
lightly
flowery
but
the
good
kind
of
flowery
perfect
for
an
evening
bath
scent.
have
ordering
this
box
many
times!
each
pack
fills
the
tub
with
color
and
great
smell
and
moisturizers
the
skin.
the
box
is
really
cute
it
has
nature
hot
springs
picture
with
texture
detail
and
the
stuff
is
really
relaxing.
no
idea
the
ingredients
because
there
is
no
writing
in
english
but
don't
mind.
love
these.
they
make
your
bath
water
either
blue
or
green.
the
smell
is
nice
for
me
but
its
gonna
be
hit
and
miss
depending
on
your
personal
preference.
if
you
dont
like
strong
floral
fragrances
then
you
should
pass
on
these.
have
fairly
sensitive
skin
and
this
stuff
is
quite
soothing.
not
irritation
at
all.
so
know
there
isny
anything
harsh
in
it
or
id
be
red
and
blotchy.
these
bath
powders
are
the
most
relaxing,
wonderful
experience
i've
ever
had
in
the
bath!
love
fun
bath
products
and
like
to
try
little
bit
of
everything
but
these
shine
brighter
than
the
rest!
i've
reordered
times
already
and
will
never
be
without!
besides
the
wonderful
sensory
experience,
these
give
silky
smooth
skin,
and
even
smooth
hair
if
you
happen
to
get
it
wet.
would
recommend
these
to
everybody!
got
these
for
my
japanese
gf.
she
loves
them.
the
scents
are
wonderful
and
the
colors
are
nice
and
rich.
would
definitely
buy
again
when
she
runs
low.
these
are
much
better
than
the
bath
bombs
and
other
bath
salt
products
that
don't
seem
to
do
much.
like
the
packaging,
smell
and
price
of
these
bath
powders.
reordered
these
because
they
are
some
of
the
best.
used
for
personal
use
but
would
make
great
gift.
now,
have
extremely
sensitive
skin,
so
don't
think
everyone
would
have
this
reaction,
but
my
skin
was
itchy
the
entire
day
after
using
these.
made
in
china
this
was
an
impulse
purchase
that
am
very
glad
bought.
it
comes
with
18
packets
of
four
different
kinds
of
bath
powder.
each
one
smells
amazing
and
is
supposed
to
offer
something
little
different
in
each
bath.
to
be
honest,
bought
it
for
the
pretty
box,
and
its
really
just
treat
to
use
packet
in
bath
after
long
day.
it
seems
like
very
little
product
in
each
packet,
but
once
you
pour
it
in
the
water,
the
aroma
and
color
are
very
strong.
love
using
them!
they
smell
so
super
good
and
they
turn
your
bath
water
bright
colors.
long
lasting
fragrance
too.

my

me
so
much.

be
purchasing

absolutely
amazing,
loved

after
rough

day,
coming

help
me

worth
it.
these
not
only
smell
amazing,
but
my
skin
feels
lovely
and
smell
wonderful
when
get
out
of
bath.
only
wish
they
had
label
in
english
since
few
scents
are
familiar
but
can't
figure
out
what
they
are.
these
packets

is
necessity
and
these
are
on
that
list.
my
skin
feels
great
after
nice
soak
with
book.
like
the
smell
very
much!!!
am
not
sure
about
the
functions
they
put
on
the
package
it
said
that
these
are
"not
for
reproducing
the
real
spring"
in
japanese,
but
they
smell
really
good
and
really
good
to
use.
love
taking
baths.
this
was
great
product
and
even
brought
with
me
on
my

with

little
scent.
would
not
buy
again.
guess
scent
is
very
very
subjective
thing.
for
me,
this
product
smells
like
cheap
toilet
cleanser.
it's
just
about
the
least
calming
scent
can
think
of.
the
smell
is
strong
and
i'm
guessing
it
would
be
featured
in
theme
motel
for
actors
in
bad
newlywed
movie.
it's
also
unnaturally

packet

the
whole

there
are
of
course
gorgeous,
thoughtful,
subtle
and
beautiful
products
coming
