bought
these
as
was
in
the
same
position
as
everyone
else
&
needed
new
charging
port
these
fit
and
because
they
come
with
new
ribbon
cables
it
is
better
kit
than
lot
of
the
single
port
kitshoweveri
replaced
this
jds0
charging
port
in
may
and
by
september
had
to
replace
the
first
replacement
port
because
it
had
failed
too
it
is
currently
november
and
the
second
port
in
the
kit
has
failed,
necessitating
the
purchase
of
another
jds0
kit
this
makes
me
unhappy
once
selected
the
right
component,
this
product
is
exactly
what
we
needed
we
managed
to
repair
the
controller,
with
no
problem
at
all,
and
we
made
huge
savaing,
and
also
we
repaired
rather
than
buying
new
one
so
we
reduced
our
impact
on
the
planet
you
just
need
to
make
sure
you
select
the
right
component
for
the
right
controller
this
part
managed
to
kill
my
controller
in
less
than
secondsto
start
off
fix
electronics
on
daily
basis
so
am
more
than
competant
performing
repairs
fitted
teh
new
charging
pot
jds0
and
and
connected
to
my
ps0
pro
and
the
charging
light
turned
on,
after
about
seconds
the
light
flickered
and
went
off
picked
up
the
controller
and
it
was
getting
really
hot,
and
refused
to
power
on
then
replaced
the
port
with
the
second
one
in
the
pack
but
still
it
wont
turn
on
but
the
controller
however
it
continues
get
hot
when
ever
connected
to
the
power
in
last
ditch
effort
to
check
the
controller
was
still
working
replaced
with
my
original
noncharging
port
and
tried
to
turn
on
but
no
power
led
these
replacement
parts
are
defective
and
have
killed
my
controller,
which
wouldn't
have
me
that
mad
except
that
genuine
dual
shock
is
0,
have
not
doubt
that
with
the
speed
my
controller
was
heating
up
these
are
very
serious
fire
risk
arrived
on
time
and
well
packaged
tool
came
in
handy
and
the
parts
were
easy
to
change
worked
well
for
my
ps0
dualshock
controller
the
usb
ports
are
great
and
was
able
to
fit
them
in
my
dualshock
0s
easily
noticed
that
one
of
the
ribbons
in
the
pack
were
faulty
as
one
of
the
controllers
wasn
turning
on
had
to
use
an
old
ribbon
to
make
the
dual
shock
work
other
than
that,
my
controllers
are
working
again
great
new
item
but
unfortunately
did
not
solve
my
proplem
with
my
controllerpossibly
somethibg
elsebought
new
controller
was
pretty
easy
fix,
followed
one
of
the
many
videos
on
youtube
controller
is
now
charging
fine,
like
new
for
few
quid
better
than
forking
out
for
new
controller
it
works
very
well
the
ribbon
cable
is
longer
then
the
original
makes
it
easier
to
plug
in
very
good
as
i'd
hoped,
replaced
my
existing
charger
with
one
of
these,
and
saved
splurging
on
new
controllervery
easy
to
replace
when
you
look
at
youtube
videos
just
clicks
in
and
then
screw
everything
back
together
good
stuff,
easy
repair
solved
the
problem
do
not
use
this
product
,
bought
this
product
while
ago
and
only
just
got
around
to
fitting
them
to
my
pad
and
all
got
was
pop
and
smoke
coming
from
my
pad
am
now
the
proud
owner
of
brokenmpad
thanks
to
this
product
do
not
buy
absolutely
perfect
had
dead

that
no
longer

happy
lad
here
have
only
used
the
ribbons
so
far
and
they

screwed
on
like
the
original
piece
fantastic
product
easy
fix
very
easy
to
install
and

perfectly
easy
to

great
product
the
two
micro

bother
buying
this
product
bit
expensive
when
compared
to
other
sellers
found
after
ordering,
but
it
worked
and
installation
was
quite
easy
and
my
charging

le
pongo
una
estrella
porque
no
funciona
bien
el
conector
donde
se
introduce
la
cinta
del
cableado
no
hace
buen
contacto
pierde
su
función
aunque
introduzcas
bien
la

aprietes
el
microcierre,
no

sería
mejor
que
el
sistema
fuese
solo
introducir
la

como
el
original
la
placa
encaja
perfectamente
con
la
primera
versión
del

de
ps0
en

caso
he

utilizar
los

que

lo
bueno
es
que
lleva
dos

ya
la
tengo
por
si
se
me
rompe

además
lleva
un

el

en
una

muy
contento
consiglio
di
non
comperare
il
kit
completo
ma
solo
il
connettore
singoli
che
non
funziona,
il
cacciavite
non
serve,
come
non
servono
le
bretelle
di

conviene
lasciare
le

e'
possibile
acquistare
solo
connettori
danneggiati

super
so
at
first
was
little
hesitant
to
buy
it,
but
it
did
work
ok
so
first
my
controller
wasn
turning
on
so
bought
new
battery
because
didn
see
anything
wrong
with
port,
it
wasn
broken
or
anything
replaced
the
battery
and
it
did
turn
on
but
it
wasn
charging
and
so
thought
it
would
be
the
usb
charging
port
read
some
negative
comments
and
wasn
sure
if
should
buy
it
or
not
but
at
the
end
bought
it
mean
still
cheaper
than
buying
new
controller
glad
did
it
seems
to
be
charging
haven
connected
to
my
ps0
since
not
at
home
but
seems
that
it
will
work
one
advice
make
sure
to
fold
the
flex
like
the
original
one
tested
before
closing
it
but
damage
one
of
flexes
because
when
closed
it,
it
got
squish
because
it
wasn
in
the
right
position
finally
when
closed
it
and
tried
to
charge
it,
it
wasn
charging
had
to
opened
again
replace
the
flex
for
new
one
good
thing
they
send
two
folded
the
same
way
the
original
was
and
it
works
you
can
see
it
in
the
pictures
this
is
day
review
so
have
no
clue
how
these
little
boards
will
hold
up,
but
right
out
of
the
box
they
are
great
deal
actually
hadn
realized
this
was
two
pack
and
was
really
happy
to
find
the
second
board
in
the
packthis
is
complete
pack
two
boards,
two
ribbon
cables,
and
little
screw
driver
there
even
slip
of
paper
directing
you
to
ifixit
instructional
vids
for
the
repair
guide
five
stars
on
that
aloneof
course
the
screw
driver
is
junk,
but
the
boards
are
nice
and
tight
as
far
as
the
ports
go
and
everything
assembled
exactly
as
it
shouldhighly
recommended
purchased
this
as
it
was
the
same
one
needed
for
my
controller
that
was
dead
my
playstation
controller
quit
charging
after
using
my
samsung
phone
"fast
charging"
wall
wart
to
charge
my
controller
multiple
timesthis
has
happened
to
of
my
controllers
before
realized
what
was
causing
it
the
controllers
would
still
work
as
long
as
the
battery
had
power,
they
just
would
not
charge
anyways,
if
your
controller
works,
but
will
not
charge,
or
your
cord
has
become
loose
while
plugged
in,
this
is
what
you
need
my
controller
now
charges
normally
after
replacing
the
ps0
controller
can
be
bit
of
pain
to
take
apart,
but
doable
if
you
take
your
time
replacing
this
part
is
pretty
straight
forward
wish
didnt
have
buy
package
of
of
these,
but
am
really
happy
my
$0
controller
is
now
working
againmake
sure
the
part
number
matches
the
one
you
purchase
or
it
will
not
work/fitalso,
the
lights
on
the
controller
are
not
as
bright
with
this
replacement
as
they
were
the
original,
happen
to
like
this
jds0
replacement
charging
port
came
on
time
in
small
shock
proof
envelope
it
took
me
around
half
an
hour
to
remove
the
old
port
and
install
the
new
plugged
in
the
usb
cable
and
it
started
to
charge,
success
the
company,
elecgear,
did
great
job
of
explaining
the
different
ports,
and
the
advise/need
of
opening
your
controlling
to
learn
which
one
you
needed
was
invaluable
this
product
works
and
saves
one
lot
of
money
one
thing
to
consider
is
the
need
to
learn
how
to
open
these
controllers
and
close
then
up
again
you
do
need
to
open
then
to
get
the
type
of
port
you
need
so,
open
and
close
then
at
least
once
worked
great,looked
percent
like
the
original
usb
port,easy
to
installi
was
amazed
to
see
my
controller
charging
like
brand
new
controller,no
shifting
usb
cable
around
for
the
sweet
spot
or
nothingi
plug
it
in
and
bang
is
starts
to
blink
and
chargethey
give
two
in
pack
so
still
have
an
extra
one
for
my
second
controller
ever
breaksjust
as
friendly
caution
there
is
another
vendor
that
sell
very
similar
product
on
amazon
which
bought
it
was
horrible,cheap
made
and
didn't
even
workjust
so
could
save
like
dollars
it
was
bad
move
never
againi
am
not
allowed
to
tell
the
vendor
but
guys
are
smart
so
can
narrow
it
downi
totally
recommended
this
usb
port
replacement
perfect
replacement
for
my
ps0
controller
charging
port
came
extremely
well
packaged
layers
of
packaging
arrived
the
next
day
with
prime
delivery
and
by
evening
my
controller
was
ready
installation
was
easy
following
youtube
tutorial
includes
precision
phillips
screwdriver
if
needed,
ports
and
cablesi
opened
the
controller
prior
to
buying
to
verify
the
exact
model
needed
be
careful
as
there
are
different
model
of
charging
port
depending
on
when
your
controller
was
manufactured
the
dealer
has
all
the
variations
so
choose
knowingly
was
able
to
fix
some
ps0
controllers
that
no
longer
charged
by
installing
these
make
sure
you
open
the
controller
and
look
at
the
old
equipment
before
you
order
so
you
get
the
right
replacement
as
there
are
many
different
types
depending
on
what
generation
ps0
controller
you
have
there
are
plenty
of
youtube
videos
to
show
how
to
change
it
out
id
your
controller
no
longer
charges
keep
in
mind
you
may
need
to
change
this
and
buy
new
battery
also
purchased
new
battery
as
the
controller
wasn't
retaining
the
charge
due
to
battery
being
bad
it
been
over
month
since
bought
it
and
in
the
first
week
it
worked
but
after
while
it
stopped
working
had
to
do
the
same
thing
and
put
it
in
an
angle
so
it
could
charge
then
it
stopped
working
so
tried
the
other
one
and
it
didn
even
work
now
it
doesn
even
work
at
all
it
promising
but
it
doesn
work
take
your
controller
apart
first
to
make
sure
you
get
the
right
portreplacing
the
charging
port
in
my
controller
was
not
hard
at
all
only
screws
and
peeling
back
few
foam
stickers
the
hardest
part
for
me
was
putting
the
halves
controller
back
togetherthe
port
and
ribbon
work
great
the
fit
for
the
ribbon
was
little
tight
but
that
is
good
thing
because
that
means
that
it
will
stay
connected
better
fixed
my
charging
port
use
my
controller
on
my
pc
and
it
was
constantly
disconnecting
mid
game
which
was
driving
me
insanethe
install
was
pretty
easy,
but
still
requires
you
to
take
the
controller
apart
and
some
people
may
struggle
with
thatyou
may
have
to
take
the
controller
apart
to
check
the
numbers
on
the
charging
port
itself
before
ordering
as
there
are
multiple
charging
port
types
used
based
on
controller
model
was
skeptical
at
first
but
it
did
it's
job
combined
this
with
new
battery
and
my
controller
works
perfectly
now
something
you
may
notice
is
the
light
is
not
as
bright
on
this
board
as
on
the
original
this
was
not
big
deal
to
me
because
like
having
less
light
overall
everything
was
breeze
to
install
and
fits
in
place
just
make
sure
you
are
getting
the
correct
part
by
looking
at
the
pictures
the
hardest
part
is
opening
up
your
controller
without
breaking
the
plastic
tabs
plenty
of
how
to
videos
online
to
show
you
how
to
do
it
fixed
broken
controllers
with
these
and
they
come
in
pack
controllers
are
being
used
every
day
for
the
last
few
months
and
are
working
perfectly
works
great
broke
my
port
replacing
my
broken
shell
into
new
shell,
it's
better
than
buying
new
controllerthe
one
on
the
right
is
the
old
one,
left
is
the
new
with
new
ribbon
cable
greatcheck
your
old
port
to
make
sure
you
buy
the
right
one
worth
it
i'm
glad
that
could
finally
find
seller
for
these,
i've
been
looking
everywhere
for
quick
delivery
have
slight
problem
as
both
pieces
do
fit,
but
my
the
led
doesn't
turn
on
for
both
dont
know
if
they're
defective
or
not
but
as
long
as
they
can
charge
i'll
be
alright
with
no
light
bar
this
is
great
as
diy
fix
for
ps0
micro
usb
fix
just
find
youtube
tutorial
on
how
to
change
it
and
you're
golden
it's
was
much
easier
than
thought
it
would
be,,
hardest
part
was
prying
the
control
open
it's
been
couple
of
months
since
fixed
it
and
it
has
been
great
received
with
the
order
so
have
back
up
in
case
my
year
old
damages
it
again
got
it
to
work
my
last
review
said
that
this
fix
didn't
help
but
suppose
checking
the
ribbon
cable
install
would've
been
beneficial
now
have
working,
charging
controller
all
thanks
to
this
input
you
do
not
have
to
be
tech
savvy
to
do
this,
it
is
only
series
of
unscrewing,
taking
small
pieces
off
and
plugging
the
ribbon
in
while
installing
banged
my
leg
on
the
side
of
my
desk,
moved
my
arm
and
chipped
one
of
the
pins
so
be
careful
thankfully
came
with
two
and
it
works
for
the
controller
you
get
from
the
ps0
slim
which
is
the
gen0
controller
thats
probably
why
the
charging
port
micro
usb
and
light
bar
motherboard
have
the
model
name
jds0
it
was
the
exact
board
that
came
with
the
controller
it
worked
fine
with
no
issues
use
these
for
two
different
controllers
got
none
of
these
worked
also
replaced
the
battery
to
make
sure
that
was
not
the
cause
really
tried
giving
this
product
try
broke
down
apart
the
controller
during
three
different
occasions
just
to
make
sure
gave
the
product
chance
but
nothing
saved
big
bucks
with
this
item
when
our
controller
charging
port
went
bad
opened
it
up
and
removed
the
old
and
replaced
with
this
new
one
and
we
were
playing
cod
in
no
time
this
worked
and
kept
me
from
blowing
on
new
controllerit
is
very
simple
to
work
with,
like
lego
pieces
pull
out
the
old,
place
in
the
new
it
is
missing
piece
one
of
them
had
it,
the
other
one
didn't
now
have
port
cant
use
and
need
itedit:
they
contacted
me
and
asked
me
about
my
problem
and
refunded
me
the
money
great
kit
followed
instructions
and
fixed
the
controller
in
min
make
sure
you
take
pictures
of
how
things
go
back
together
before
taking
it
apart
youtube
tutorial
helps
lot
very
satisfied,
thanks
works
as
intended
the
microusb
fit
is
little
tighter
than
stock
which
is
probably
good
thingwish
didn't
have
to
purchase
the
cables
or
mini
screwdriver
but
it's
not
big
deal
contacted
company
about
this
product
they
replied
one
time
and
did
not
reply
again
to
which
the
product
does
not
work
these
connections
are
complicated
and
the
instructions
are
useless
hope
this
help
someone
save
bucks

is
charging
happily
again
found
my
ps0
controller
not
charge
and
watched
video
about
possible
solutions
and
eventually
have
to
replace
charging
port
did
that
step
by
step
and
that
successfully
work
incredibly
easy
to
install
verified
the
model
needed
by
opening
up
my
ps0
controller
and
within
mins
was
up
and
running
and
the
controller
was
charging
againps
be
sure
to
press
the
reset
button
on
the
back
of
the
controller
for
seconds
in
order
to
reset
the
hardware
components
did
that
with
my
kids
and
0yr
old
as
project
because
they
had
broken
both
connectors
by
not
being
careful
they
wanted
to
simply
buy
new
controllers
and
thought
it
would
be
great
chance
to
do
eletronics
project
at
first
they
were
not
into
it
all
but
as
we
went
along
they
got
into
it
and
we
were
all
amazed
that
it
actually
worked
lol
installed
the
part
but
the
controller
isn
coming
on
don
know
if
is
the
mother
board
that
giving
trouble
guess
ll
have
to
get
new
controller
that
small
thing
exactly
what
needed
my
ps0
controller
stopped
charging
and
after
watching
couple
youtube
videos
bought
this
item
and
it
works
fine
and
my
controller
now
charges
again
work
good
it
is
missing
the
ribbon
interlock,
which
makes
item
useless
in
repair
worked
perfectly
takes
little
bit
to
install
but,
there
are
great
videos
on
you
tube
to
help
this
part
is
missing
components
on
the
board
that
are
required
for
proper
operation
this
product
worked
as
needed,
had
to
order
gen
0&0
because
took
apart
my
controllers
too
much,
but
now
they
work
and
everything,
definitely
will
get
again
if
mess
up
bad
saved
me
from
throwing
away
$0
controller
worked
perfectly
worked
to
be
an
exact
fit
happy
the
screwdriver
was
slightly
magnetic,
it
helped
hold
the
tiny
screws
ve
bought
and
replaced
all
controllers
now
and
everything
works
just
fine
easy
to
pick
the
correct
part,
they
list
them
well
came
with
small
screwdriver
not
great
one,
but
still
appreciated,
two
boards
and
two
ribbons
no
complaints
fixed
my
older
ps0
controller
right
up
make
sure
you
pay
attention
to
the
code/number
on
yours
before
you
buy
easy
install
fixed
my
ps0
controller,
so
now
it
will
charge
replacement
parts
are
low
quality,
charger
doesn't
hold
chord
well
which
is
inconvenient
cause
it's
too
long/gets
in
way
of
screw
mounts
etc,
etc
not
worth
the
frustration
with
this
kit
compared
to
how
easy
it
should
be
to
replace
didn
work
at
all
installing
it
was
easy
but
once
controller
was
put
back
together,
error
message
popped
up
saying
it
didn
work
don't
replace
what
you
can
easily
fix
yourself
love
itquicky
delivery
works
like
charm,
even
though
my
problem
ended
up
being
the
batteries
don
purchase
circuit
boards
are
missing
critical
electronic
components,
so
will
not
charge
the
battery
replaced
the
port
and
now
my
controller
charges
again
it's
only
few
days
in,
so
i'll
see
how
well
it
holds
up
over
time
but
it
did
the
job
as
advertised
fixed
my
controller
that
wasnt
charging
and
was
easy
to
install
worked
great
so
far
and
feels
like
it
an
even
tighter
fit
than
the
original
piece
the
ps0
controller
had
would
still
suggest
looking
up
video
to
anyone
not
confident
with
taking
apart
the
controller
but
over
all
very
easy
process
and
would
highly
recommend
this
over
buying
new
controller
great
product
fast
shipping
arrived
on
time,
came
with
replacement
parts
and
screwdriver,
my
hubby
said
the
screwdriver
alone
was
worth
the
price
great
quality
fixed
our
son's
controller
and
have
an
extra
part
to
spare
works
fine,
only
issue
is
that
the
product
is
extremely
fragile
and
the
first
port
broke
trying
to
insert
the
connection
strap,
luckily
they
were
sold
in
sets
so
had
an
extra
connector
to
use
very
easy
to
install
exact
fit
just
check
model
#
ordered
replacement
for
jds0,
took
about
minutes
to
install
and
so
far
every
thing
seems
to
work
like
normal
ok
worked
perfect
and
saved
me
having
to
get
new
controller
great
value
saved
me
$0
for
new
controller
so
im
happy
it
work
fine
save
money

over
priced
but
the

did
the
job
