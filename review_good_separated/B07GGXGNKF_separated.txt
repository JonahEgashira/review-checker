bought
these
as
was
in
the
same
position
as
everyone
else
&
needed
new
charging
port.
these
fit
and
because
they
come
with
new
ribbon
cables
it
is
better
kit
than
lot
of
the
single
port
kits.however.....i
replaced
this
jds-011
charging
port
in
may
2020
and
by
september
2020
had
to
replace
the
first
replacement
port
because
it
had
failed
too.
it
is
currently
november
2020
and
the
second
port
in
the
kit
has
failed,
necessitating
the
purchase
of
another
jds-011
kit
-
this
makes
me
unhappy.
once
selected
the
right
component,
this
product
is
exactly
what
we
needed.
we
managed
to
repair
the
controller,
with
no
problem
at
all,
and
we
made
huge
savaing,
and
also
we
repaired
rather
than
buying
new
one
so
we
reduced
our
impact
on
the
planet.
you
just
need
to
make
sure
you
select
the
right
component
for
the
right
controller.
this
part
managed
to
kill
my
controller
in
less
than
60
seconds.to
start
off

basis
-
so
am
more
than
competant
performing
repairs.
fitted
teh
new
charging
pot
jds-040
and
and
connected
to
my
ps4
pro
and
the
charging
light
turned
on,
after
about
30
seconds
the
light
flickered
and
went
off.
picked
up
the
controller
and
it
was
getting
really
hot,
and
refused
to
power
on.
then
replaced
the
port
with
the
second
one
in
the
pack
but
still
it
wont
turn
on
but
the
controller
however
it
continues
get
hot
when
ever
connected
to
the
power
in
last
ditch
effort
to
check
the
controller

still
working

with
my
original
non-charging
port
and
tried
to
turn
on
but
no
power
led.
these
replacement
parts
are
defective
and
have
killed
my
controller,
which
wouldn't
have
me
that
mad
except
that
genuine
dual
shock

44,
have
not
doubt
that
with
the
speed
my

heating
up

worked
well
for
my
ps4
dualshock
controller.
the
usb
ports
are
great
and
was
able
to
fit
them
in
my
dualshock
4s
easily.
noticed
that
one
of
the
ribbons
in
the
pack
were
faulty
as
one
of
the
controllers
wasn
turning
on.
had
to
use
an
old
ribbon
to
make
the
dual
shock
work.
other
than
that,
my
controllers
are
working
again.

le
pongo
una
estrella
porque
no
funciona
bien.
el

del

pierde
su

aunque

sería
mejor
que
el

solo
introducir

como
el

la

encaja
perfectamente
con

lo
bueno
es
que

dos
unidades
ya
la
tengo
por
si
se
me
rompe

además

un
destornillador
el

se

en
una
bolsita
antiestática.
muy
contento.
consiglio
di
non
comperare
il

solo
il

che
non

il

non
serve,
come
non
servono
le

ottimi
pezzi
di
ricambio
per
controller
ps4.
in
particolare
è
la
porta
usb
per
l'innesto
del
cavo
per
la
ricarica
della
batteria.c'è
anche
il
cacciavite
in
dotazione
che
è
utile.
prestate
attenzione
alla
fascia
di
collegamento,
cercate
di
non
sgualcirla
troppo
nell'inesto.
ho
acquistato
questi
dock
di
ricarica
per
riparare
il

della
ps4
dei

ordinati
sabato

effettuato
la

il
momento
sembra
funzionare
perfettamente.sono
soddisfatto,
almeno
per
ora.p.s.
il
cacciavite
in

è
abbastanza
resistente.consigliato.
la
schedina
è
perfettamente
compatibile
con
l'esistente
cui
contatti
si
sono
usurati
rovinati
col
passare
del
tempo
con
l'uso
volte
improprio
da
parte
di
mio
figlio;
semplice
immediata
la
sostituzione.
fate
attenzione
solo
ad
aprire
il
joypad
ed
richiuderlo
correttamente!
consiglio:
una
volta
sostituita
la
schedina
richiuso
il
joypad,
prima
di
rimettere
stringere
le
viti,
assicurateri
che
tutti

so
at
first
was
little
hesitant
to
buy
it,
but
it
did
work.
ok
so
first
my
controller
wasn
turning
on
so
bought
new
battery
because
didn
see
anything
wrong
with
port,
it
wasn
broken
or
anything.
replaced
the
battery
and
it
did
turn
on.
but
it
wasn
charging
and
so
thought
it
would
be
the
usb
charging
port.
read
some
negative
comments
and
wasn
sure
if
should
buy
it
or
not.
but
at
the
end
bought
it.
mean
still
cheaper
than
buying
new
controller.
glad
did
it
seems
to
be
charging.
haven
connected
to
my
ps4
since
not
at
home
but
seems
that
it
will
work.
one
advice
make
sure
to
fold
the
flex
like
the
original
one.
tested
before
closing
it.
but
damage
one
of
flexes
because
when
closed
it,
it
got
squish
because
it
wasn
in
the
right
position.
finally
when
closed
it
and
tried
to
charge
it,
it
wasn
charging
had
to
opened
again
replace
the
flex
for
new
one.
good
thing
they
send
two.
folded
the
same
way
the
original
was
and
it
works.
you
can
see
it
in
the
pictures
this
is
day
review
so
have
no
clue
how
these
little
boards
will
hold
up,
but
right
out
of
the
box
they
are
great
deal.
actually
hadn
realized
this
was
two
pack
and
was
really
happy
to
find
the
second
board
in
the
pack.this
is
complete
pack.
two
boards,
two
ribbon
cables,
and
little
screw
driver.
there
even
slip
of
paper
directing
you
to
ifixit
instructional
vids
for
the
repair
guide.
five
stars
on
that
alone.of
course
the
screw
driver
is
junk,
but
the
boards
are
nice
and
tight
as
far
as
the
ports
go
and
everything
assembled
exactly
as
it
should.highly
recommended.
purchased
this
as
it
was
the
same
one
needed
for
my
controller
that
was
dead.
my
playstation
controller
quit
charging
after
using
my
samsung
phone
"fast
charging"
wall
wart
to
charge
my
controller
multiple
times....this
has
happened
to
of
my
controllers
before
realized
what
was
causing
it.
the
controllers
would
still
work
as
long
as
the
battery
had
power,
they
just
would
not
charge.
anyways,
if
your
controller
works,
but
will
not
charge,
or
your
cord
has
become
loose
while
plugged
in,
this
is
what
you
need.
my
controller
now
charges
normally
after
replacing.
the
ps4
controller
can
be
bit
of
pain
to
take
apart,
but
doable
if
you
take
your
time.
replacing
this
part
is
pretty
straight
forward.
wish
didnt
have
buy
package
of
of
these,
but
am
really
happy
my
$60
controller
is
now
working
again!make
sure
the
part
number
matches
the
one
you
purchase
or
it
will
not
work/fit!also,
the
lights
on
the
controller
are
not
as
bright
with
this
replacement
as
they
were
the
original,
happen
to
like
this.

it

around
half

to

and
install
the

plugged

and
it

success.
the
company,
elecgear,
did
great
job
of
explaining
the
different
ports,
and
the
advise/need
of
opening
your
controlling
to
learn
which
one
you
needed
was
invaluable.
this
product
works
and
saves
one
lot
of
money.
one
thing
to
consider
is
the
need
to
learn
how
to
open
these
controllers
and
close
then
up
again.
you
do
need
to
open
then
to
get
the
type
of
port
you
need.
so,
open
and
close
then
at
least
once.
worked
great,looked
98
percent
like
the
original
usb
port,easy
to
install.i
was
amazed
to
see
my
controller
charging
like
brand
new
controller,no
shifting
usb
cable
around
for
the
sweet
spot
or
nothing.i
plug
it
in
and
bang
is
starts
to
blink
and
charge.they
give
two
in
pack
so
still
have
an
extra
one
for
my
second
controller
ever
breaks.just
as
friendly
caution
there
is
another
vendor
that
sell
very
similar
product
on
amazon
which
bought
it
was
horrible,cheap
made
and
didn't
even
work.just
so
could
save
like
dollars
it
was
bad
move
never
again.i
am
not
allowed
to
tell
the
vendor
but
guys
are
smart
so
can
narrow
it
down.i
totally
recommended

opened
the

prior
to
buying
to
verify
the
exact
model
needed.
be
careful
as
there
are
4-5
different
model
of
charging

depending
on
when
your

was

has
all
the
variations

choose
knowingly.
was
able
to
fix
some
ps4
controllers
that
no
longer
charged
by
installing
these.
make
sure
you
open
the
controller
and
look
at
the
old
equipment
before
you
order
so
you
get
the
right
replacement
as
there
are
many
different
types
depending
on
what
generation
ps4
controller
you
have.
there
are
plenty
of
youtube
videos
to
show
how
to

out.
id
your
controller
no
longer
charges
keep
in
mind
you
may
need
to
change
this
and
buy
new
battery..
also
purchased
new
battery
as
the
controller
wasn't
retaining
the
charge
due
to
battery
being
bad.
it
been
over
month
since
bought
it
and
in
the
first
week
it
worked
but
after
while
it
stopped
working
had
to
do
the
same
thing
and
put
it
in
an
angle
so
it
could
charge
then
it
stopped
working.
so
tried
the
other
one
and
it
didn
even
work.
now
it
doesn
even
work
at
all
it
promising
but
it
doesn
work.
take
your
controller
apart
first
to
make
sure
you
get
the
right
port.replacing
the
charging
port
in
my
controller
was
not
hard
at
all.
only
screws
and
peeling
back
few
foam
stickers.
the
hardest
part
for
me
was
putting
the
halves
controller
back
together.the
port
and
ribbon
work
great
the
fit
for
the
ribbon
was
little
tight
but
that
is
good
thing
because
that
means
that
it
will
stay
connected
better.
fixed
my
charging
port!
use
my
controller
on
my
pc
and
it
was
constantly
disconnecting
mid
game
which
was
driving
me
insane.the
install
was
pretty
easy,
but
still
requires
you
to
take
the
controller
apart
and
some
people
may
struggle
with
that.you
may
have
to
take
the
controller
apart
to
check
the
numbers
on
the
charging
port
itself
before
ordering
as
there
are
multiple
charging
port
types
used
based
on
controller
model.
was
skeptical
at
first
but
it
did
it's
job.
combined
this
with
new
battery
and
my
controller
works
perfectly
now.
something
you
may
notice
is
the
light
is
not
as
bright
on
this
board
as
on
the
original.
this
was
not
big
deal
to
me
because
like
having
less
light.
overall
everything
was
breeze
to
install
and
fits
in
place.
just
make
sure
you
are
getting
the
correct
part
by
looking
at
the

thanks
to

you
do
not
have
to
be
tech
savvy
to
do
this,
it
is
only
series
of
unscrewing,
taking
small
pieces
off
and
plugging
the
ribbon
in.
while
installing
banged
my
leg
on
the
side
of
my
desk,
moved
my
arm
and
chipped
one
of
the
pins
so
be
careful!

two!

it
works
for
the
controller

get
from

is

in
the
dual

one
difference
is
on
the
old
one,
the
ribbon
cable
just
pushes
in,
on
this
one,
after
you
insert
the
cable,
there's
tiny
flap
to
fold
down
to
'lock'

and

incredibly
easy
to

verified
the
model
needed
by
opening
up
my
ps4
controller
and
within
15
mins
was
up
and
running
and
the
controller

seconds

the
hardware
components
did
that
with
my
kids
10
and
9yr
old
as
project
because
they
had
broken
both
connectors
by
not
being
careful.
they
wanted
to
simply
buy
new
controllers
and
thought
it
would
be
great
chance
to
do
eletronics
project
.
at
first
they
were
not
into
it
all
but
as
we
went
along
they
got
into
it
and
we
were
all
amazed
that
it
actually
worked
!
lol!
installed
the
part
but
the
controller
isn
coming
on
don
know
if
is
the
mother
board
that
giving
trouble
guess
ll
have
to
get
new
controller
that
small
thing
exactly
what
needed.
my
ps4
controller
stopped
charging
and
after
watching
couple
youtube
videos
bought
this
item
and
it
works
fine
and
my
controller
now
charges
again.
work
good
it
is
missing
the
ribbon
interlock,
which
makes
item
useless
in
repair

perfectly.
takes
little
bit
to
install
but,
there
are
great
videos
on
you
tube
to
help.
this
part
is
missing
components
on
the
board
that
are
required
for
proper
operation.
this
product
worked
as
needed,
had
to
order
gen
1&2
because
took
apart
my
controllers
too
much,
but
now
they
work
and
everything,
definitely
will
get
again
if
mess
up
bad.

not
worth
the
frustration
with
this
kit
compared
to
how
easy

should
be
to

at
all!!
installing

the
job
as
advertised.
fixed
my
controller
that
wasnt
charging
and
was
easy
to
install.
worked
great
so
far
and
feels
like
it
an
even
tighter
fit
than
the
original
piece
the
ps4
controller
had.
would
still
suggest
looking
up
video
to
anyone
not
confident
with
taking
apart
the
controller
but
over
all
very
easy
process
and
would
highly
recommend
this
over
buying
new
controller.

controller
and

only
issue

fragile
and
the
first

trying
to
insert

luckily
they
were
sold
