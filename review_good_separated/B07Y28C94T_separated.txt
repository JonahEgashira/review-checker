own

headphones,
so
was

quality
and
sound
you
get
from
this
companyi
had
been
eyeing
pair
of
the
mw0
plus'
for
while
now,
but
they
never
seemed
to
be
available
on
amazon
so
when
they
turned
up
for
under
0,
jumped
at
the
opportunityeverything
about
these
earphones
is
topnotch
include
the
packaging
in
there
too
which
just
oozes
class
you
get
an
amazing
selection
of
accessories
in
the
box:
usbc
to
usbc
charging
cable,
usbc
to
usba
adaptor
and
wide
range
of
silicon
buds
and
wings
to
ensure
you
get
the
perfect
fit
found
the
wings
and
buds
preinstalled
on
the
earphones
fitted
perfectlythe
earphones
and
case
came
fully
charged
right
out
of
the
box
clever
use
of
little
plastic
stickers
ensured
the
connections
didn't
make
contact
so
the
battery
wouldn't
drain
the
case
is
very
compact
but
attracts
fingerprints
like
you
wouldn't
believe
looks
like
it
would
scratch
very
easily
but
luckily
m&d
have
you
covered
by
including
fabric
pouchthe
sound
is
exactly
what
expected
from
these
guys
crystal
clear,
very
neutral,
and
no
harshness
evident
in
the
mids
and
highs
not
overly
bassy,
but
instead
you
get
bass
where
you
need
it
paired
with
my
samsung
tablet
using
aptx
and
listening
to
some
of
the
masters
tracks
on
tidal
was
just
amazing
if
these
were
wired
earphones
would
still
be
amazed
at
how
good
they
sound
the
fact
that
you
can
get
such
highquality
sound
from
pair
of
true
wireless
buds
is
nothing
short
of
incrediblethe
noise
cancellation
is
ok
nothing
great
it's
never
going
to
rival
overear
headphones,
but
have
to
say,
for
me,
it
was
easily
on
par
with
the
sony
wf0xm0
which
returned
as
the
quality
of
the
sound
didn't
compensate
for
the
disappointing
nc
the
mw0's
sound
way
better
than
the
sonysif
you
want
outstanding
sound,
build
quality,
battery
life,
style,
and
you're
not
too
fussed
about
noise
canceling,
these
are
the
earphones
for
you
these
are
far
from
the
cheapest
earbuds
available,
but
rank
very
highly
indeed
for
sound
quality
and
ease
of
fit
the
latter
is
critical,
as
having
excellent
sound
is
of
little
use
if
the
earbuds
are
not
comfortable
for
long
periods
m&d
provide
selection
of
buds
and
"wings"
to
help
you
get
the
optimal
fit
which
is
needed
to
get
the
best
sound
as
well
as
comfort
found
the
ones
prefitted
size
were
perfect
fit
charging
is
via
usbc,
with
an
adaptor
to
usba
being
included
nice
touch
and
the
stainless
steel
case
can
be
used
to
charge
the
earbuds
when
you
are
out
and
abouti
have
pair
of
the
original
mw0s
and
find
them
very
good
the
plus
are
even
better,
with
smooth,
detailed
rendition
of
different
music
types,
loud
and
quieter
they
really
do
rival
good
overear
headphones:
have
tried
them
in
comparison
with
my
sennheisers,
and
they
compare
favourably
allowing
for
the
very
different
designs
involved
another
huge
advantage
over
the
original
mw0s
is
massive
increase
in
battery
life
the
biggest
weakness
of
the
originals
was
the
paltry
hours
made
worse
by
the
weird
design
decision
to
momentarily
distort
the
sound
as
lowbattery
warningany
downsides
they
are
not
inconspicious,
with
the
design
making
them
easily
visible
if
low
profile
for
your
earbuds
is
important,
pair
of
jabra
0t
or
0t
would
be
better
but
their
shape
makes
them
much
harder
to
grasp
firmly
know
from
experience
of
pair
of
0t
how
easy
they
are
to
drop,
and
while
good
the
jabras
definitely
don't
match
the
sound
of
the
m&d
products
also,
the
stainless
steel
case
is
as
others
have
said
fingerprint
magnetif
earbud
sound
quality
is
paramount,
don't
hesitate
about
acquiring
pair
of
mw0
plus
without
delay
if
it
is
quality
sound
you
are
after
cannot
recommend
them
more
highly
look
good,
good
fit,
good
battery
life
and
fantastic
soundonly
downside
is
the
noise
cancellation,
not
great
but
personally,
that
does
not
bother
me
great
product

will
go

yeah
thats
right
out
of
baby
these
sick
got
friends
who
got
jelly
on
first
sight
them
black
quartz
are
soo
classy
great
sounding
wireless
earbuds
have
used
bose
and
jbl
wireless
buds,
but
the
sound
quality
of
this
pair
is
definitely
better
than
those
the
noise
cancellation
is
not
that
great
also,
it
doesn't
like
any
equalizers
or
sound
enhancements
on
the
phone
get
the
best
sound
quality
when
turn
those
options
off
on
the

the
sound
is

warm
with
tight
bass
battery
life
is
amazing
very
happy
with
the
purchase
well
done
m&d
without
writing
too
much
i've
gone
through
sets
now
the
set
is
very
pricey
and
figured
why
not
because
you
shouldn't
have
to
buy
earbuds
over
and
over
they
look
awesome
and
very
premium
they
look
expensivethe
first
set
kept
popping
and
issues
with
quality
it
connected
to
an
iphone
after
some
hassle
it
was
not
as
quick
and
easy
as
it
was
made
to
believe
then
changed
to
an
iphone
0pro
and
still
same
issues
when
it
did
the
connection
kept
dropping
it
didn't
feel
like
the
near
$0
had
paid,
was
worth
it
contacted
m&d
and
it
took
long
time
to
resolve
and
be
taken
care
of
months
they
were
responsive
in
email
but
execution
was
slow
maybe
it
was
the
pandemicsecond
pair
was
sent
to
replace
original
purchased
from
amazon
m&d
had
sent
me
refurbished
set
which
was
disappointing
despite
waiting
such
long
time
the
set
received
its
charging
case
was
scratched
badly
that's
what
gave
it
away
being
"used"
pair
was
expecting
brand
new
replacement
as
was
told
in
email
it
was
still
under
warrantythird
pair
came
and
now
it's
where
it's
supposed
to
be
for
being
an
expensive
set
it
connects
fine,
there
are
no
poppings
or
dropping
off,
etc
etcso
the
third
pair
redeemed
and
validated
the
expensive
purchase
try
out
the
different
fitments
to
make
sure
you
have
good
fit
and
then
sound
is
amazing
it
connects
to
phone,
tablet,
as
well
as
the
tv
just
fine
ordered
these
earbuds
even
though
felt
the
price
was
excessive
because
will
pay
more
for
quality
after
short
test
felt
the
price
was
not
justified
for
me
and
returned
them
regret
not
testing
them
longer
the
volume
was
bit
low
at
maximum,
which
may
have
been
my
source,
or
lack
of
brake
in
time,
but
the
sound
quality
was
excellent
the
connection
and
extended
range
are
great
because
connect
to
my
tv
and
could
walk
around
without
dropouts
the
anc
is
not
as
effective
as
some
other
earbuds
but
the
good
fit
cancels
most
ambient
sounds
they
look
beautiful
and
the
fit
is
comfortable
and
secure
the
case
is
beautiful
but
will
show
scratches
if
not
handled
with
kid
gloves
if
you
are
critical
listener,
appreciate
high
quality
and
need
the
extended
range
highly
recommend
these
earbuds
will
probably
reorder
them
was
pretty
disappointed
with
these
earbuds
because
of
few
things0
first
was
soundi'm
not
sure
what
it
is
about
the
sound,
but
it
felt
somewhat
shallow
and
didn't
feel
as
immersive
as
many
of
my
other
earbudsfor
instance,
my
sony
wf0xm0
sounds
much
deeper
and
immersive
even
though
it
doesn't
use
aptx
for
earbuds
that
do
use
aptx,
my
audiotechnica
cks0tw
and
anker
soundcore
liberty
pro
sound
like
they
have
much
deeper
sounds
heck,
even
my
jaybird
vista
using
sbc
sounds
deeper
albeit
with
some
manual
equalizing
in
the
appdon't
get
me
wrong,
it
has
decent
sounds
although
find
the
highs
tiny
bit
too
harsh
for
my
liking
so
totally
understand
the
people
who
say
it
sounds
absolutely
fantastic
and
they
love
it
just
never
found
that
liked
the
sound
on
these
as
much
as
my
other
earbuds0
second
is
the
app
there
is
none
for
these
earbudsthat's
right
there's
no
app
for
updating
firmware,
doing
manual
equalizer
adjustments,
and
customizing
shortcuts/earbud
behaviourpersonally,
wanted
to
disable
the
automatic
play/pause
when
you
take
the
earbuds
out
of
your
ears
because
half
the
time
it
wouldn't
work
properly,
but
with
no
app,
you
just
have
to
accept
it
for
what
it
isif
these
were
~0
cad
earbuds,
wouldn't
mind
this
but
for
cad
earbuds
like
these,
an
app
with
at
least
some
customization
options
should
almost
be
guaranteed0
third
was
comfort
which
is
completely
subjective
and
different
for
everyonethe
wings
which
you
put
under
your
ear
ridges
are
very
uncomfortable
for
me,
and
always
started
feeling
pains
few
minutes
after
putting
them
on
tried
all
the
wing
sizes
and
looked
up
the
"proper"
way
to
put
them
on,
but
no
matter
what
tried,
it
still
started
hurting
in
matter
of
minutesi
also
didn't
like
the
angle
of
the
sound
nozzle
as
it
didn't
seem
to
point
into
my
ear
canal
but
didn't
mind
that
because
could
still
get
good
seal,
and
the
nozzle
was
never
what
hurt,
it
was
always
the
ear
wingsalmost
all
the
reviews
i've
seen
said
it
fits
them
great,
so
i'm
surprised
that
have
to
say
this
is
the
first
pair
of
earbuds
which
had
to
return
mainly
because
it
hurt
so
much
to
use
so
this
is
really
"your
mileage
may
vary"
thingeverything
else
about
these
were
fine
aesthetics
were
great
with
the
weighty
metal
case
although
it's
fingerprint
magnet,
and
the
earbuds
themselves
looked
nice
the
speed
that
it
connected
was
fast
each
time
you
took
out
the
earbuds,
and
it
was
great
that
you
could
use
the
right
or
left
earbud
alone
love
physical
buttons
so
the
fact
that
it
has
dedicated
buttons
for
volume
up/down
on
the
left
earbud
were
big
plus
for
me
the
anc
works
and
is
fine,
but
wasn't
as
strong
as
sony's
anc
at
cancelling
random
soundsif
the
sound
and
comfort
were
better
for
me,
then
would
have
absolutely
loved
these
but
unfortunately,
don't
recommend
them,
especially
not
when
they
cost
so
much
exceptional
sound
quality
mm
aptx
&
long
battery
life
the
noise
cancellation
isn't
the
best,
although
it
does
work
to
some
degree
this
would
be
the
one
shortcoming
that
think
needs
to
be
addressed
otherwise,
they're
mostly
comfortable,
considering
that
i've
never
been
fan
of
traditional
earbud
headphones
i've
ordered
some
upgraded
comply
tips,
hoping
that
will
help
with
sound
isolation
and
comfort
bit
overall
love
these
headphones,
and
have
absolutely
none
of
the
bluetooth
issues
everyone
else
seems
to
be
talking
about
and
my
phone
is
over
years
old,
google
pixel0
call
quality
is
good
too,
or
at
least
nobody
ever
complains
about
not
being
able
to
hear
me
solid
recommend,
they're
worth
the
money
if
you're
willing
to
fork
over
the
cash
for
them

i've
owned
lot
of
earbuds
and
headphones,
and
these
are
the
clearest,
most
detailed
ones
i've
ever
listened
to
worth
every
penny
the
tws

to
go
for
excellent

decent

very
good

but
they
all
are
excellent
build
quality,
sound,
and
battery
life
have
been
using
them
for
short
time
week
but
right
away
ran
into
an
issue
with
btooth
connectivityi
have
had
many
different
wireless
earbuds,
jabra,
jaybird,
m&d,
airpods
and
another
option
that
cannot
recall
at
the
moment,
with
the
exception
of
the
airpods,
all
buds
have
had
issues
with
btooth
connectivity
so
when
saw
m&d
had
btooth
was
excited
have
been
using
the
original
airpods
over
the
last
year
or
so
and
can
say,
their
connection
is
rock
solid
however
really
do
not
like
the
fiti
ordered
the
mw0+
fired
them
up
in
the
house,
worked
fantastic,
fiddled
with
the
fins
to
get
very
secure
fit
next
up
was
the
gym,
arrived
onsite,
turned
on
the
music
and
slipped
my
phone
into
my
pocket,
almost
immediately
btooth
lost
connection
and
continued
to
do
so
for
the
next
minutes
this
did
not
happen
with
my
airpods
and
cell
phone,
same
cell,
just
different
earbuds
problems
with
btooth
are
less
apparent
when
the
phone
is
not
in
my
pocket
but
still
there
connectivity
is
what
matters
to
me
most,
so
for
the
price,
less
then
thrilled
if
the
issue
persist,
will
probably
return
them
and
go
with
new
airpodsupdate:
have
been
using
the
mw0+
in
variety
of
places,
gym,
grocery
shopping,
work,
home,
etc
and
the
issues
with
bluetooth
have
been
much
more
apparent
than
previously
experienced
for
example,
was
at
the
gym
and
experienced
significant
interference
while
on
the
main
floor,
regardless
if
my
cell
was
in
my
pocket
or
propped
on
the
cardio
machine
right
in
front
of
my
face,
was
getting
poor
signal
did
notice
that
if
put
my
cell
directly
in
front
of
me,
turn
my
head
to
my
right,
the
signal
would
break
almost
everytime
within
seconds,
head
turned
to
the
left,
didnt
occur,
maybe
the
bluetooth
receiver
is
in
the
right
earbudi
also
experienced
extended
times
when
would
not
have
any
breaks
in
signal
im
really
unsure
what
the
issues
are
but
considering
the
wide
variety
of
problems,
submitted
return
requeststill
looking
for
earbuds
that
offer
rock
solid

connectivity
that
are
not

of
the

pros:

one
device
at
time
expensiveafter
reading
several
reviews,
decided
to
ante
up
for
the
master
&
dynamic
mw0
plus
earbuds
my
main
reasons
for
trying
were
good
sound,
presence
of
volume
control,
good
battery
life,
and
active
noise
canceling
the
earbuds
satisfied
the
first
three
expectations
however,
the
active
noise
canceling
sucks
engaging
the
anc
did
not
suppress
traffic
noise
or
planes
flying
overhead
could
hear
absolutely
no
difference
in
noise
with
the
anc
on
or
off
very
surprising
and
disappointing
this
is
in
stark
contrast
to
the
bose
qc
and
audiotechnica
athanc0
review
by
the
soungguyscom
gives
noise
isolation/attenuation
score
of
out
of
in
contrast
to
some
other
earbuds
such
as
the
airpods
pro
or
sony
wf0xm0
that
scored
much
higher
in
addition,
several
other
issues
popped
up
as
continued
to
use
them
first,
found
these
earbuds
uncomfortable
to
wear
after
about
an
hour
with
both
ears
getting
sore
this
is
undoubtedly
specific
to
each
person
ear
anatomy
second,
the
bluetooth
range
was
less
than
expected
although
the
company
mentions
ft
connectivity
range,
my
own
experience
was
less
than
feet
even
then,
the
earbuds
were
more
sensitive
to
interruptions
than
apple
airpods
third,
every
time
when
connecting
these
earbuds
to
my
television,
the
earbuds
suffer
from
bluetooth
stuttering
for
about
minute
before
the
sound
transmission
stabilizes
maybe
that
is
an
issue
with
my
television,
maybe
with
the
earbuds
same
thing
every
time
pausing
and
restarting
streaming
services
an
oddity
when
pairing
these
earbuds
is
that
two
listing
for
these
earbuds
show
up
on
devices:
one
for
the
right
ear
and
one
for
the
left
ear
principally
because
of
the
lack
of
robust
anc,
can
only
give
these
earbuds
rating
of
two
stars
after
losing
three
pairs
of
apple
earpods
decided
to
give
these
go
thought
would
take
better
care
of
them
more
as
they
seemed
prettier
and
like
want
to
take
good
care
of
them
am
so
impressed
the
sound
quality,
never
have
problems
with
the
microphone
on
conference
calls
lot
of
the
day,

has
never
been
an

and
have

what
surprised
me
most
is
the
fit
of
these
they
are
extremely
comfortable,
often
forget
they
are
in
my
ears
and
they
never
fall
out
like
my
apple
ones

track
going
to
take
very
good
care
of
these
babies
have
been
using
this
headphones
for
couple
of
months
now
so
feel
can
write
an
educated
review
out
of
the
box
these
headphones
look
incredible
the
weight
of
the
charging
case
and
velvet
pouch
make
them
seem
like
high
quality
product
after
determining
how
to
place
the
headphones
in
my
ear
cranked
up
the
music
was
very
impressed
with
the
sound
quality
of
these
wireless
headphones
although
battery
life
is
decent
don
feel
that
they
last
the
full
time
advertised
charging
in
the
case
is
very
fast
thoughafter
wearing
them
couple
hours
found
them
to
not
want
to
stay
in
my
ear
well
began
experimenting
with
the
different
sized
wings
and
ear
tips
none
included
seemed
to
help
the
firmest
problem
was
having
find
them
very
uncomfortable
to
wear
for
more
than
an
hour
or
so
working
out
in
them
is
almost
impossible
if
you
re
doing
anything
more
than
riding
an
exercise
bike
they
just
fall
out
and
constantly
have
to
mess
with
them
and
readjustnoise
canceling
is
basically
non
existent
this
is
the
biggest
letdown
out
of
all
the
letdowns
these
premium
headphones
provide
loosely
set
your
finger
tip
in
your
ear
and
you
will
experience
the
same
love
of
noise
cancellation
offered
by
these
headphones
ambient
listening
mode
is
only
slightly
better
though
it
makes
things
sound
very
artificialconnectivity
is
kind
of
pain
really
don
like
how
you
can
only
be
connected
to
one
device
at
time
this
makes
it
inconvenient
when
they
connect
to
my
phone
but
trying
to
listen
to
what
playing
on
my
ipad
you
have
to
go
in
to
one
device
and
disconnect
and
then
reconnected
the
desired
device
every
timethe
airpod
pro
that
my
wife
owns
are
far
superior
in
almost
every
way
to
these
headphones
they
fit
fantastic
whereas
the
m&d
have
poor
fit
and
are
very
uncomfortable
to
me
the
noise
cancelling
capabilities
were
such
let
down
tried
liking
these
headphones
very
hard
wanted
to
like
them
they
look
fantastic
and
really
enjoy
having
something
little
different
instead
of
another
pair
of
airpods
gave
them
so
much
time,
telling
myself
would
get
used
to
the
fit,
but
really
don
think
ever
willbottom
line,
just
get
airpod
pro
they
are
better
in
almost
every
category
and
real
life
use
applications
the
fact
that
they
are
also
about
$0
cheaper
than
the
m&d
makes
them
an
easy
winner
wish
liked
them
more
because
they
look
so
much
better
than
the
airpods
now
stuck
with
them
if
these
were
priced
maybe
at
$0
then
they
might
seem
like
better
alternative
but
at
about
$0
just
don
get
the
value
for
moneymaybe
have
strange
shaped
ear
and
these
will
fit
others
better
based
on
all
the
reviews
read
people
seem
to
get
good
fit
with
them
but
not
me
if
you
don
plan
on
using
the
noise
cancelling
maybe
you
could
give
them
shot
but
honestly
just
can
justify
spending
more
than
any
other
wireless
ear
pods
because
of
the
lack
of
noise
cancelling
would
probably
suggest
just
getting
the
older
model
that
doesn
come
with
the
feature
since
it
doesn
do
anything
anyway

of
lanyardi've
tested
these
against
the
jaybird
vistas
and
have
to
say,
the
jaybirds
took
the
cake
in
my
opinioni
like
to
feel
the
bass,
and
with
the
mw0's
barely
felt
any
bass,
the
jaybirds
have
very
deep
bass
or
very
light
bass
with
the
customizable
app
and
for
about
0$
less
just
goes
to
show
sometimes
the
more
expensive
something
is
doesn't
necessarily
mean
it's
better
after
having
the
original
airpods,
made
the
decision
to
switch
to
master&dynamic's
mw0plus
rather
than
upgrade
to
or
pro,
partly
because
wanted
to
support
smaller
business
after
so
many
years
of
giving
apple
so
much
of
my
moneythese
headphones
are
awesome,
couldn't
be
happier
with
themfirst
thing
noticed
was
that
the
sound
was
better
than
my
airpords
it's
crispy
clear,
rich
and
has
deeper
bassthe
bluetooth
range
is
really
impressive
almost
walked
to
the
end
of
my
block
and
could
still
hear
perfectly
they
connect
seamlessly
between
my
pixel
phone,
ipad
and
other
devicesi
only
have
to
charge
them
once
week
at
least
hours
of
playtime
at
the
moment
and
they
charge
in
about
half
an
hour
can't
say
how
that
will
fare
in
the
future,
though
but
the
product
feels
slightly
more
sturdy
and
better
made
than
other
buds
i've
tried
from
the
stainless
steel
charging
case
to
the
silicone
fit
wings
on
the
inserts,
it
all
feels
like
it's
going
to
last
longercouple
of
other
big
pluses
for
me
you
can
use
just
one
earphone
at
time,
and
find
these
to
be
more
comfortable
than
my
old
airpods
don't
know
if
it's
just
my
ears
but
these
m&ds
never
fall
out,
especially
while
exercising
which
my
airpods
often
did
and
it
barely
feels
like
i'm
wearing
anything
in
my
earsnoise
cancelling
and
microphone
quality
are
goodone
small
thing
to
take
note
of
the
steel
blue
is
darker
and
not
quite
as
glossy
as
it
looks
in
the
picsbut
overall,
these
are
really
great
wireless
earbuds
ordered
these
expecting
to
love
them
the
sound
is
very
nice
the
base
has
nice
feel
to
it
as
does
the
feeling
of
stage/room
fit
is
great
looks
are
very
nice
now
for
the
bad
particularly
for
some
classical
the
volume
tops
off
too
early
needs
little
more
volume
range
the
deadly
issue
for
me,
however,
was
connectivity
the
connectivity
issues
for
me
make
no
sense
will
be
sitting
in
the
same
position
typing
and
suddenly
will
get
loud
"waumph"
sound
that
they
make
when
loosing
connection
the
connection
is
not
totally
lost
and
the
music
drops
in
volume
but
continues
this
happens
without
any
special
rhyme
or
reason
it
could
be
fine
for
an
hour
and
then
two
successive
"waumph"
within
minute
of
each
other
on
the
train,
ride
could
be
fine
and
suddenly
before
arriving
"waumph"
never
had
this
problem
with
my
b&os
or
airpods
pros
for
me,
at
this
price,
this
is
deal
breaker
really
disappointed
since
otherwise
they
are
very
nice
these
babies
are
going
back
until
the
problem
is
addressed
first,
let
me
start
by
sayingi
think
have
an
addiction
to
bluetooth
earbuds
i'm
also
fairly
frugal,
so
my
growing
collection
of
earbuds
is
mostly
made
up
of
cheap
noname
brand
earbuds
that
sound
great
for
the
price
i've
also
been
buying
anker
earbuds
for
years,
and
i've
always
loved
the
sound
my
latest
one
was
the
liberty
pro,
and
thought
they
were
the
best
sounding
earbuds
to
me,
with
clarity
in
the
mids
and
highs,
but
still
very
deep
booming
bass
love
rap
and
hiphop,
and
workout
regularly
so
the
bass
keeps
me
going
through
hard
sessionsthese
became
my
benchmarkthe
passive
noise
cancelation
is
good
on
the
liberty
pro'salmost
too
good
commute
to
work
and
can
hardly
ear
thing
with
them
inthat
can
be
good
or
bad
thingbut
for
me
feel
it's
fairly
dangerous
to
not
be
aware
of
your
surroundingsso
hear
come
mw0
plus
prioritized
great
sound
and
the
transparency
mode
reviews
i've
read
indicated
that
both
were
great
other
reviews
also
have
said
anc
is
not
the
greatest
agree
with
both
of
these
however,
most
of
the
time
passive
cancelation
is
good
enough
for
me
and
the
only
time
care
to
block
out
sound
is
on
airplanes
don't
fly
frequently
enough
so
can
overlook
not
having
excellent
ancfirst
let
me
saywhen
first
put
the
mw0s
into
my
ear,
was
disappointed
the
volume
seemed
lower
than
my
liberty
pros
and
the
bass
was
not
as
strong
compared
few
of
my
favorite
rap
songs
on
both
and
thought
liberty
pro
sounded
better,
so
was
considering
returning
the
mw0s
then
played
"all
of
me"
my
john
legend
which
is
pure
piano
and
vocalsno
drum
sequence
in
the
song
and
that's
when
realized
what
this
product
was
designed
foras
listened
through
the
mw0si
closed
my
eyes
and
just
listed
to
the
clarity
of
the
vocals,
all
of
the
nuances
of
tones
as
each
piano
key
played,
and
got
the
shivers
it
was
amazing
switched
back
to
the
liberty
pro
to
see
if
maybe
it
was
just
in
my
headit
wasn't
the
mw0s
are
designed
for
music
period
not
bass
thumping
rap
where
beats
are
created
through
synthsbut
pure
musicthe
way
it
was
meant
to
be
heardi've
been
rocking
these
mw0s
for
week,
and
have
realized
now
that
for
as
long
as
have
been
buying
bluetooth
earbudsi
have
been
listening
to
music
through
ones
that
emphasized
bass
too
heavily
thought
that
was
what
made
great
sounding
earbuds
and
that
was
my
point
of
reference
was
wrong
and
don't
think
can
go
back
nowtransparency
mode
is
great
and
very
natural
sounding
bass
is
little
weak
at
lower
volumes
but
great
at
louder
volumesnot
overwhelming
as
have
realized
do
have
to
crank
up
the
volume
bit
more
through
my
phone
on
these
than
with
other
earbuds,
but
thats
okit
is
plenty
loud
these
have
become
my
new
favorites
and
has
changed
the
way
listen
to
music
permanently
don't
know
how
these
fly
under
the
radar
on
so
many
headset
reviews
the
only
knock
against
them
i've
generally
seen
is
the
price
the
good
news
is
these
are
worth
the
premium
battery
life
is
phenomenal
sound
quality
surpasses
all
other
true
wireless
earbuds
i've
found
these
are
the
closest
to
nice
pair
of
over
ear
cans
i've
used
the
passive
noise
isolation
cuts
out
lot
of
noise
thanks
to
the
numerous
fit
combinations
of
ear
tips
and
fins
tried
the
sony
noise
cancelling
buds
but
they
wouldn't
stay
in
very
long,
unlike
these
m&d
earbuds
can
wear
these
for
extended
periods
of
time
comfortably
and
they
stay
put
adding
in
the
active
noise
cancellation
drowns
out
the
hvac
and
background
humming
of
the
office
environment
having
physical
controls
on
the
buds
themselves
is
also
huge
bonus
the
buds
themselves
look
and
feel
premium,
the
materials
are
top
notch
the
case
is
oh
so
shiney
and
yes
it
is
fingerprint
magnet
find
myself
treating
it
like
nice
piece
of
jewelry
always
polishing
it
as
pointed
out
by
lot
of
people
it
does
scratch
easy
but
find
that
part
of
the
appeal
the
light
scratches
have
given
it
nice
look
call
quality
has
also
been
better
than
anticipated,
easily
beating
my
old
daily
drive
galaxy
buds
and
my
gym
rat
unit
jabra
elite
active
0t
i've
been
impressed
enough
with
the
performance
actually
plan
on
replacing
my
jabras
with
the
m&w
go
next
also
the
range
is
incredible
can
leave
my
phone
on
one
end
of
my
house
and
keep
stable
connection
for
music
and
calls
throughout
my
home
the
one
small
complaint
have
is
even
though
you
can
use
either
bud
by
itself
you
have
to
actually
pair
both
buds
to
do
this
whichever
one
you
take
out
first
will
end
up
being
the
parent
and
the
opposite
will
be
slaved
to
that
bud
just
leave
the
right
as
the
parent
bud
this
is
unlike
the
galaxy
buds
which
pairs
both
buds
and
you
can
freely
use
either
one
this
is
honestly
small
complaint
in
comparison
to
how
great
everything
else
is
on
these
buds
yes
these
are
expensive,
as
said
in
the
beginning
you
truly
get
what
you
pay
for
in
terms
of
excellent
build
and
audio
performance
use
these
things
almost
all
the
time
if
i'm
at
my
pc
or
walking
around
my
apartment
its
always
in
range
of
my
pc's
bluetooth
antenna
only
cutting
out
when
run
the
microwave
expected
i've
never
had
any
other
wireless
earbuds
so
cannot
comment
on
how
they
compare
to
the
competition
but
they
have
never
died
on
me
throughout
the
day
and
only
get
uncomfortable
with
them
in
my
ear
if
wear
them
for
around
0+
hoursi
plan
to
buy
some
different
tips
to
remedy
this
but
it
is
long
time
that
have
to
wear
them
for
them
to
bother
me
and
most
people
don't
leave
earbuds
in
for
that
long
imagine
haha
noise
cancelling
isn't
the
greatest
but
do
have
to
turn
it
off
to
drive
my
car
manual
otherwise
do
not
know
when
to
shift
so
it
definitely
isn't
the
worstthe
steel
charging
case
does
scratch
easily
as
i'm
sure
others
have
mentioned
the
only
major
gripe
that
have
with
the
whole
purchase
is
that
the
canvas
carrying
bag
it
came
with
has
metal
inserts
to
keep
the
top
shut
after
about
month
of
using
the
bag
lot
and
carrying
it
in
my
pocket
the
metal
inserts
cut
through
the
canvas
and
started
to
hurt
my
fingersi
threw
it
out
and
they
are
sending
me
new
one
but
imagine
will
have
the
same
issue
again
unless
am
much
more
careful
with
it
overall
my
favorite
purchase
of
update:
after
couple
weeks
of
use
i'm
convinced
these
are
the
best
sounding
truly
wireless
buds
when
paired
with
aptx
and
streaming
source
with
hd
or
ultra
hd
music
i've
gotten
used
to
having
to
turn
on
noise
cancelation
each
time
use
the
buds
still
wish
they
slightly
more
comfortable
and
may
try
some
other
combinations
of
tips
and
wings
or
grab
some
tips
from
another
brand
of
headphones
would
give
these
solid
if
audio
clarity
is
your
number
one
interestafter
lot
of
research,
purchased
the
mw0
plus
to
replace
failing
pair
of
first
gem
b&o
e0
truly
wireless
buds
i've
just
received
these
headphones
so
pls
expect
an
update
after
few
weekspros:
sound
is
incredible
better
than
e0
whose
sound
was
superior
to
most
other
buds
battery
life
is
impressive
beautiful
design
of
both
buds
and
case
comfortable
and
snug
fit
take
the
time
to
figure
out
the
right
size
combo
for
your
ears
use
the
xs
tips
and
the
medium
wings
easy
pairing
and
automatic
repairing
assuming
you
use
single
device
ambient
mode
is
good
but
you
need
to
pause
your
media
to
take
full
advantage
of
itcons:
no
app
to
refine
settings
and
update

noise
cancelation
behavior
is
very
not
intuitivemore
on
noise
cancelation:
by
default,
it's
turned
off
every
time
you
grab
your
buds
from
the
case
you
have
to
turn
it
on
manually
if,
however,
you
turn
switch
ambient
mode
on/off,
noise
cancellation
also
switches
off
you
then,
have
to
turn
this
feature
back
on
again
this
seems
like
very
strange
product
decision
on
interaction
now
that
understand
this,
can
work
around
it
but
m&d
could
have
saved
us
whole
lot
of
trouble
by
just
defaulting
noise
cancellation
onmore
to
come
i've
been
waiting
couple
years
to
upgrade
my
wireless
earbuds
hoping
for
something
amazing
to
come
out
however,
couldn't
wait
any
longer
the
reality
is
there
is
no
perfect
product
at
this
point
if
you're
an
audiophile
your
options
are
extremely
limited
so
far
these
seem
like
the
best
option
available
the
sound
is
amazing
lifelong
musician

appreciates

the
battery
lasted
me
an
entire
month
of
regular
use
on
first
charge,
matching
their
hour
claim
little
bit
less
on
subsequent
charges
but
still
good
don
use
the
noise
canceling
or
ambient
listening
modes
but
did
test
them
in
the
office
and
could
notice
the
difference
and
they
both
did
what
they
purported
range
is
something
around
0ft
from
my
phone
overall,
starsnow
my
gripes
first,
the
cloth
pouch
does
not
last
long
the
metal
strips
cut
through
the
cloth
opening
and
it
just
can
handle
frequent
use
wish
they
would
both
strengthen
this
pouch
as
well
as
sell
individual
pouch
replacements
as
opposed
to
having
to
buy
the
charging
case
too
once
they
break
like
this
it
basically
renders
them
unusable
bring
on
the
case
scratches
second,
the
rubber
wings
don
seem
to
last
very
long
and
lose
their
ability
to
tightly
grip
onto
the
earbud
every
single
time
pull
them
out
of
my
ears,
the
wing
partially
peels
off
this
also
blocks
the
optical
sensor,
causing
it
to
think
you
ve
placed
it
back
in
your
ear
and
it
then
restarts
audio
bought
replacement
wing
pack
but
wish
they
allow
us
to
buy
only
the
size
we
need
in
bulk
as
opposed
to
one
pair
of
all
the
sizes
would
recommend
buying
extra
wings
as
this
started
happening
after
about
months
of
use
lastly,
apparently
have
small
ears
so
the
smallest
wings
are
little
too
big
for
my
ear
concha
and
still
experience
ear
fatigue
after
leaving
them
in
for
more
than
an
hourso,
these
are
awesome
but
not
perfect
happy
with
the
purchase
and
would
buy
againm&d:
if
you
read
this
please
sell
us
bulk
singlesize
packs
of
wings
and
the
pouch
by
itselfgoodnight,
michelle
love
love

master
&
dynamic
that
said,
have
to
be
honest,
was
so
sad
had
to
return
these
particular
earbuds
first
had
the
original
mx0s
that
needed
to
replace
for
some
very
minor
reason
figured
it
would
be
good
reason
tonupgarde
to
the
plus
for
an
earbud,
sound
quality
is
really
great
by
design,
noise
reduction
is
not
bad
either
the
really
cool
thing
about
master
&
dynamic
is
how
they
stand
out
in
design
with
all
the
different
styles
of
truly
wireless
earbuds
in
the
market,
these,
by
far,
are
the
best
looking
quality
of
craftsmanship
is
apparent
the
downside,
had
to
return
the
plus
for
one
reason
the
casing
has
been
made
larger
than
it's
predecessor
that
they
would
not
even
sit
inside
my
ears
anymore
my
ears
are
on
the
smaller
side
that
the
original
mx0s
barely
sit,
but,
with
the
plus,
the
tips
are
the
only
things
that
fit
even
after
taking
off
the
wings,
the
earbuds
were
too
big
for
that
reason
alone,
had
to
revert
back
to
the
original
mx0
the
fit
is
for
average
to
larger
sizes
ears
otherwise,
for
those
looking
for
quality,
great
sounding,
and
tastefully
designed
earbuds
and
wouldn't
mind
being
magnificently
different
from
the
crowd,
and
if
price
is
not
an
issue,
these
earbuds
are
the
ones
to
buy
you
will
not
be
disappointed
my
main
point
of
comparison
here
is
the
sennheiser
momentum
true
wireless
earphones
also,
highly
recommend
using
the
comply
smartcore
tips
with
these
makes
the
sound
and
active
noise
cancellation
betteri
must
say
that
it
took
me
few
days
to
get
used
to
the
different
sound
signature
on
these,
as
they
are
significantly
more
airy
and
don't
have
exactly
the
same
rumbling
bass/subbass
however,
having
become
accustomed
to
these,
actually
prefer
the
mw0
sound
signature,
as
it
works
better
with
more
types
of
music
also,
they
still
have
very
good
bass,
just
not
quite
as
deep
as
the
sennheiser
overall,
would
say
these
are
more
balanced,
but
still
sound
funthe
battery
life
is
spectacular
have
never
even
come
close
to
running
out
of
battery
in
my
earphones
or
the
case,
and
use
them
every
day
walking
to
class
at
college
and
while
studying
charge
the
chase
maybe
once
every
two
weeks,
but
it
could
probably
last
month
incredible
the
case
is
easily
small
enough
to
fit
in
my
front
pocketthe
noise
cancellation
certainly
works
but
isn't
as
good
as
the
airpod
pros
it
does
good
enough
job,
though,
especially
with
constant
noise
it
also
doesn't
affect
battery
life
the
passthrough
is
also
good,
no
lag
it's
little
more
electrical
sounding
than
the
sennheisers,
which
are
truly
exceptional,
but
certainly
goodmy
single
complaint
about
these
would
be
the
lack
of
an
app,
but
honestly,
don't
miss
it
the
earphones
work
well
on
their
own
they
look,
fit,
and
sound
great,
and
they
have
the
best
battery
life
of
anything
in
their
class
as
far
as
i'm
aware
sounds
really
really
good
takes
sometime
to
burn
in
but
once
they
do
the
sound
is
natural
and
not
lacking
in
bass
source
material
is
important
so
dont
listen
to
badly
engineered
songs
then
blame
the
earphones
these
aren
going
to
hide
flaws
like
lesser
headphones
can
do
also
fit
in
your
ears
directly
effects
the
tonal
balance
so
take
time
to
find
the
right
wings
and
tips
for
your
ears
the
sound
should
be
natural
and
little
warm
with
taught
bass
take
the
time
to
set
them
up
properly
before
you
judge
took
couple
listening
sessions
and
adjustments
for
me
to
get
that
wow
moment
have
felt
cursed
with
ear
buds
my
shure
wired
bluetooth
earbuds
have
worked
the
best,
but
the
cord
which
is
between
to
bucks
has
to
be
replaced
yearly
it
seems
if
it
falls
within
warranty
period,
shure
is
great
about
replacing
but
if
falls
outside
you
have
to
buy
it
yet
again
they
do
have
new
addition
to
turn
them
into
true
wirelessi
purchased
this
pair
and
the
smaller,
slightly
less
expensive
go
model
loved
the
smaller
ones
but
two
weeks
in
they
stopped
connecting
to
every
device
in
my
possession
some
of
the
comments
here
reflect
that
experienceafter
deciding
to
return
the
go
earbud
for
replacement,
opened
these
to
try
them
outi
was
so
surprised
at
how
much
larger
these
were
in
comparision
to
the
go
model
one
of
the
great
things
about
the
&
earbuds
is
that
they
provide
many
sizes
of
ends
from
xs
to
xl,
so
you
can
get
the
best
fit
possible
take
the
small
ends
but
thought
my
outer
ear
just
average
in
size
they
simply
wouldn't
fit
in
my
ear
they
overlapped
the
back
edge
of
my
ear
which
meant
there
was
nothing
to
hold
them
in
place
and
the
mere
act
of
standing
up
resulted
in
one
coming
out
luckily
caught
it
as
result
can't
review
the
performance
other
than
in
general
across
the
entire
product
linethe
originals
and
now
cheapest
pair
of
m&w
earbuds
are
simply
horrid
they
have
poor
reception,
don't
hold
charge
and
otherwise
needed
improvementwith
the
addition
of
the
go
and
this
model
all
the
issues
have
been
resolved
in
terms
of
battery
life
and
reception
they
are
vastly
superior
the
ss
case
these
come
in
will
be
like
your
refrigerator
and
show
every
finger
print
so
plan
on
cleaning
they
do
have
fabric
travel
case
to
protect
the
hard
case
but
there
is
no
getting
around
handling
the
charging
casethe
go
0s
held
charge
fabulously
both
the
ear
buds
and
the
charging
cases
operated
as
advertised
suspect
this
set
would
have
exceeded
even
morethe
ergonomics
just
make
sense
when
you
design
ear
buds
where
there
is
solid
surface
about
the
size
of
nickel
and
taps
at
various
locations
or
the
number
of
taps
is
responsible
for
function
changes
volume,
track
forward/back
etc
you
are
going
to
mess
up
constantly
it
is
far
better
ergonomics
to
have
dedicated
buttons
to
push
that
is
easily
felt
with
your
fingers
while
in
the
ear
such
as
you
have
here
yes
the
power
button
has
dual
features
as
if
you
hold
it
down
longer
you
can
manually
pair,
but
that
isn't
something
you
are
going
to
accidentally
do
so
a+
on
ergonomics
in
design
while
the
trend
is
away
from
mechanical
design
elements
and
towards
"touch"
controls
or
voice
controls,
hope
that
the
good
old
fashioned
button
will
remain
as
it
is
far
easier
to
use
particularly
if
like
me
you
have
difficulties
where
loss
of
sensation
makes
touch
difficult
or
you
frequently
wear
gloves
which
really
makes
the
touch
controls
pain
am
going
to
try
the
"voice"
control
as
am
trying
to
get
used
to
alexa,
but
if
my
record
with
the
echo
holds
true
there
will
be
much
cursing
involved
in
the
learning
processa
problem
the
brand
has
overall
is
the
lack
of
customer
support
if
you
have
question
or
are
having
an
issue,
there
is
an
email
address
where
from
the
language
once
you
supply
them
with
verification
that
you
are
under
warranty
they
will
replace
defective
set
but
could
find
no
tech
help
line,
or
even
blog
page
where
customers
could
post
questions/answers
and
get
help
from
others
who
own
the
same
productamazon's
product
help
line
has
in
my
experience
been
limited
to
what
you
can
find
in
the
troubleshooting
guide
from
the
manufacturer
this
has
disappointed
me
greatly
because
have
already
checked
out
that
information
before
sought
help
from
amazoni
liked
this
design
better
than
any
other
ear
bud
have
owned
of
similarly
priced
earbuds
these
are
the
top
of
the
line
and
definitely
attractive
there
is
still
room
for
improvement
as
think
most
people
will
find
the
positioning
of
this
one
to
be
bit
awkward
making
this
model
slightly
smaller
in
size
would
improve
the
fit
and
overall
look
while
worn
they
are
far
more
attractive
then
most
earbuds
and
appreciate
the
number
of
color
choicesif
you
have
the
$,
would
recommend
these
but
keep
in
mind
that
there
have
not
been
sufficient
reviews
yet
to
determine
whether
they
hold
up
long
term
or
not
am
giving
them
0'
stars
but
they
may
prove
to
be
star
product
with
the
addition
of
technological
support
from
the
company
oh
man
the
sound
quality
on
these
buds
is
absolutely
amazing
have
not
owned
earbuds
or
headphones
over
$0
before
using
these,
and
gotta
say
it's
like
listening
to
music
for
the
first
time
these
babies
are
crisp
and
you
will
hear
sounds
you
have
never
heard
in
songs
before
in
fact,
few
times
freaked
out
from
background
noise
in
song
because
thought
it
was
actually
happening
around
me
lolso
why
the
stars
if
the
sound
is
so
great
and
battery
life
is
excellent
the
wearability
of
these
earbuds
is
terrible
they
have
never
felt
like
they
have
fit
right
have
tried
every
bud
and
wing
size,
and
have
even
ordered
spares
because
thought
they
was
an
issue
with
my
original
set
after
awhile
short
time
honestly
few
weeks
or
so
the
wings
start
to
slip
on
the
buds
and
can
fall
out
of
your
ear
like
said
even
ordered
replacements
and
tried
literally
all
sizes,
and
had
the
same
issue
on
the
replacements
compare
these
to
the
$0
anker
soundcore
pro's
which
feel
and
fit
amazing
compared
to
these
square
$0
turds
now
the
soundcore
pro's

amazing,
but
the
sound
quality
is
not
even
in
the

to
make

correct

totally
change
how

when

used
the

that
were

with
the

bass
was
absent,
didn
sound
that
great
once
went
down
size
and
got
them
down
into
my

it
was
much
better
sounding
will
say,
wish
they
got
little
louderhowever,
for
what
m&d
does
right
in
sound
and
design,
their
customer
service
is
in
need
of
improvement
had
the
sennheiser
momentum
true
wireless
before
these
and
have
to
say,
sennheiser
customer
service
is
so
much
better
than
master
and
dynamic
had
an
issue
with
the
sennheiser
battery
before
sending
them
back
for
these
and
their
customer
service
answers
the
phone
and
helps
you
address
an
issuei
had
problem
with
the
bluetooth
call
quality
with
the
first
pair
of
the
master
and
dynamic
still
have
yet
to
receive
phone
call
back
from
m&d
no
available
representatives
also
tried
sending
an
email
nothing
stars
for
the
earbuds,
zero
for
their
joke
of
customer
service
response
let
me
just
start
by
saying
that
have
very
specific
needs
when
it
comes
to
earbuds
good
sound
quality
is
must,
of
course
am
an
artist,
so
do
lot
of
visual
work
throughout
the
day
and
like
to
have
music
or
videos
playing
in
the
background
therefore,
need
battery
life
that
allows
me
to
listen
to
audio
nonstop
for
an
entire
work
day
and
as
someone
with
sensitive
ears,
comfort
is
extremely
important
the
mw0's
check
all
three
of
these
boxesi'm
not
an
audiophile,
but
can
appreciate
great
sound
quality,
and
these
offer
some
of
the
best
sound
have
every
heard
bass
is
very
present,
but
not
overwhelming,
and
the
overall
clarity
of
the
audio
is
outstanding
also
have
preference
for
punchy
and
vibrant
audio,
which
these
definitely
deliver
onbattery
life
is
amazing,
period
although
was
never
able
to
squeeze
out
the
0hrs
they
promised,
on
an
average
day,
could
get
up
to
hours
on
these,
playing
audio
nonstop
to
top
it
off,
it
only
takes
minutes
to
fully
charge
these
back
up
therefore,
if
i'm
ever
in
situation
where
need
my
battery
is
low,
can
simply
take
minute
break
and
come
back
with
another
hours
of
juice
amazingthe
comfort
can
be
hit
or
miss
with
most
people
for
me,
after
several
days
of
trying
out
the
different
tips
and
fins,
have
concluded
that
the
best
fit
would
be
the
large
tips
with
no
fins
even
without
fins,
the
mw0's
are
surprisingly
secure
and
can
wear
these
for
hours
without
any
sort
of
ear
fatiguebest
pair
of
true
wireless
earbuds
have
ever
tried,
hands
down
fully
recommend
these
to
anyone
who
has
the
money
to
pay
for
premium
earbuds
granted
they
don't
need
earbuds
specifically
for
ancsome
cons
to
note:noise
cancellation
and
ambient
sound
aren't
the
best,
but
they're
functionalcase
is
beautiful,
but
fingerprint
magnet
also
scratches
very
easily
my
case
had
micro
scratches
within
the
first
day
of
use,
just
from
me
setting
it
down
on
my
wooden
deskbluetooth
hissing
sound
is
still
present
as
is
the
case
in
every
pair
of
bluetooth
earbuds
have
triedsmall
ringing
sound
in
the
right
ear
after
audio
has
been
paused
for
0+
minute
only
audible
in
completely
quiet
environment
also
have
very
sensitive
ears
and
can
pick
up
on
very
quite
sounds,
so
most
people
might
not
notice
this
at
all
tried
these
earbuds
for
roughly
week
to
see
how
would
feel
was
hesitant
to
buy
these,
because
had
my
doubts
they
would
stack
up
to
wired
earbuds
such
as
my
etymotic
research
er0xr
these
earbuds
furthered
my
doubtsthe
sound
quality
is
solid,
but
not
mindblowing
it's
detailed,
but
the
highs
are
pretty
scratchy
they
are
awful
for
watching
youtube
videos
because
any
"s"
sounds
would
be
exhausting
to
listen
tothe
features
on
the
earbuds
are
questionable
as
well
it
gets
really
old
having
to
fiddle
with
the
left
earbud
every
time
want
to
turn
on
anc
especially
since
it's
so
weak,
it
feels
like
it's
not
meant
to
be
major
feature
the
pairing
is
very
inconsistent
as
well,
as
felt
forced
to
pair
through
my
phone
about
0%
of
the
time
i'm
using
samsung
galaxy
note0,
which
supports
bluetooth
and
all
thatthe
connection
is
maddeningly
inconsistent
every
time
i'd
turn
my
head
to
the
right,
the
music
would
skip
and
stutter
that
makes
listening
to
music
while
walking
very
frustrating
affair
as
can't
watch
for
traffic
or
look
around
without
dealing
with
skips
for
$0
would
expect
better
connection
qualityi'm
returning
these
and
i'm
giving
them
0star
in
the
offchance
that
had
bum
pair
wouldn't
recommend
these
to
anyone
buyer
beware
this
is
my
very
first
set
of
wireless
earbuds
and
think
chose
wisely
only
have
had
these
for
less
than
months
now
but
happy
with
them
so
farnot
the
most
expensive
but
definitely
not
the
cheapest
either
definitely
high
quality
brand
and
it's
the
marble
color
that
really
grabs
attentionm&d
mw0s
sound
great
with
exceptional
noise
cancellation
and
are
rain/sweat
proof
suppose
if
go
out
on
boat
on
lake
michigan
and
accidentally
drop
in
the
water
then
guess
i'm
sol
can't
scuba
dive
with
them
either,
oh
darnno
they're
not
waterproof
but
who
cares,
just
look
at
these
bad
boys
it's
the
craftsmanship,
excellent
sound
as
well
as
noise
cancellation
and
battery
life
that
matters
the
most
time
will
tell
with
product
quality/longevityi'm
bit
of
an
electronics
enthusiast
so
in
years
after
the
insurance
plan
expires
i'll
probably
end
up
going
with
something
else
up
to
date
that's
highly
rated
anyways
if
they
don't
last
always
fun
to
explore
the
latest
technology
took
several
tries
to
get
all
the
fit
options
figured
out
i've
worn
them
for
hours
playing
music
continously
wonderful
frequency
response
thanks
to
the
beryllium
drivers
normally
found
in
high
end
stereo
speakers
bass
is
easily
heard
as
is
the
highest
synthesizer
note
they
have
few
issues
noise
canceling
is
minimum
which
actually
extends
battery
life
i'll
take
the
extra
battery
life
each
bud
controls
different
things
which
confuses
some
people
all
earbuds
have
trade
offs
too
many
people
complain
about
the
trade
offs
these
headphones
are
awesome
really
amazing
sound
quality
and
very
easy
bluetooth
pairing
for
fantastic
and
simplistic
listening
on
the
go
the
headphones
came
with
few
different
sized
ear
attachments
so
was
able
to
find
the
perfect
and
most
comfortable
fit
to
my
ears
this
allowed
for
remarkable
noise
cancelling
properties
and
they
didn
budge
even
during
aggressive
workouts
long
lasting
battery
life
and
really
easy
indicators
to
show
when
they
need
charge
overall
they
are
far
superior
to
similar
products
and
would
definitely
recommend
as
the
title
states,
these
are
awesome
earbuds
compared
to
the
airpod
pros,
they
are
little
larger
but
the
sound
quality
and
battery
life
are
so
much
better
and
they
feel
premium,
unlike
some
other
brands,
due
to
the
acetate
used
for
the
shell
the
case
is
solid,
but
it
is
shiny
so
it
will
attract
finger
prints
but
you
aren
showing
the
case
off
so
it
doesn
really
matter
will
be
purchasing
another
pair
for
myself
since
my
wife
took
these
love
these
sound
quality
is
so
good
it
is
hard
to
beat
have
tried
several
ear
buds
but
none
sound
as
good
anc
not
great
but
if
you
don't
expect
it
to
be
great
and
just
listen
to
the
sound
you
will
fall
in
love
have
tried
so
many
earbuds
that
hurt
or
just
didn't
sound
good
use
these
over
my
over
the
ear
cans
because
they
sound
that
good
can't
use
the
wing
tips
bit
with
these
you
can
just
take
them
off
the
product's
battery
life
is
insane
which
up
to
0+
hours
with
anc
no,
but
sound
quality
is
great
when
loud,
but
it
might
become
sallow
when
at
earsafe
volume
indeed,
anc
is
not
effective
to
block
out
noise
come
from
twoperson
conversation
when
your
volume
is
set
below
0,
and
becomes
loud,
although
ambient
noise
is
functional
,
yet,
there
is
no
app
to
customize
any
settings,
which
is
standalone
product
with
no
sound
customizations
or
update
tested
three
different
true
wireless
headsets
sennheiser,
sony,
and
m&dsound
is
subjective
and
people
like
different
amounts
of
bass
etc
they
all
sound
really
good
the
sony
has
bit
more
bass
than
like
the
sony's
don't
have
aptx
or
even
sony's
ldac
the
sennheiser
sounded
real
good
but
the
soundstage
was
bit
more
separated
they
support
aptx
they
sounded
on
par
with
the
m&d
the
m&d
sounds
to
be
the
best
with
the
better
soundstage
good
punch
with
bass
and
clear
mids
and
highs
like
said
sound
is
subjective
and
also
depends
on
the
recording
and
the
device
you
are
usingthe
decision
to
keep
the
m&d
came
down
to
controls,
comfort
and
batter
life
my
ears
are
little
weird
and
don't
do
good
with
inear
headphones
stayed
with
over
the
ear
headphones
but
over
the
head
earphones
hurt
my
head
lot
with
glasses
and
my
ears
getting
hot
the
m&d
have
wings
to
help
keep
the
earphone
in
place
better
which
is
good
for
me
the
sony's
were
ok
but
kept
on
sliding
out
on
one
ear
the
sennheiser
just
hurt
my
earthe
controls
on
the
m&d
are
ok
they
could
be
better
as
far
as
not
being
button
but
touch
control
like
the
other
don
know
if
they
went
that
way
to
save
space
or
less
issues
the
buttons
work
fine
but
you
have
to
hold
the
headphone
to
use
them
not
an
issue
as
got
use
to
itall
in
all
they
are
great
pair
of
headphones
expensive
compare
to
sony
but
you
get
what
you
pay
for
there
not
cheap
but
worth
every
dime
great
sound,
as
custom
fit
as
you
can
ask
for
with
all
the
fins
and
accessories,
great
battery
life
and
again,
that
wonderful
m&d
sound
if
you
want
music
and
not
midrange
noise
in
your
ear,
grab
these
buds
and
then
enjoy
them
all
day
long
was
hesitant
to
drop
this
much
cash
but
it
was
worth
it
the
sound
quality
is
great
and
wear
them
around
the
house
while
doing
chores
and
forget
that
have
them
in
do
use
them
to
work
out
at
the
gym
and
have
never
had
an
issue
with
them
moving
or
feeling
like
they
might
fall
out
easy
to
connect
to
different
devices
read
the
directions
nice
metal
box
that
charges
the
earphones
keep
the
metal
box
in
the
pouch
so
when
you
pop
out
the
silver
box,
it
looks
great
sound
canceling
is
fine
and
can
hear
the
differencemy
only
complaint
is
that
depending
on
what
you
are
listening
to,
the
music
is
sometimes
not
loud
enough
and
can
not
get
them
louder
that
would
be
at
the
gym,
plenty
loud
at
home
use
an
ipod
mostly
to
listen
to
them
with
all
loudness
restrictions
off
would
recommend
getting
these
earphones,
knowing
what
put
above
these
are
awesome
can
be
worn
all
day
with
no
discomfort
excellent
battery
life
and
with
the
case
you'll
never
be
without
tunes
in
your
ears
around
mins
for
full
charge
is
an
achievement
audiophile
sound
quality
as
good
as
alot
of
over
the
ear
phones
i'm
glad
purchased
them
makes
my
commutes
and
workouts
all
the
better
and
like
these
so
much
got
my
sister
and
girlfriend
pair
of
the
go
model
and
they
love
theres
as
well
you
won't
be
disappointed
some
claim
about
connectivity
issues
don't
see
what's
so
hard
about
having
to
click
button
when
you
switch
devices
mean
it's
really
very
simple
but
some
people
can't
be
satisfied
no
matter
what
they
get
i've
had
these
little
less
than
year
ago,
and
while
the
battery
life
is
incomparable,
seriously,
feel
like
never
have
to
charge
them,
it's
wonderful
be
that
as
it
may,
have
tried
all
the
different
ear
wings
and
tips
and
can't
get
good
fit
don't
have
oddly
shaped
ears
or
canals
that
am
aware
of,
but
these
are
heavy,
probably
the
heaviest
of
true
wireless
earbuds,
and
think
it
is
this
weight
that
prevents
good
fit
additionally,
when
it
comes
to
noise
isolation
or
sound
quality,
have
to
adjust
the
earbuds
every
few
minutes
to
ensure
good
seal,
otherwise,
these
will
let
all
the
exterior
sounds
in
tied
into
the
exterior
sound,
yes,
they
do
come
with
anc,
but
with
poor
fit,
anc
is
useless,
however
even
with
temporary
good
fit,
the
anc
is
basically
indistinguishable
on
or
off
the
anc
really
just
mellows
out
some
sharp
sounds,
but
it
doesn't
really
cancel
any
noise
as
for
the
bt,
it
works
okay,
find
it
works
when
walking
around
away
from
the
source
for
upwards
of
ft
that
being
said,
get
frequent
drops/inconsistency
in
connection
when
the
source
is
in
my
pocketphone,
which
makes
no
sensein
conclusion,
the
fit,
weight,
and
lack
of
astounding
sound
quality,
aren't
made
up
by
the
looks
and
battery
think
if
you
are
looking
for
truly
wireless
earbuds,
get
the
airpod
pros
or
the
sony
looks
aside,
the
performance
and
fit
easily
beat
out
the
mw0+
if
it
were
possible,
i'd
return
these
and
get
the
airpods
pro
after
seeing
some
prominent
people
wearing
these
on
tv,
decided
to
give
them
try
expected
far
more
from
master
&
dynamic
these
are
so
brittle
and
harsh
that
they
literally
hurt
my
ears
the
sound
is
not
well
balanced
at
all
gave
them
bit
of
breaking
in
period,
but
it
got
no
better,
so
returned
them
these
may
look
nice,
but
the
sound
will
drive
you
crazy
if
you
are
an
audiophile
honestly,
they
perform
worse
than
some
$0
earphones
think
have
purchased
or
pairs
of
earbuds
over
the
last
few
years,
these
are
the
best
worth
every
penny
sound
quality
is
better
then
samsung,
jabra,
b&o,
and
any
of
the
cheep
under
$0
earbuds
that
use
for
outside
work
often
have
the
left
one
in
use
for
music
or
audio
books
for
or
hours
at
stretch
very
comfortable
after
some
trial
and
error
looking
for
the
right
combination
of
tip
and
wingi
love
these
and
have
used
them
every
day
since
they
arived
sound
quality
is
wonderful
they
fit
super
comfortably
and
snug
once
changed
the
fins
and
buds
to
the
largest
sizes
although
the
the
noise
cancelling
is
basically
non
existent,
the
overall
quality
of
the
headphones
compensate
would
recommend
to
anyone
looking
for
premium
wireless
bluetooth
buds
bought
these
after
researching
around
and
am
extremely
happy
with
my
decision
the
noise
cancellation
is
great
and
feel
submersed
in
whatever
am
consuming
audio
books,
streaming
videos,
spotify,
etc
the
case
is
awesome
and
the
battery
holds
charge
for
very
very
long
time
the
design
is
easy
to
carry
around
and
the
ear
pieces
fit
comfortably
in
my
ears
other
brands
have
not
fit
as
well
or
hurt
after
while
these
are
easily
the
best
headphones
have
ever
purchased
stars
highly
recommended
wanted
something
for
working
out
and
using
in
coffee
shops
or
places
where
my
over
ear
headphones
aren
convenient
these
have
great
sound,
look
nice
though
it
took
me
while
to
get
used
to
the
unique
shape
without
feeling
self
conscious
in
public,
even
though
airpods
are
worn
by
tons
of
people
with
no
apparent
similar
qualms,
have
incredible
battery
life,
and
are
easy
to
control
with
physical
buttons
for
volume,
noise
cancellation,
track
pausing
and
skipping
don
really
use
the
ambient
sound
feature
much
if
at
all,
but
do
use
the
noise
cancellation
feature
it
not
great,
but
in
certain
surroundings
it
is
noticeable
improvement
the
very
best
have
ever
owned
killer
fit,
no
problems
with
blue
tooth
range,
great
fitting
options
added
comply
foam
tips
as
do
with
all
my
ear
buds
for
the
perfect
seal
and
final
touch
in
ear
buds
own:
apple
airpods,
airpod
pro,
powerbeats,
bose,
jabra
and
ue
custom
these
are
at
the
top
buy
'em
the
audacity
that
this
company
has
to
price
these
pieces
of
garbage
for
$0
is
obsurd
wasted
my
money
with
these
ambient
mode
barely
works
as
it
sounds
noise
cancellation
is
also
terrible
and
doesn
cut
out
enough
noise
worst
buy
of
buy
airpod
pros
for
better
use
of
your
money
and
music
the
master
and
dynamic
mw0
plus
are
amazing
sounding
the
design
is
also
very
nice
and
doesn't
protrude
too
far
from
your
ears
the
active
noise
cancellation
is
decent
it
isn't
as
good
as
the
sony
wf0xm0's
two
reasons
for
only
giving
stars
they
are
very
expensive
and
am
having
an
issue
with
audio
and
visual
syncing
up
on
my
pixel
xl
my
samsung
galaxy
s0
edge
doesn't
have
this
problem
though
when
am
using
them
as
result
think
this
is
due
to
the
phone
and
headphones,
but
still
kind
of
annoying
great
headphones
overall
had
been
waiting
for
months
for
bose
to
release
their
new
true
wireless
noise
cancelling
earbuds
and
they
are
still
not
released
did
allot
of
research
and
purchased
these
based
on
few
forum
articles
had
read
these
are
comfortable,
stylish,
noise
cancelling
is
great
and
sound
is
really
good
use
these
while
travelling
and
for
conference
calls
great
not
having
cords
and
mic
in
your
face
on
conference
calls
and
small
package
to
carry
with
you
while
traveling
i've
had
these
for
months
and
the
sound
quality
and
most
everything
about
these
are
fantastic
my
chief
complaint
is
that
the
ear
wings
started
slipping
off
of
the
earbud
after
months
this
means
that
the
earbud
no
longer
stays
solidly
in
place
in
your
ear
effectively
removing
all
of
the
great
qualities
of
the
earbud
in
addition
they
want
you
to
pay
an
additional
$0
to
purchase
new
ones
who
want's
to
pay
$0
year
in
addition
to
already
high
cost
of
the
earbud
they
come
with
the
medium
ear
tip
installed
so
took
my
usual
mile
walk
and
felt
they
sounded
better
than
my
old
buds,
but
not
worth
the
price
paid
so
when
swapped
out
the
medium
to
small,
they
still
sounded
bit
tinny
installed
the
large
ear
tips,
world
of
difference,
much
more
full
sound
and
increased
bass
very
happy
with
my
choose
the
batteries
in
the
earbuds
stopped
holding
charge
after
months
when
wrote
in
to
get
replacement
they
let
me
know
the
batteries
are
only
guaranteed
for
days
what
joke
no
other
manufacturer
at
this
price
point
has
such
terrible
polkcy
to
add
insult
to
injury
all
they
offered
was
discount
for
future
purchase
will
never
buy
from
this
company
again
also,
if
you
are
thinking
of
using
them
for
working
out,
don't
bother,
any
major
movement
and
these
start
to
slip
out
would
absolutely
avoid
expensive,
but
very
high
quality
battery
life
and
case
is
tops
like
the
look,
but
the
comfort
of
it
in
my
ear
is
what
matters;
it
wins
there,
too
could
use
more
bass,
but
sound
is
great
and
can
hear
dang
thing
when
they
re
in
one
very
important
thing
is
that
the
two
buds
disconnected
from
each
other
often
and
that
was
quite
annoying
did
expect
little
bit
better
quality
on
the
sound
call
quality
in
coming
was
perfect
out
going
was
not
so
perfect
some
people
said
was
little
muffled
some
said
it
was
okay
and
some
said
sounded
like
was
very
far
away
in
tunnel
too
much
money
to
spend
on
disappointment
usually
find
earbuds
irritating
but
these
are
so
comfortable
can
barely
feel
them,
even
after
several
hours
got
the
white
and
love
the
way
they
look
the
sound
is
amazing,
battery
life
lasts
for
ages,
and
the
charging
case
is
small
and
feels
nice
to
hold
classy
really
happy
got
these
truly
enjoy
how
these
sound
very
neutral
but
not
lack
in
enjoyment
these
are
some
of
the
most
impressive
earbuds
that
you
can
findi
had
continential
flight
recently
and
the
anc
is
just
disappointing
it
bearly
do
anything
with
the
noise
had
to
use
the
bose
nc0
and
it
is
night
and
day
even
the
passive
noise
isolation
is
not
great
compared
to
everything
elsebattery
life
is
so
great
you
would
not
have
to
worry
about
it
just
amazing
no
matter
how
hard
try
cannot
get
agood
seal
with
these
even
with
extra
large
tips
and
large
wings
they
will
not
staysealed
ican
push
them
in
with
my
fingers
and
hold
them
in
and
they
sound
fantastic
but
as
soon
as
irelease
them
they
ease
out
just
enough
to
lose
seal
and
sound
leaks
and
lose
bass
and
that
kills
the
sound
quality
so
for
me
fit
seems
to
be
the
problem
love
these
excellent
sound,
easy
to
set
up,
and
the
earphones
can
be
used
one
at
time
the
fit
is
great
without
hurting
my
ear
or
having
ear
fatigue
highly
recommended
worth
the
price
turns
out
cant
wear
earbuds
but
they
he
customer
service
was
fabolous
even
in
these
difficult
times
these
are
great
earphones
easily
paired
and
reconnect
use
this
for
remote
meetings
and
phone
calls
no
issues
and
the
sound
quality
and
microphone
are
great
so
far,
love
these
earphones
have
only
had
them
short
while,
but
they
are
comfortable
to
wear
and
have
great
sound
have
not
had
them
long
enough
to
get
good
idea
how
well
the
noise
cancellation
mode
works,
but
the
ambient
mode
works
well
this
is
really
the
only
kind
of
wireless
earbud
i'd
consider
using
all
high
end
earbuds
cost
couple
hundred
dollars
but
in
all
honesty
these
are
the
only
ones
that
justify
the
price
really
nice
alternative
to
my
m&d
headphones
when
i'm
on
the
go
awesome
ear
buds
fit
great,
sound
awesome
just
pricey
amazing
use
them
everyday
great
for
workouts
and
tons
of
fittings
highly
recommend
,
wayyyy
better
than
the
airpod
pros
best
noise
canceling
earphones
on
the
market
ve
researched
for
while
these
are
the
best
for
the
money
my
husband
says
they
are
awesome
despite
what
the
specifications
say,
these
can
only
be
paired
to
one
device
at
time
you
have
to
manually
switch
between
them
by
putting
the
headphones
into
pairing
mode
absolutely
love
these
wireless
inear
earphones
the
only
thing
wish
was
better
is
the
noise
cancelling
tough
to
pair,
clumsy
fit
with
little
in
the
way
of
noise
cancellation
decent
sound,
but
waaay
too
big
high
quality,
comfortable,
deeeep
bass
they
are
awesome
really
love
them
good
quality
calls
sound
great
good
everything
was
as
expected,
personally
bit
difficult
to
find
the
right
fit
with
the
rubber
seal
these
are
awesome
great
sound
at
all
volume
levels
worked
for
about
month
now
have
paperweight
great
