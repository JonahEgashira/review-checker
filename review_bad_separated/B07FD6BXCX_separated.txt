!i
bought
this
mouse
to
replace
the
old
one
at
work.
at
first,
didn't
expect
much
because
of
the
cheap
price.
however,
the
product
really
surprised
me!
have
been
using
it
for
week,
at
it
works
perfectly.
the
appearance
is
elegant,
the
speed
is
smooth,
and
the
size
fits
my
hand.
the
only
little
minus
point
is
the
sound
when
click
the
button,
but
really
don't
mind
it.
not
sure
about
the
battery
consumption
yet
because
have
just
used
it
for
week.
anyway,
rate
it
5/5
and
really
recommend
it
to
anyone
in
need
of
basic
mouse!

it
connected
to
my
laptop
straight
away
love
how
the
little
usb
connector
was
in
small
compartment
underneath
which
is
great
if
you
travel
and
take
it
all
with
you
just
pop
it
back
in

no

of
it
being

then
connect
the
little
usb

that

it.

wireless

yesterday.
bear
in
mind
that
it
does
not
include

and
this
was
already

in
the
order
details.
the
instructions
were
very
clear
in
the
pack

how
to
remove
the
micro-receiver
from
the
mouse
and
inserted
this
to
my
pcthis
is
day

included
picture
of
the
mouse
on
the
mat.
i've
bought
couple
of
cheap
wireless
mice
over
the
years,
but
this
one
is
actually
pretty
good
compared
to
the
others.i've
had
tecknet
and
patuoxun
with
the
logo
-
both
were
too
small
for
my
hand
19x10cm.i
was
sceptical
at
for
this
jukstg
but
am
pleasantly
surprised.
light
weight,
nice
shape.clicks
are
little
loud,
and
it
does
have
cheap
plastic
feel.
but
7?
it's
great.might
purchase
another
as
gift
for
christmas.hard
to
say
what
it'll
be
like
for
gaming.
assume
it
has
low
polling
rate
etc.
but
for
basic
games
and
nothing
competitive
i'm
sure
it'll
be
fine.
edit:
polling
rate
seems
to
be
around
250..
pretty
low
and
super
noticeable
in
games
tested.
fine
for
very
casual
play,
but
nothing
like
shooter.
very
good
mouse
can
say
its
very
comfortable,
smooth
and
easy
to
use
it
saves
the
battery
and
turns
off
when
not
in
use
straight
away
only
click
away
and
its
awake
straight
away
overall
cracking
priced
stylish
computer

would
definately
recommened
this
to

people,
its
just
what
needed

very,very

:::
was
skeptical
about
this
mouse
given
the
price
paid
but
was
pleasantly
surprised
just
how
good
it
was!
one
of
my
pet
hates
in
mice
is
if
the
shell
feels
warm
or
unpleasant
to
the
touch,
so
the
smooth
exterior
was
relief
to
see.
matte
casings
are
ok
but
prefer
my
hand
be
able
to
breathe
when
using
it.
which
this
allows,
very
nicely.
the
size
is
overall
good,
slim
but
not
too
slim
and
decent
length.
would've
preferred
mouse
that's
little
more
full-size
i.e.
like
4cm
thick
but
that's
only
as
favour
claw-like
grip;
but
this
one
is
fine.
i've
used
mice
that
have
very
poor
in
this
regard
logitech's
pebble
mouse
is
one
i've
just
had
to
submit
return
for,
this
very
reason;
uncomfortably
thin!.
encountered
no
problems
when
connecting
and
there
were
no
droputs
or
anything,
all
fine
in
that
aspect
too.
so,
this
little
beauty
gets
my
vote
:
for
cheap
mouse
this
really
fitted
the
bill.
for
people
with
larger
hands
it
is
quite
wide
but
very
flat,
so
does
not
take
up
much
space
in
the
laptop
bag,
also
having
silent
click
is
good
when
in
the
company
of
others.a
good
product
at
good
price
very
nice
and
simple
mouse,
packaged
in
environmentally
friendly
cardboard.
very
easy
to
setup
and
use
-
just
remove
the
battery
cover,
insert
just
one
aa
battery
and
plug
in
the
usb
dongle
to
your
pc.
it's
plug
and
play
so
it
works
instantly.
excellent
value
for
money
and
fine
to
use.
happy
to
recommend
absolute
waste
of
money,
arrived
faulty,

missing

also
faulty
-
windows
wont
even
detect
it!!dont
waste
your
money!!!quality
is
poor,
feels
flimsy,
even
in
working
condition
it
would
be
over
priced
in
pound
shop!!ideal
item
for
taking
up
space
in
your
wheelie
bin!now
the
decision
-
do
waste
time
and
fuel
driving
to
drop
of
point
to
return
an
item
that
should
be
checked
prior
to
dispatch
or
do
just
bin
it
immediately
and
lose
my
money!
really
dont
understand
why
amazon

products,
only
deliver
them.

if

the

life
is

after

recommended.
this
was
an
absolutely
inspired
buy
...
my
old
mouse
was
playing
up
because
the
wire
was
bit
dodgy
so
thought
i'd
try
this
wireless
one.
it's
brilliant
and
found
it
really
simple
to
set
up
note:
am
not
the
most
technically
gifted
person.
it
was
so
reasonably
priced
can't
imagine
why
didn't
get
it
months
ago.
i'm
thrilled
to
bits
with
it
and
its
performance.
like
the
minimalist
design
and
that
the
mouse
wheel
is
perfectly
accurate.
many
mice
that
tried
suffer
from
poor
mouse
wheel,
e.g.
you
would
try
to
scroll
down
and
instead
the
page
would
jump
up
and
down.
this
one
has
perfect
mouse
wheel,
and
perfect
front/back
page
buttons.but
must
say
the
wireless
performance
is
pretty
bad.
it
keeps
losing
connection
and
then
reconnecting.
which
is
annoying
because
the
mouse
pointer
freezes
during
this.
and
it
sometimes
happens
several
times
per
minute.
it
also
drains
battery
pretty
quick
compared
to
some
other
mice.
had
requirement
to
work
from
home.i
already
have
wireless
mouse
in
office,
so
could
not
get
used
to
using
mouse
pad
on
laptop.so
decided
to
look
for
cost
effective
mouse
for
home
use.saw
the
reviews
and
decided
for
the
cost
there
was
little
to
loose.item
arrived
on
time
and
well
packed.no
battery
included
but
takes
standard
aa.added

wireless
sender
/
receiver
to
free
usb
report
and
mouse
worked
immediately.so
far
so
good,
works
well
and
is
exactley
what
needed.100%
recommend
i'm
really
pleased
with
this
mouse.
had
one
previously
which
was
slightly
smaller.
got
the
smaller
one
as
didn't
really
think
the
size
mattered...
:...
but
the
size
of
the
mouse
turned
out
to
give
me
wrist
problems
as
it
was
too
short.
this
one
is
much
better
as
the
heel
of
my
hand
fits
onto
the
back
of
the
mouse
which
means
my
wrist
is
at
more
ergonomic
angle.
the
mouse
is
light
and
easy
to
move
around
which
again
helps
with
any
rsi
issues.
would
recommend
this
mouse
as
excellent
value
for
money.
this
mouse
costs
less
than
but
delivers
everything
wanted
in
wireless
mouse.
it
connected
immediately
with
my
windows
10
pc
and
has
few
extra
features
that
did
not
have
in
my
previous
mouse,
such
as
the
front
and
back
button,
which
enables
you
to
move
"front"
and
"back"
in
browser.
even
though
have
not
obviously
used
it
long
enough
to
drain
the
battery,
rated
the
battery
life
as
5,
because
the
mouse
seems
to
switch
off
automatically
when
my
pc
goes
to
sleep
and
it
uses
single
aa
battery,
which
have
more
of
around
that
house
that
the
two
aaa
batteries
needed
for
my
previous
mouse.
all
in
all,
an
excellent
buy.
this
is
decent
mouse
for
it's
really
low
price.
wasn't
expecting
the
world,
but
it
does
the
job
well.
only
stars
because
i've
had
to
unplug
it
and
plug
it
in
to
get
it
to
re-connect
sometimes
-
but
at
this
price
tags
not
huge
problem.
it
fits
comfortably
in
the
hand
and
is
well
made.
they
are
very
affordable
and
probably
will
last
as
long
as
more
expensive
mouses,
in
my
experience,
and
in
my
opinion.
also,
very
easy
to
install
on
my
laptop.
the
only
minor
problem
had
was
removing
the
battery
cover
as
have
weak
nails,
but
with
the
use
of
very
small
screwdriver
was
able
to
remove
it
easy-peasy!
the
ordered
arrived
quickly.
setting
it
up
took
less
than
minute
and
worked
straightaway
with
mac
laptop.
however,
for
reasons
unknown
to
me,
it
cuts
itself
off
and
disconnects.
put
brant
new
battery
in
and
this
should
be
enough
to
get
the
mouse
going
for
months
supposedly
has
long
battery
life?!
am
really
frustrated
that
every
few
minutes
have
to
turn
it
on/off
to
get
the
connection
re-established.
is
this
the
greatest
mouse
you
will
ever
use?
no.but,
if
you
just
want
useable,
comfortable,
everyday
mouse
then
this
is
perfectly
good.
not
precise
enough
for
first
person
gaming,
but
if
you
were
expecting
it
to
be
at
this
price,
then
frankly
go
give
yourself
good
talking
to.if,
however
you
just
want
mouse
for
day
to
day
pc/laptop
use
and
have
no
intention
of
using
it
for
playing
call
of
duty,
then
this
mouse
is
amazing.
it
does
everything
you
expect
from
mouse
and
even
has
extra
buttons
for
going
forward
or
back
when
browsing
and
for
adjusting
the
dpi.at
this
price
why
wouldn't
you
buy
it?
this
is
wireless
mouse
for
less
than
the
price
of
large
coffee!
this
mouse
arrived
yesterday
and
was
the
quickest
set
up
imaginable.
plugged
in
the
do-dah
think
the
technical
term
may
be
receiver
but
i'm
not
very
technical
and
by
the
time
had
put
battery
into
the
mouse
everything
was
good
to
go.
it's
easy
and
comfortable
to
use.
it's
also
excellent
value
but
as
yet
can't
comment
on
the
battery
life.
was
annoyed
at
my
husband
for
dropping
my
last
mouse
but
after
receiving
this
one
and
using
for
only
few
minutes,
its
the
best
thing
he
ever
did.this
mouse
is
so
comfortable
,
have
arthritic
fingers
but
this
mouse
just
fits
under
my
hand
nicely.
it
is
very
responsive
and
all
the
buttons
work!i
am
so
pleased
bought
this.
the
first
few
weeks
this
worked
great
no
issues.
then
have
had
to
replace
the
battery
twice
and
now
no
matter
what
try
the
mouse
no
longer
connects
to
the
wireless
usb.
in
all
this
has
lasted
me
about
month
and
half.
disappointed,
and
now
am
going
to
have
to
try
and
find
another
replacement
and
more
unnecessary
money
to
pay.
bought
this
as
my
imac
that's
sat
for
years
with
internal
issue
wanted
to
clear
and
make
sure
no
data
can
be
accessible
once
trade/sell
it.
my
mac
mouse
just
won't
work.
so
bought
this
and
can
say
it
arrived
very
quickly
and
it
worked
instantly.
allowing
me
to
do
what
needed
to.
recommend
this
product
to
anyone.
purchased
this
for
my
father
to
use.
love
the
fact
that
the
wifi
usb
can
be
placed
within
compartment
in
the
mouse
itself.
it
is
easy
to
use
and
he
picked
up
how
to
use
it
very
easily.
it
feels
very
comfortable
in
your
had
and
is
comfortable
to
use.
am
thinking
of
getting
another
for
myself.
would
highly
recommend
it.
this
is
very
lightweight
even
when
there
is
battery.
good
bluetooth
connection.
feels
little
flimsy
though,
like
it
would
smash
into
thousand
little
mices.
not
used
it
for
gaming
yet
hence
the
no
stars
but
only
gave
3stars
for
battery
life
as
it
depends
on
what
battery
you
use.
according
to
the
advert,
the
battery
with
the
running
bunny
is
good
start.
just
got
this
so
can't
comment
on
battery
life,
like
the
on/off
switch
though
which
will
help
to
conserve
it.
can't
comment
on
gaming
either
as
don't
do
it.
very
easy
to
install,
anyone
can
do
it,
even
non-savvy
pc
folk
like
me!
seems
nice
to
use,
first
wireless
mouse
i've
had,
and
much
prefer
not
having
the
cable.
very
happy
with
this.
i'm
very
happy
with
my
new
"jukstg",
wireless
mouse.
its
slimline
design
fits
my
hand
and
is
very
comfortable
to
use.
so
far
it
has
functioned
perfectly,
the
quick
scroll
wheel
makes
zooming
up
or
down
web
page
simplicity
itself
and
the
"slow
scroll"
function
makes
reading
longer
articles
very
easy.
at
just
under
i'd
say
that
it
is
better
than
just
value
for
money
and
is
more
like
right
bargain.
i'm
very
happy
to
recommend
this
mouse
to
others.
you
can
spend
lot
of
wireless
mice
these
days
from
big
brand
names,
but
this
product
goes
to
show
that
spending
more
does
not
necessarily
guarantee
quality
above
other
brands
that
you
may
not
have
already
heard
of.
this
product
is
fine
example
of
example
of
this
-
good
price,
nice
to
use
and
does
good
job!
1for
the
price
you
cannot
go
wrong.
like
the
feature
it
turns
off
to
save
on
battery
is
great
feature.the
ergonomics
are
good
however
just
me
have
smooth
hands
and
this
is
smooth
mouse
so
just
like
bit
rough
surface
but
it
does
not
deter
from
the
quality
of
the
mouse.overall,
am
very
happy
for
the
price
paid.
it
seems
sturdy,
worked
on
my
laptops.
the
accuracy
of
the
mouse
is
good
too!
the
mouse
is
better
than
my
old
lenovo
mouse
which
seem
to
be
bit
less
ergonomic
and
lacked
the
feel.no
complaints
would
recommend
this
wireless
mouse.
have
number
of
wireless
mice
for
work
and
home
laptops.
this
one
is
one
of
the
best
have
though,
its
sleek,
comfortable
and
fits
my
hand
well.
it's
too
early
to
comment
on
battery
life,
but
with
the
addition
of
an
on/off
switch
expect
it
will
outlast
some
of
the
others
which
tend
to
get
knocked
on
in
my
bag.
so
overall
am
very
happy
with
my
purchase.
took
days
to
arrive.......by
amazon
prime!
when
it
finally
came
this
product
is
cheap
and
nasty.
so
i'm
very
surprised
if
all
the
reviews
on
here
are
genuine.
the
spring
in
the
battery
compartment
was
damaged
and
pointing
upwards
so
wouldn't
hold
the
battery
in
place.
unfortunately
it
was
also
completely
inaccessible
so
impossible
to
correct
so
live
end
of
the
battery
was
not
connecting
properly
and
hence
no
power
to
the
mouse.
cheap
crap
beware!!!!
really
odd
product.
use
it
for
all
round
pc
work,
office,
gaming
and
working
on
the
internet.sometimes
it
works
fine,
then
suddenly
its
reactions
go
slow,
the
left
mouse
button
ceases
to
work
and
it
generally
ceases
to
function
well
at
all.not
recommended...even
at
the
cheap
price
my
previous
usb
mouse
gave
up
and
funds
are
very
tight
so
went
for
this
wireless
option.wow!
prompt
delivery
and
so
easy
to
use.
it
was
very
reasonable
price
and
feel
it
is
so
smooth
and
light
and
easy
for
my
arthriris-y
fingers
to
manage!i
would
definitely
recommend!!!
absolutely
brilliant
design.
all
the
functions
work
well
and
the
device
links
automatically
with
the
pc
when
you
insert
the
bluetooth
receiver;
no
setup
software
needed.only
complaint
is
with
amazon
delivery
driver
who
watched
circling
my
address
all
day
on
the
tracking
map
delivering
other
items
until
after
the
delivery
time
amazon
stated,
then
left
sodden
cardboard
package
that
felt
like
he'd
dumped
it
in
puddle.fortunately
the
contents
were
undamaged
and
i'm
delighted
with
the
mouse.
great
priced
mouse,
easy
to
set
up
and
away
you
go.
like
that
it
goes
to
sleep
when
not
being
used.
the
only
thing,
didn't
properly
read
the
instructions,
and
when
saw
no
usb
nano
in
the
box
or
taped
to
the
mouse
got
impatient.
so
please
know
the
nano
usb
is
underneath
the
mouse
at
the
bottom,
and
you
just
pull
it
out
and
put
in
your
pc.
it's
good
mouse.
takes
aa
battery,
is
very
light,
and
works
without
mouse
pad
on
my
desk,
so
is
an
improvement
to
my
old
mouse.
the
button
to
change
the
dpi
is
useful,
and
there
have
been
occasions
in
the
past
when
wanted
to
change
what
will
now
take
me
the
click
of

would
buy
again!
great
mouse
-
exactly
what
wanted.

barely
noticeable
as
per
description.
like
the
sleek
look
and
it
grips
very
comfortably.
the
only
thing
is,
have
recently
noticed
that
it
keeps
freezing
half
way
the
task
so
not
sure
the
battery
is
low
which
it
is
not
very
economical
as
had
it
for
just
over
month,
or
it
is
just
faulty.
but
otherwise,
happy
with
the
purchase.
why
would
anyone
pay
fortune
for

it

six
easy
to

four

which
are
the
left

the

the

never
had
mouse
with
more
than
three
buttons
before
but
really
enjoying
these
extra
features.
and
of
course
the
price
is
amazing
loved
it
when
it
first
arrived,
really
fast
delivery
as
my
old
one
died
on
me,
but
glad
didn't
write
review
straight
away
because
now
the
mouse
is
lazy
and
have
to
bang
it
gently
on
the
desk
to
get
it
to
wake
up,
it
just
forgets
what
it's
job
it,
ordering
different
one
bought
this
as
back
up
mouse
for
my
work
laptop.
considering
used
it
only
handful
of
times
changed
the
battery
twice
and
it
stopped
working
when
needed
it
after
short
period
of
time.
have
thrown
it
in
the
bin.
just
stopped
working.
i've
rebooted,
changed
the
battery,
put
the
bluetooth
dongle
in
different
usb
port,
etc
but
nothing.
was
great
before
that
but
can't
work
out
what
has
gone
wrong.
will
look
for
different
brand
:/
this
arrived
quickly
and
is
so
easy
to
use.
it
is
just
the
right
size
for
me.
you
just
remove
the
small
usb
-
plug
into
your
laptop
,
add
an
aa
battery
to
the
mouse
and
it
works
straight
away.
really
pleased
-
so
easy
to
use.
was
looking
for
something
to
carry
out
with
me
and
wireless
was
the
way
to
go.
this
mouse
is
light,
works
perfectly
and
does
the
job
well.
is
very
comfortable
to
hold
which
is
important
for
daily
use.
would
definitely
recommend
for
comfort
and
ease
of
use.
like
the
shape
and
size
of
this
mouse,
it's
bigger
than
my
old
one,
which
is
another
reason
like
it,
and
it's
very
comfortable
to
work
with.
very
easy
to
set
up,
just
plug
in
and
click
to
go.even
non-techy
like
me
can
set
this
up!!
ordered
this
quite
late
yesterday
evening
and
received
it
this
afternoon.
great
little
mouse.
more
than
happy
with
it.
for
5.88
you
can't
go
wrong.
only
been
using
it
for
couple
of
hours
but
can't
fault
it
so
far.
given
the
price
of
this
mouse,
was
somewhat
sceptical
that
it
was
going
to
be
any
good.
have
bought
others
for
similar
price
and
they
have
been
pretty
rubbish
so
this
was
my
last
attempt
before
spent
big.i'm
certainly
not
disappointed
:the
mouse
sits
really
well
in
my
hand,
not
too
small
and
not
too
big.
it
glides
nice
and
smooth
across
my
desk
and
it's
really
responsive,
both
with
clicks
of
the
buttons
and
moving
the

this
wireless

is
excellent

all
the

like
that

this
mouse
is
horrible,
it
really
is
one
of
the
worst
i've
ever
used,
so
badly
designed
that
accidental
clicks
occur
frequently
but
the
worst
thing
is
the
response
&
feedback
from
the
scroll
wheel
it
is
just
hideous,
its
an
all
round
awful
experience
with
noisiest
mouse.

to
be

this
is
really
annoying
mouse.
the

is
poor
and
often
have
to
switch
it

item
at

wasn't
too
sure
what
to
expect
for
the
price
but
am
really
impressed.
the
mouse
is
much
better
than
my
previous
one
which
only
replaced
because
found
the
flashing
blue
light
of
the
receiver
distracting.
this
one
has
nano

and
no

at

you
don't
even
notice
it.
plugged
it
in
my
windows

laptop,
switched
the
laptop
on
and
the
mouse
worked
straight
away.
so
far
am
very
happy
with
it.
it
also
only
uses
one

bonus
as
my
previous
one
used

this
mouse
has
been
great
for
all
of
my
engineering
assignments.
when
we
do
computer

it
is
very
comfortable
to
use,
even
after
several
hours
of
use.
the
buttons
work
really
well,
and
really
like
the
overall
ergonomics
of
the
product.
it
even
has
its
own
energy
saving
mode.
if
the
mouse
hasn't
been
used
for
few
minutes,
then
it
will
put
itself
to

and
you
just
need
to
click
on
it
to
wake
it
up

better
than
previous
ones
have
bought
which
cost
lot
more
.
this
mouse
is
superb
especially
for
the
price
paid,
like
the
way
the
usb
fits
conveniently
in
to
the
bottom
of
the
mouse
and
it
connects
instantly
upon
inserting
the
usb
stick
in

for
movement
it
works
fine
and
functions
well

this
is
very
good
and

the

the
only
problem
is
how

can
be,
but
same
with
most
types
the
mouse
is
honestly
just
great.
bought
it
to
use
with
my
laptop,
as
i'm
not
fan
of
trackpads.
it's
bit
bigger
than
actually
expected,
but
it
fits
great
in
my
hand
and
it
works
very
well.

only
thing

is
