active

to

my
main
reason
for
buying
this
headset
was
to
make
professional
calls
since
it
had
feature,
mems
noise
cancelling
microphone
however
it
didn't
work
well
for
my
calls,
taken
from
my
home
or
office
have
not
tried
in
busy
crowded
place
like
market/bus
the
ceiling
fan
or
ac
sounds
were
also
not
cancelled
had
to
return
it
as
it
didn't
solve
my
purpose
this
is
my
first
impression
after
an
initial
usage
the
noise
cancelling
feature
for
which
purchased
this
headset
was
functioning
very
well
and
met
my
expectations
compared
to
more
expensive
options,
believe
this
unit
is
reasonableupdate:
really
impressed
with
this
headsetnoise
cancellation
of
continuous
noise
is
superb
music
can
be
enjoyed
with
lower
volume
levelgood
stuff
:
honestly
speaking
the
reason
behind
buying
these
earphones
is
curiosity
and
the
ability
to
own
an
anc
headset
of
this
spec
list
for
this
cheap
price
once
tried
the
bose
qc
20i
at
reliance
digital
store
and
was
surprised
how
anc
actually
has
legit
science
behind
it
also
realized
that
it's
not
cheap
tech
times
more
than
these
earphones
years
later
when
saw
these
taotronics
providing
similar
specs
for
such
low
cost,
it
made
me
think
'might
as
well
own
an
anc
earphone'
did
love
the
idea
of
damping
ambient
noise
during
bus
and
train
commute
partly
to
lower
the
annoyance
and
partly
to
allow
lower
volume
level
leading
to
'safer'
hearing
experiencefinally
received
the
headset,
been
listening
to
it
for
few
days
trying
in
different
ambient
noise
environments
honestly
feel
like
got
more
than
what
expected
really
right
now
am
riding
on
train,
as
am
writing
this
review
shall
try
to
be
as
clear
as
possible
to
'explain'
what
these
headset
actually
does
to
noisemind
you,
one
needs
to
have
some
realistic
expectations
with
products
like
this
what
you
are
buying
is
not
going
to
give
you
the
feel
of
late
night
pin
drop
silence
in
an
environment
with
noise
what
it
'is'
going
to
give
u,
is
satisfactory
nonethelessanc
headsets
in
general
only
cancels
out
lower
frequency
noise
and
noticeably
lowers
mid
frequencies,
keeping
the
extreme
highs
untouched
no
anc
can
cancel
out
human
voice
only
lower
it
bit
sounds
that
we
hear,
for
eg
:
the
roaring
of
engine,
passing
of
vehicle
at
high
speed,
sound
of
train,
etc
contains
combination
of
various
low,
mid
and
high
frequency
elements
as
you
put
on
these
earphones
the
very
first
thing
you
notice
is
obvious
noise
'isolation'
due
to
the
earbuds
you
hear
all
the
usual
sounds,
albeit
bit
muffled
thanks
to
the
earbuds
the
moment
you
turn
on
the
anc
button,
instantly
you
notice
that
the
'low'
frequency
element
as
mentioned
above
is
totally
gone
humming
kinda
constant
sound
the
'mid'
frequency
element
is
slightly
noticeable
while
the
'high'
frequency
elements
stay
on
its
like
you
are
playing
recording
of
the
'noise'
you
are
hearing
on
music
system
with
the
'bass'
and
'mids'
equalizer
nobs
lowered
all
the
way
what's
left
is
mild
shrill
version
of
the
actual
noise
for
example,
right
now
in
this
train
can
only
hear
the
treble
part
of
the
noise
of
the
train,
almost
indistinguishable
all
these
without
playing
any
music
yes,
you
can
actually
use
these
without
even
plugging
it
in
an
audio
sourcealso
you
will
notice
that
the
anc
switch
applies
an
equalizer
of
sorts
kindly
like
headphone
portable
dac
does
which
enhances
the
bass,
mids
and
clarity
just
love
the
changed
soundoverall
with
the
anc
working
and
the
eq
applied
by
the
anc
unit
the
sound
you
end
up
hearing
will
leave
you
fully
satisfied
its
fun
sounding
headsetas
for
comfort
and
build,
refer
to
other
reviews
for
details
in
short,
the
earbuds
aren't
like
conventional
ones,
it's
oval
in
shape
damn
comfortable
also
has
separate
earhooks
that
keep
these
fixed
at
one
place
no
head
jerks
can
make
it
lose
as
for
the
complaints
of
people
saying
the
anc
unit
is
heavy
without
clip
provided,
haven't
yet
noticed
it
probably
because
am
sitting,
if
start
walking
do
kinda
feel
that
it
probably
will
be
gently
yanking
on
my
ears
oh
and
the
anc
unit
is
metal,
it's
obvious
by
how
cold
it
is
to
one's
touchthe
'awareness'
button
is
very
useful
thing
too
it
just
stops
the
anc
function
and
relays
outside
sound
with
couple
of
extra
decibels
into
your
ears
it's
not
simply
allowing
sound
to
enter
by
turning
off
the
anc,
it
'actually'
records
outside
sound
through
the
inbuilt
mics
on
each
ear
and
play
the
same
using
the
sound
drivers,
all
these
without
any
lagam
happy
and
satisfied
customer
taotronics
excellent

performance
is
definitely
close

heard
long

lessthe
picture

shows
the

unit
very
good
build
quality
and
sound
quality
the
active
noise
cancellation
blocks
lot
of
ambient
noise,
and
while
hearing
music,
you
can't
even
hear
someone
talking
in
front
of
you
don't
expect
it
to
stop
some
drilling
sound
though,
even
better

can't
do
that
would
recommend
this
over

nothing

it,
experience
it
this
is
one
of
the
best
anc
earphones
that
is
nearly
unbelievable
for
the
price
had
doubts
about
the
product
at
first
but
beginning
to
love
it
the
seller
in
particular
was
very
good
in
packaging
and
super
speed
shipping
,
so
special
mention
to
him
that
you
orginmarketingin
and
amazon
these
are
my
first
pair
of
noise
cancellation
earphones
and
they
are
great
i'm
no
audiophile
and
can't
comment
on
the
sound
quality,
but
don't
have
any
complaints
either
however
absolutely
love
the
noise
cancellation
mostly
use
it
when
i'm
outdoors,
among
public
and
it
does
fantastic
job
of
blocking
out
external
soundsit's
not
perfect
of
course,
if
someone
is
talking
right
beside
you,
you
can
hear
them
but
their
voice
would
be
muffled
or
someone
honks
around
you,
you
can
hear
it
but
things
like
fan
nearby,
or
machine
or
motor
are
cut
out
to
large
extent
basically
it
reduces
lot
of
the
ambient
noise,
and
even
sudden
noises
are
attenuated
greatly
so
you
can
hear
the
stuff
playing
in
your
earphones
more
clearlyi
liked
this
so
much
that
bought
another
pair
within
few
weeks
after
year
of
use
not
very
frequent
admittedly
they
are
still
working
fine
the
noise
cancellation
on
this
was
better
than
pair
of
sennheiser
anc
around
the
ear
headphones
that
cost
double
this
after
discount
for
this
price
,
does
its
job
completely,
the
material
quality
is
good,
the
sound
quality
is
good,
and
most
importantly
the
noise
canceling
is
good,
the
only
con
here,
or
lacking
here
is
the
earbud
rubber
material
which
is
very
smooth
one
and
slips
out
of
ear,
should
have
been
rough
rubber
one,
and
secondly
there
are
no
other
rubber
locks
/
hooks
given
for
comfort
choices
hence
stars
than
amazing
product
for
the
money
active
noise

lot
this
is
cheaper
product
which
offers
good
noise
cancelling

bit
mildupdate
3:
this
has
really
grown
on
me
and
love
the
noise
cancellation
featureupdate
2:
much
better
after
using
clip
to
reduce
the
weight
of
the
earplugs
still
feel
clip
should
be
included
in
the
box
to
offset
the
battery
weightupdate
1:
after
days
of
using
it,
i've
noticed
that
the
earplugs
are
heavy
and
they
give
me
neck
ache
every
time
wear
them
for
more
than
30
minutes
i'm
not
sure
whether
it's
due
to
the
dangling
noise
cancellation
module
but
even
after
clipping
that
to
my
shirt,
they
feel
heavier
than
normal
earplugs
reduced
rating
does
perfect
job
as
mentioned
it
reduces
more
than
90%
of
the
noise
and
but
not
the
voice
battery
backup
is
awesome
have
used
it
in
very
noisy
areas
like
mumbai
airport
and
local
trains
too
and
these
earphones
did
great
job
reducing
unwanted
noise
also
found
these
better
than
the
$amsung
level
in
ones
earlier
being
used
to
treble
heavy
sony
earphones
this
was
bass
heavy
to
my
ears
but
slowly
started
loving
its
sound
quality
stereo
effects
are
also
goodbeing
first
time
user
of
noise
cancellation,
wasn't
expecting
much
out
of
this
at
its
price
range,
and
loved
what
got
with
this
it's
subtle
but
you
will
feel
the
difference
it
helps
during
my
daily
office
commute
noone
should
expect
complete
silence
out
of
thisthere
is
one
issue
with
noise
cancelling
on,
when
my
office
bus
passes
over
some
big
potholes
of
my
city,
there
is
some
added
noise
in
the
earphonesto
sum
up,
for
me,
this
was
value
for
money
my
product
stopped
working
in
less
than
month
when
tried
to
charge
via
usb
cable,
there
was
slight
spark
and
that
was
the
end
of
it
and
loss
of
5000
rs
when
called
amazing
they
said
return
timeframe
is
over
when
asked
for
service
centre
,
they
said
they
are
not
aware
and
need
to
google
it
sent
direct
message
to
tao
tronics
via
twitter
and
they
said
the
following:
must
say
,

no

compared

not

great
product
using
it
for
my
day
to

life
the
active
noise
cancelling
dulls
out
the
noise
of
fans,
air
conditioner
and
most
other
dull
noises
of
the
surroundings
the
sound
quality
is
great,
good

and
decent

definately
worth
buying
great
value
for

very
expensive
and
noise
cancelling
does
not
cancel
voices
amazon
did
not
return
and
refund
never
going

trust
amazon
with
buying
new
products
as
they
are
extremely
sly
in
refund
policy
they
dont
arrange
return
pick
ups
easily
so
they
don't
loose
money
once
got
fairly
priced
for
the
performance
offered
however,
the
processing
unit
is
pretty
heavy
to
let
off
to
dangle
without
clip
you
feel
the
weight
hanging
off
your
ears
too
bad
to
have
left
that
unattended,
designers
and
don't
even
think
about
using
this
earphones
during
your
regular
gym
workout
or
while
jogging
have
been
using
it
for
the
past
few
weeks
now
these
are
good
bunch
of
earphones
am
used
to
travelling
in
an
ac
bus
to
and
from
office
every
day
the
noise
cancellation
cuts
out
good
amount
of
traffic
noisethough
it
could
have
been
better
with
my
samsung
ordinary
headphones,
used
to
keep
the
volume
above
90%
during
my
travel
with
these,
the
noise
cancellation
helps
me
keep
it
to
around
50%
or
below
the
only
thing
dont
like
about
this
is
the
size
of
the
nc
unit
it
feels
like
it
pulls
my
earphones
down
with
the
weight
but
they
are
stuck
in
them
due
to
the
locks
ofcourse
they
have
never
fallen
off,
but
the
pull
is
there
and
they
do
not
look
that
expensive
have
been
using
bose
quite
comfort
for
bit
now
wanted
to
see
if
ear
plugs
would
be
more
comfortable
for
long
flights
although
the
product
does
what
it
should
do
at
the
price
it
is,
however
if
you
compare
it
with
bose
it
would
terribly
fail
in
sound
as
well
as
anc
really
good
product
for
the
money
you
spenddefinitely
good
and
cheap
alternative
for
bosebut
needs
more
refinementrest
is
great
it's
very
good
for

cancellation
it
works
for
most
of
the
common

also
the

goodbass

best
earphones
excellent
product
this
product
has
no
noise
cancellation
it
is
just
rip
off
amazing
product
for
that
price
awesome
way
exceeded
my
expectations
although
not
quite
in
the
bose
league
,
but
for
1/4th
the
price
these
do
an
amazing
job
the
anc
really
works
on
continuous
humming
sounds
of
airplane
engines
as
well
as
ambient
motor
traffic
and
air
conditioner
noises
good
battery
life
and
pretty
good
sound
signature
too
however
i've
given
it
one
star
less
because
the
wire/cable
material
used
seems
like
an
obsolete
kind
of
rubber
or
so
quite
unlike
the
modern
earphone
cables,
also
the
battery
hangs
pretty
high
up
at
the
neck
or
chest
level
so
an
additional
"clip"
would
do
wonders
along
with
this
product
over
all
good
experience
with
these
super
fast
delivery
by
amazon
recommended
tried
this
on
long
international
air
trip
from
india
to
the
us,
and
again
on
my
return
journey
back
to
india
used
it
to
watch
movies
and
listen
to
music
from
the
inflight
entertainment
system
it
served
the
purpose
very
well
and
am
satisfied
with
my
purchase
the
movie
audio
was
clear
and
the
earphones
were
sufficiently
effective
in
blocking
out
the
engine
roar
the
music
sounded
good
and
deep,
though
certainly
not
audiophile
level
the
battery
lasted
long
enough
without
needing
recharge
in
any
case
usb
ports
were
available
at
every
seat
in
the
airplanei
also
use
this
sometimes
at
home
or
office
to
block
out
noise
while
working
does
the
job
reasonably
well
but
don't
work
in
very
high
noise
environment
so
normal
earphones
suffice
as
welloverall
feel
this
is
good
value
for
money
you'll
probably
get
better
quality
with
the
expensive
products
from
bose,
am
not
sure
but
even
those
don't
give
audiophile
audio
output
as
per
reviews
so
if
you
don't
travel
by
air
very
frequently/don't
have
noisy
environment,
you
probably
shouldn't
waste
too
much
money
on
more
expensive
options
just
amazing
noise
cancellation
for
this
price
have
all
bose
products
and
this
one
is
as
good
as
the
other
ones
the
bose
noise
cancelling
with
wire
don't
have
the
ref
with
me
is
as
good
as
this
one
but
far
more
expensive
and
does
not
fit
in
ears
as
this
onethe
headset
bose
is
better
but
normal
as
it
keep
the
ear
closedthe
noise
cancelling
of
sony
is
just
rubbish
compared
to
thesebuy
this
one,
you'll
not
regret
it
it's
better
than
my
bose
wireless
ii
headphones
and
pairing
it
with
my
honor
view
10
audio
supported
phone,
the
listening
experience
is
truly
amazing
when
anc
is
turned
on
battery
recharges
in
one
hour
and
provides
anc
for
atleast
10
hours
for
one
full
charge
bought
these
for
mowing
the
grass
the
noise
cancellation
works
pretty
good
for
the
price,
but
does
not
completely
block
out
that
level
of
sound
do
not
need
the
volume
up
all
the
way,
so
it
is
better
than
my
other
noncancelling
earbudsthe
switch
works
well
to
turn
on/off
the
nc
and
the
battery
lasts
for
at
least
the
15
hours
they
claim
the
"m"
button
is
basically
mute
it
mutes
the
music
but
amplifies
the
ambient
soundsthere
are
multiple
ear
pieces
so
that
you
can
fit
them
securely
do
not
need
to
keep
reaching
up
to
fit
them
better
more
strenuous
exercising
might
loosen
them
up
little,
but
bike
ride
and
power
walk
is
okthe
sound
quality
is
not
amazing,
but
for
the
price,
they
are
better
than
more
expensive
nonnc
buds
decent
base,
mid
range
is
ok,
treble
gets
little
tinny
at
higher
volume,
but
the
nc
helps
with
thatthe
only
negative
have
is
that
there
was
no
clip
the
battery
pack
is
little
weighty
and
can
pull
on
your
ears
pulled
the
clip
off
an
old
set
of
samsung
earbuds
and
it
fit
perfectlyvery
happy
with
them
for
the
price
will
buy
again
bought
these
years
ago
and
still
use
them,
especially
for
flights
hate
the
overtheears
noise
cancelling
headphones
because
they
start
hurting
my
head
during
long
period
wear
on
international
flights
that
are
10+
hours,
can't
possibly
keep
them
on,
which
is
why
these
earbuds
are
perfect
they
block
out
external
noise
well
and
can
watch
movies
on
the
plane
without
turning
up
the
volume
to
maximum
and
blowing
out
my
ears
also
wear
them
for
sleeping
too
on
long
flights
because
it
cancels
out
the
drink
cart
noise
and
passenger
noise
well
yes,
you
have
to
charge
these
to
get
the
noise
cancellation
to
work
otherwise
they
are
just
another
pair
of
earbuds
the
cord
to
charge
them
is
so
short
that
you
can't
charge
them
and
wear
the
earphones
at
the
same
time
this
is
inconvenient
if
you
are
wearing
them
for
more
than
couple
of
hoursthe
sound
is
good,
the
noise
cancellation
is
good
when
they're
charged,
and
they
are
comfortable
for
few
hoursafter
that
they
started
to
make
my
ears
sore
this
ear
buds
worked
great,
but
had
few
problems
the
ear
bud
comes
with
different
sizes
which
was
nice,
but
they
kept
falling
off
and
getting
lost
went
threw
all
the
sizes
they
sent
and
had
to
buy
ln
ear
bud
replacement
set
at
well
another
problem
had
was
that
the
plug
part
started
to
separate
from
the
housing
to
exposed
wires
taped
it
to
stop
it
from
seperating
today
the
wires
and
the
plug
snapped
cannot
use
the
headphones
anymore
i'm
disappointed
they
last
longer
considering
the
price
these
are
excellent
earphones,
and
the
noise
cancellation
works
well
sit
under
huge,
loud
air
vent
at
work,
and
these
earphones
kept
me
from
losing
my
mind
from
hours
of
sitting
in
that
loud
spot
when
one
of
the
speakers
in
the
ear
bud
became
detached
after
10
months
of
use,
reached
out
to
the
seller,
sunvalley
brands,
to
ask
if
was
covered
under
the
12
month
warranty
the
seller
responded
promptly,
and
offered
to
send
me
replacement
item
for
free,
which
received
shortly
after
i'm
giving
stars
for
the
quality
of
the
product
and
for
the
excellent
customer
service
received
highly
recommended
haven't
used
these
as
much
as
thought
would,
until
started
motorcycle
riding
again
the
profile
is
perfect
for
helmet
wearing
with
good
sound,
and
zapping
out
lot
of
wind
and
engine
noise
while
still
being
able
to
hear
things
like
emergency
vehicles
they
are
fairly
flat
with
very
small
battery
pack
that
is
not
in
your
ears
stars
for
motorcycling
fair
quality
of
noise
cancellation
you
still
hear
lot
of
background
noise
and
it
seems
to
induce
some
new
noise
rather
than
cancel
existing
noise
the
buds
fit
ok,
but
you
do
have
to
work
them
to
get
perfect
tight
fit
for
most
effective
cancellation
the
battery
lasts
for
overseas
long
air
flights
but
they
are
not
that
comfortable
so
your
ears
start
to
hurt
from
the
earbuds
bought
it
for
my
boyfriend
specifically
for
the
noise
cancelling
feature
since
he
works
in
noisy
office
he
said
it
actually
enhances
the
surrounding
noises
and
thought
he
was
being
too
nitpicky,
but
as
bizarre
as
it
is,
you
do
notice
the
surrounding
noises
more
with
the
noise
cancelling
feature
got
these
to
use
at
work
when
i'm
on
my
lunch
break
they
do
not
cancel
out
all
outside
sound
but
they
do
help
the
battery
life
is
also
pretty
good
and
they
recharge
quickly
these
lasted
three
days
shy
of
two
years
daily
use
for
their
cheaper
price,
with
no
other
problems,
would
buy
another
pair
if
they
were
still
available
pretty
decent
headphones
but
they
don't
noise
cancel
worth
anything
maybe
it's
also
because
own
the
bose
ones
so
that's
like
comparing
race
car
to
cactus
anyways,
giving
stars
because
the
sound
quality
and
fit
are
good
but
it
don't
do
nothing
for
noise
cancellation
in
my
opinion
bought
them
for
travel
and
have
taken
them
on
multiple
plane
rides,
and
now
two
years
later
wear
them
to
work
they
are
constantly,
hours
day
every
day,
and
have
zero
issues
sound
quality,
durability,
comfort,
got
everythingi
have
never
used
other
noise
cancellation
devices
before
so
can't
speak
to
that
as
much,
but
in
my
experience
it
took
me
about
15
seconds
to
get
used
to
it,
and
then
was
immersed
in
the
sound
great
for
repetitive
background
noise
only,
wish
the
product
had
and
auto
off
feature
because
the
battery
is
not
that
great,
that
being
said
for
airplanes
its
excellent
for
travel
my
sister
in
law
is
very
sensitive
to
noise
and
uses
them
for
when
she's
riding
the
train
through
loud
tunnels
she
loves
them,
says
they're
lifesaver
broke
after
few
months
right
earpiece
has
no
noise
coming
out
of
it
quite
disappointed
for
the
price
paid
am
very
satisfied
with
this
productbut
only
problem
im
having
right
now
is
lost
ear
buds
and
cant
find
one
that
fits
herewould
it
be
possible
to
buy
only
ear
buds
nice
product
for
the
mony
you
paid
great
product
this
is
terrible
product
doesn
work
and
died
one
day
after
turned
it
on
couldn
even
use
it
on
my
11
flight
garbage
don
buy
it
it
waste
of
money
returning
liked
it
lot
title
says
it
all
these
are
great
headphones
for
the
price
didn't
want
to
spend
10000
+
to
drown
out
the
door
sit
next
to
these
help
one
of
the
ear
pieces
came
off
though
superglued
it
back
and
it's
now
fine
only
bummer
is
thought
there
was
warranty,
which
now
can't
find
info
on
that
said,
still
love
the
headphones,
especially
at
this
price
point
but
the
wires
broke
down
within
months
