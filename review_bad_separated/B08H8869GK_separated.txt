bought
house
sign
in
february
2018
from
ksmart
sign
ltd
via
amazon,
which
initially
was
pleased
with,
it
looked
very
smart
however
the
stand
offs
and
covers
have
now
deteriorated
and
have
become
very
unsightly
contacted
smart
sign
ltd
sending
them
the
attached
photo,
and
to
advised
them
of
my
issue,
and
to
ask
if
they
could
supply
me
with
stainless
steel
stand
offs
and
covers,
or
refunded
me
the
purchase
price
they
informed
me
"the
sign
has
been
outside
in
all
weather
types
for
25
years,
there
was
no
guarantee
on
this
product"
this
product
is
sold
to
be
used
outside
in
all
weathers
would
expect
house
sign
to
last
longer
than
years
month
before
parts
of
it
begin
to
disintegrate
found
the
customer
care
demonstrated
by
smart
sign
ltd
matches
their
sub
standard
house
signs
and
would
deffinatly
not
recomend
this
particular
product,
or
buying
from
this
particular
company
it's
simple
product
not
much
to
go
wrong,
except
mine
arrived
with
four
groups
of
small
bubbles
under
the
plastic,
and
number
of
scratches
not
massive
problem
in
bright
sunshine,
but
not
good
either,
and
emphasised
under
the
night
lighthave
contacted
the
supplier
to
hear
what
they
sayupdate:supplier
sent
new
plaque
it's
better
but
it's
still
plastic
sticker
printed
and
stuck
on
piece
of
acrylic
plus
it's
on
the
small
side
for
people
to
see
it
on
the
wall
love
my
sign
ve
had
my
garage
converted
into
an
art
studio
and
got
this
for
bit
of
fun
really
cheap
and
even
if
it
doesn
weather
well
in
few
years
it
cheap
enough
to
replace
can
comment
on
installation
as
my
builders
put
it
up
for
me
but
it
looked
pretty
straightforward
ordered
first
and
the
back
plate
had
minor
dents
in,
ordered
second
one
and
that
came
with
minor
dents
in
seller
sent
out
replacement
which
also
had
minor
dents
in
and
this
time
dent
on
corner
like
it
had
been
dropped
appreciate
the
effort
to
remedy
my
issues
but
give
up
now
have
sent
one
back
for
refund
and
put
up
the
best
of
the
damaged
bunch
sent
back
up
don
know
if
it
been
damaged
on
route
in
which
case
packaging
needs
to
be
reviewed
not
sure
jiffy
bag
is
sufficient
or
it
damaged
in
production
it
may
not
be
seen
from
outside
but
you
pay
for
something
you
expect
not
to
be
damaged
and
we
know
it
there
we
live
on
the
corner
of
road
on
new
estate
12
ave
the
house
on
the
other
street
opposite
us
is
the
next
number
up
from
us,
13
st,
so
everyone
keeps
thinking
we
are
12
st,
which
is
actually
at
the
other
end
of
the
road
logically
and
knocking
at
our
door
instead
at
all
hours
it
was
infuriating
so
we
got
sign
now
we
don't
have
people
knocking
problem
solved
the
sign
arrived
less
that
24
hours
after
ordering,
there
was
very
small
issue
which
was
resolved
without
fuss
or
drama
the
sign
looks
great,
easy
to
fit,
and
looks
like
it
should
have
cost
more
the
speed
of
delivery
for
product
made
to
order
was
excellent
and
was
not
disappointed
with
the
sign
on
arrivaleasy
to
fit
and
looks
greatonly
had
it
couple
of
days
so
cannot
comment
on
wear
and
tear
but
for
the
price
would
highly
recommend
supplier
and
product
during
these
difficult
times
of
covid19
this
company
said
the
sign
would
understandably
be
late,
however
they
were
prompt
getting
it
to
us
plus
we
are
so
happy
with
the
sign,
it
really
makes
the
front
of
the
house
look
great
would
definitely
recommend
this
company
and
would
buy
again
this
is
stylish
went
step
further
and
added
my
road
to
the
number
which
looks
fab
can't
go
wrong,
easy
to
install
also,
like
the
idea
you
can
design
before
submitting
so
you
can
check
font
etc,
arrived
on
time,
and
looks
wonderful
with
my
new
door
arrived
within
days
of
ordering
and
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
the
quality
after
reading
some
of
the
reviews
easy
enough
to
install
and
looks
alot
better
than
expected
definitely
worth
the
money
in
my
opinion
this
had
delivery
time
of
710
days
which
was
fine
with,
however,
it
arrived
after
only
daysit
was
super
easy
to
install
put
it
up
in
less
than
minutes
looks
great
as
welli
would
highly
recommend
this
product
and
company
from
the
experience
had
with
them
with
this
purchase
not
as
good
quality
as
was
expecting,
it
printed
sticker
attached
to
clear
perspex,
not
printed/etched
directly
to
it
as
expected
can
comment
on
fitting
as
haven
done
this
yet,
not
sure
how
it
going
to
stand
up
to
the
weather
with
the
way
it
been
printed/applied
easy
to
install,
nice
custom
made
sign
been
up
few
months
and
has
survived
some
harsh
weather
so
far
only
took
minute
to
take
off
when
painting
the
wall
and
went
back
on
without
issues
lovely
and
neat
house
sign
very
easy
to
assemble
and
attach
to
wall
using
electric
drill
fittings
supplied
nice
and
clear
print
great
value
and
looks
very
smart
on
the
house
front
the
product
came
with
splashes
of
paint
on
the
perspex
sign
that
cleared
with
credit
card
the
screws
are
too
small
,
tried
to
change
them
but
none
of
the
screws
had
fitted
in
the
spacer
have
managed
to
fix
it
now
but
not
without
few
problems,
delivered
quickly,
easy
to
fit
and
install
looks
good
new
as
have
only
recently
fitted
this
can't
comment
about
how
they
look
after
few
years
usage
in
the
open
air
having
already
had
an
expensive
item
go
awol
on
delivery
and
with
lockdown
the
house
turning
into
logistics
centre
and
uber
eats
regular,
having
this
sign
has
put
an
end
to
any
possible
confusion
husband
put
this
up
in
just
few
minutes,
arrived
we
ll
packaged
acrylic
so
not
sure
how
long
it
will
stand
up
to
the
weather
but
reasonably
priced
and
looks
really
good
having
just
recently
moved,
we
decided
to
get
sign
for
the
house
and
could
not
be
happier

chose
very
stylish
and
of
excellent
quality
and
so
very
easy
to
install
our
order
was
delivered
within
48
hours
and
so
could
not
fault
the
service
would
very
happily
do
business
again
with
this
company
and
could
not
recommend
them
highly
enough
