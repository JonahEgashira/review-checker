i'll
start
with
the
bad
since
theres
less
bad
than
good:0
not
very
effective
for
phone
calls
but
purchased
this
for
music
while
running
so
i'm
only
subtracting
star0
if
you
read
carefully,
there
are
lot
of
reviews
sharing
language
similarities
always
read
reviews
carefully
before
purchasing
product,
so
can
sort
real
reviews
from
fake
ones
went
ahead
and
bought
these
anyway
because
there
were
enough
good
true
reviews
why
not
let
the
product
quality
speak
for
itself0
same
improper
english
tendencies
are
riddled
throughout
the
instruction
manual
it
is
understandable
but
recommend
having
someone
do
grammar
check
and
revise
the
manual,
simply
because
it
comes
off
as
cheap
product
when
the
language
is
unprofessionalon
to
the
good:0
no
issues
connecting0
the
fit
is
good
even
while
running0
very
easy
to
use,
you
dont
have
to
worry
about
turning
these
off
to
save
battery0
love
the
magnetic
charging
case,
and
there
are
neat
indicator
lights
which
show
the
status
of
your
charge,
and
will
automatically
turn
off
once
the
earbuds
are
fully
charged
did
my
research,
looked
at
practically
everything
comparable
been
through
enough
headphones
/earbuds
to
know
any
claimed
differences
are
insignificant
for
the
most
partunderstand
that
the
biggest
reason
these
lesser
known
brand
names
don't
have
many
reviews
which
is
one
of
the
biggest
influences
on
here
is
because
most
shoppers
are
too
hesitant
to
make
purchase
with
them
and
instead
feel
safer
with
big
name
brandsso
with
these
earbuds,
must
say,
have
been
one
of
the
best
purchases
have
ever
made
on
amazon
fit
effortlessly
and
comfortably
in
both
my
ears,
the
design
and
feel
of
these
are
not
cheap
at
all
my
biggest
concern
was
battery
life
because
wear
headphones
my
whole
hour
shift
and
that
was
by
far
the
most
crucial
factor
for
me
and
using
them
couple
weeks
here
are
the
very
encouraging
and
satisfying
details:0
each
bud
last
about
hours
give
or
take
few
minutes0
can
use
together
or
individually
which
was
exactly
what
wanted
to
make
sure
was
the
case
instantly
connects
to
phone
via
bluetooth
after
you
pair
each
earbud
left
&
right
respectively0
the
power
bank
case
has
been
the
biggest
surprise
since
any
bank
have
ever
owned
has
never
lived
up
to
its
manufacturers
claims
have
only
charged
the
case
once
since
got
it
as
it
still
has
over
half
its
juice
left
after
many
times
of
switching
and
charging
each
earbud
about
times
per
shift
which
is
better
than
expected0
each
earbud
takes
just
over
an
hour
to
charge
which
when
only
using
one
at
time
has
made
my
overall
concerns
with
charging
thing
of
the
pastoverall,
don't
get
put
off
by
being
unaware
of
the
manufacture,
and
just
trust
in
these
reviews
me
personally,
can't
think
of
the
last
time
even
took
the
time
to
write
review,
but
have
been
so
blown
away
with
this
purchase
that
felt
it
was
owed
to
the
company
pasonomiamazing
earbuds
came
from
the
gonovate
g0
which
loved
bought
these
as
replacement
and
they
are
great
battery
life
is
good
they
fit
nicely
and
are
not
too
big
and
don't
feel
goofy
wearing
themi
highly
recommend
you
try
all
the
rubber
tips,
you'll
be
surprised
the
smallest
tips
work
the
best
there
are
similar
brands,
bought
the
pasonomi
because
they
were
on
0day
prime,
cheaper,
and
had
0%
off
coupon
there
support
is
good
too
from
what
seeyou
can
use
them
separately,
the
instructions
show
you
how
to
only
use
them
for
music,
have
used
them
for
phone
calls
you
can
turn
them
on
without
the
case
just
don't
like
that
you
can't
turn
them
off
without
the
case
unless
you
turn
off
your
phone
bluetooth
for
minutesi
still
never
thought
would
rate
this
stars,
but
after
week
of
using
themthey
are
solid
have
shopped
for
months
before
decided
on
these
they
get
uncomfortable
about
about
hours
use
them
when
go
grocery
shopping
or
sitting
in
the
breakroom
having
developed
quite
the
affinity
for
wireless
earbuds,
decided
to
go
back
to
the
well
and
find
suitable
pair
for
my
wife
this
time,
wanted
pair
of
wireless
earbuds
with
charging
case,
as
she
has
an
older
iphone
model
for
which
the
battery
only
lasts
about
0⁄0
the
day
here
are
our
thoughts:•
package:
the
wireless
earbuds
come
in
nice
portable
case,
which
acts
as
both
carrying
case,
charging
station
for
the
earbuds,
and
its
own
charging
device
for
other
small
electronics
additionally,
there
is
small
usb
cord
that
can
be
used
to
charge
the
charging
case,
as
well
as
three
different
sizes
of
rubber
ear
pieces
one
thing
would
note
is
that
the
carrying
case
is
bit
bigger
than
other
models
that
i've
tested,
though
suspect
that
this
is
due
to
the
charging
capabilities
that
it
carries•
size/fit:
at
first
glance,
the
earbuds
may
look
bit
loose
fitting
due
to
the
lack
of
support
on
the
earpiece
itself
for
that
reason,
decided
to
use
larger
rubber
piece,
though
we
quickly
found
that
the
small
size
is
more
suitable
for
her
fortunately,
we
had
no
real
issues
with
the
fit
as
the
earbuds
fit
very
snugly
and
did
not
feel
loose
at
all
while
in
use
she
even
tested
these
during
light
run
on
the
treadmill,
and
to
our
pleasant
surprise,
the
earbud
did
not
feel
loose
at
all•
connectivity:
we
had
no
issues
connecting
the
earbuds
to
her
iphone
or
ipad
we
were
also
able
to
connect
these
to
my
desktop
at
home
similar
to
airpods,
the
earbuds
connect
automatically
when
you
remove
the
earbud
from
the
charging
case
this
is
small
nit,
but
when
the
left
or
right
earbud
connects
individually,
it
carries
the
same
name
as
the
other
earbud,
so
it
requires
an
additional
step
of
renaming
the
connection
to
differentiate
between
r/l•
sound
and
call
quality:
in
short,
we
were
blown
away
by
the
sound
quality,
as
it
is
rare
for
the
earbuds
to
have
such
solid
bass
this
holds
true
for
variety
of
music,
from
top
to
edm
likewise,
the
call
quality
was
crisp
and
ahead
of
other
similar
wireless
earbuds
that
we've
tested•
charging
case:
we
tested
the
mah
battery
on
her
iphone
the
charge
was
bit
slow
and
suspect
that
it
is
really
only
good
for
single
charge
that
being
said
though,
consider
this
to
be
bit
of
bonus
and
likely
enough
to
get
through
the
whole
day
if
you
do
not
have
access
to
another
chargerin
summary,
this
is
great
value
for
wireless
bluetooth
earbuds
that
also
doubles
as
its
own
portable
charging
device
the
sound
and
call
quality
were
stunning
at
this
price
point,
and
this
has
already
become
the
goto
listening
device
for
my
wife
highly
recommended
for
those
looking
for
new
earbuds
let
me
preface
this
review:
typically
keep
pair
of
pixel
buds,
jaybird
x0s
and
wired
pair
of
bose
earbuds
in
my
arsenal
i'm
mailman
and
want
easy
access
to
reliable
audio
options
haven't
out
these
through
the
wringer
yet
but
plan
on
using
them
for
full
day
monday
to
test
out
battery
life
and
range
when
run
out
of
the
truck
to
make
delivery
my
phone:
google
pixel
xl+pairing
was
simple
enough+these
are
comfortable
at
first
we
shall
see
how
comfortable
after
straight
use
for
0+
hours+sound
quality
is
surprisingly
good
for
this
price
point
and
type
of
earbuds+they
don't
protrude
from
your
ears
too
much
so
you
don't
look
like
an
alien
off
of
dr
whocase
isn't
sleak
and
it's
tad
big
but
it's
not
deal
breakerwhen
entering
my
subaru
with
these
paired
the
subaru
overrides
and
then
makes
you
repair
my
subaru
does
this
to
all
bluetooth
sets
and
it's
always
painbut
i've
learned
its
more
often
than
not
the
subaru
that
needs
repairing
and
not
the
earbudsi'll
test
these
buggers
out
more
and
updatei
didn't
rate:
durability
or
batteryupdate
0/0/0:the
battery
on
these
do
charge
quickly
but
they
only
last
hours
at
timeno
one
can
understand
me
when
i'm
on
phone
call
with
these,
so
thats
another
bummer
for
these
use
these
lot,
and
it's
been
about
months
since
bought
them,
but
they
are
almost
unusable
at
this
point
the
left
pair
doesn't
make
any
sound,
even
when
paired,
and
the
volume
on
the
right
one
is
so
low
my
original
review
is
below:i
was
hesitant
to
buy
these
because
the
price
point
is
low
for
this
type
of
product
took
chance
because
know
amazon's
return
policy
would
protect
me
if
they
were
crap
am
glad
did
have
purposely
waited
month
to
write
review
because
wanted
to
make
sure
they
would
last
great
quality,
easy
pairing,
and
they
work
independently
and
together
quite
well
battery
lasts
0+
hours
use
them
the
most
at
work
where
only
want
one
in
at
time,
and
can
easily
swap
one
for
the
other
when
the
battery
is
drained
the
charging
case
is
great
and
has
remarkable
battery
life
had
trouble
pairing
them
at
first,
probably
because
didn't
follow
the
directions,
and
the
seller
responded
to
my
request
for
help
very
quickly
and
fixed
me
up
right
awayif
you
want
truly
wireless
ear
buds,
buy
these
the
earbuds
and
charge
box
work
great
the
directions
are
poorly
translated
in
english
it
is
hard
to
even
understand
just
what
terrific
product
really
is
the
box
itself
is
remote
battery
charger
that
actually
keeps
the
ear
plugs
charged
when
they
are
in
it
you
have
to
then
recharge
the
battery
via
the
usb
every
now
and
then
also
be
sure
and
remove
the
tiny
pieces
of
green
tape
on
each
earbud
or
they
will
not
charge
the
earbud
battery
in
the
earbud
itself
no
where
in
the
directions
does
ir
say
to
do
this
as
the
tape
looks
very
much
like
it
is
there
to
protect
the
magnet
connection
on
the
buds
otherwise
this
is
very
nice
product
for
the
money

video
was
so
impressed
because
actually
wore
them
the
whole
time
was
in
the
shower
just
to
officially
know
if
they
are
waterproof
or
not
not
only
did
wear
them
listening
to
music
they
were
great
talking
on
the
phone
as
well
was
amazed
as
had
full
conversation
as
well
as
utilized
one
of
the
earbuds
phone
featurs
by
triple
tapping
sensor
the
earbuds
tell
the
phone
to
automatically
redial
the
last
number
you
were
connected
to
overall
so
happy
with
my
pasonomi
bluetooth
wireless
earbudsthanks
these
earbuds
are
so
great,
and
setup
was
breeze
while
the
instructions
weren
perfect
english,
they
were
clear
enough
and
the
device
basically
handled
all
of
the
setup
for
me
ve
been
very
impressed
with
how
well
the
sound
comes
out,
how
these
are
completely
sound
proof,
and
the
long
lasting
battery
power
the
pack
is
great
case
to
keep
the
earbuds
safe
while
traveling,
and
love
the
magnetic
nature
so
the
earbuds
fit
perfectly
in
the
case
for
charging
fabulous
product
i'm
always
bit
skeptical
about
offbrand
items
but
these
earbuds
really
surprised
me
it
was
super
easy
to
set
up
with
my
iphone,
and
charges
very
quickly
the
clarity
on
these
earbuds
is
really
good,
not
like
some
of
the
cheaper
ones
the
case
that
it
comes
in
and
the
storage
back
looks
very
sleek
plenty
of
extra
earbud
tips
in
case
the
old
ones
become
damaged
or
are
lost
really
impressed
would
buy
these
again
comparing
it
with
air
pods,
it
more
comfortable
and
cost
less
very
easy
to
pair
it
with
my
iphone
it
starts
to
pairing
when
take
headphone
out
from
dock
and
connect
to
my
phone
without
problem
take
them
to
the
gym
and
listen
to
my
music
while
am
running
the
charging
dock
can
charge
the
headphone
while
using
it
and
also
charge
my
iphone
for
emergency
it
come
with
charging
cable
put
the
bluethooth
on
at
work
and
keep
the
dock
charging
on
my
desk
worth
buy
wanted
relatively
sweat
proof
bluetooth
set
that
could
wear
outside
working
in
the
yard
or
at
the
gym,
so
decided
to
give
these
try
figured
ponying
up
~$0
instead
of
the
&0
range
would
get
better
setwellthey
worked
fine
for
about
weeks,
then
the
left
bud
just
stopped
working
since
this
is
the
bud
that
pairs
to
the
phone,
they're
worthless
now
and
i've
only
used
them
at
work
in
facility,
with
no
sweating,
so
this
can't
be
attributed
to
moisture
also,
the
microphone
quality
is
not
good
when
on
phone
calls;
most
people
on
the
other
end
said
sounded
like
was
across
the
room
on
speaker
phone
finally,
if
you
only
have
in
your
ear
eg,
while
driving
or
some
other
activity
where
you
need
to
hear
what's
around
you,
it
has
to
be
the
left
bud,
as
the
right
doesn't
have
microphonei'm
returning
them
today
and
trying
something
else
that
isn't
cheap
chinese
tech
do
you
like
device
that
pauses/plays
every
time
you
adjusts
it,
while
somehow
not
sensing
your
touch
when
you
mean
to
or
one
that
doesn't
turn
off
till
the
battery
dies
no
matter
how
long
you
press
the
'button'
for,
or
even
put
it
in
the
chargertrash
where
to
startthese
headphones
are
very
poor
quality
generally
use
headphones
just
to
listen
to
music
for
the
gym
currently
have
some
over
the
head
cowin
bluetooth
headphones,
and
those
have
fantastic
sound,
and
these
were
around
this
same
price
point,
so
was
very
hopeful
that
these
would
be
goodsound:
the
sound
on
these
is
terrible
had
to
turn
my
volume
up
almost
all
the
way
on
my
spotify
to
listen
to
music,
but
it
really
didn't
help
because
there
was
no
bass
or
any
kind
of
depth
to
the
sound
on
these
headphones
whenever
was
listening
to
dance,
pop
or
rap
music
it
sounded
extremely
flat
turning
up
the
volume
did
not
help
this,
just
made
it
sound
more
tinnyfit:
tried
these
at
the
gym
and
they
were
constantly
falling
out
of
my
ears
every
time
did
anything
the
only
time
they
stayed
in
my
ear
was
lowimpact
cardio
if
was
doing
plank
or
went
on
my
back
or
side,
or
getting
up
from
laying
position,
they
would
fall
outdesign:
these
earphones
are
too
sensitive
to
the
touch
for
pause/play
button
so
every
time
the
headphones
fell
out
of
my
ears
during
working
out,
and
i'd
go
to
put
it
back
in,
i'd
hit
the
pause/play
button
it
was
near
impossible
to
put
them
back
in
my
ears
without
touching
the
pause/play
button
and
pausing
my
music
by
mistake
and
then
sometimes
it
would
think
was
trying
to
activate
siri
and
i'd
then
have
to
go
to
my
phone
to
stop
that
and
play
my
music
again
it
was
so
annoying
because
couldn't
concentrate
on
workout
with
my
headphones
falling
out
and
pausing
all
the
timenot
worth
it,
awful
quality,
not
user
friendly,
these
should
be
sold
for
$0
i'm
in
process
of
returning
these
and
think
i'll
just
invest
the
money
in
apple
airpods
or
bose
bluetooth
would
not
recommend
these
if
you
care
about
music
quality
at
all
the
sound
quality
is
complete
garbage
had
bose
sound
sport
and
beats
earbuds
before
bought
these
if
you
want
to
hear
bass
or
miss
in
your
music
then
do
not
purchase
these
the
sound
has
an
echo
effect
that
happens
right
after
pairing
and
again
when
the
battery
is
low
to
top
it
all
off
these
headphones
start
to
get
uncomfortable
fairly
fast
after
you
put
them
on
was
really
hoping
that
the
reviews
on
this
product
were
correct
because
really
wanted
to
save
few
bucks
just
purchased
another
pair
of
bose
sound
sport
wireless
and
now
have
quality
again
it
was
fine
product
that
pretty
much
resembles
all
the
functions
from
my
previously
owned
apple
airpods

pros
and
cons
are
listed
below
for
your
reference:pros:quite
fit
into
my
ears
without
strugglesthe
range
of
the
wireless
connection
is
far
enough
the
music
in
the
earpods
is
still
playing
while
i'm
cooking
downstairs
with
the
mobile
device
connected
left
upstarisi
love
the
onetouch
feature
that
just
need
to
touch
the
surface
of
the
earpods
with
my
finger
tip
to
pause/resume
the
music,
and
double
click
for
dialing
the
most
recent
number
in
recordthe
battery
power
seems
to
be
durablecons:i
still
haven't
figured
out
how
to
skip
songs
with
the
fingertip
touch,
that's
how
accidently
discovered
the
double
click
leads
to
redailing
featurethe
connection
doesn't
appear
to
be
very
impressive
when
you're
calling
through
the
earpods,
people
are
complaining
that
they
are
struggled
to
hear
my
voice
when
am
using
the
earpods
to
speakto
sum
it
up,
the
product
provides
fair
functionality
and
feature
as
nonmainstream
wireless
earphone
brand
and
is
fair
for
its
price
absolutely
the
worst
bluetooth
earbuds
i've
ever
had
don't
waste
your
time
at
first
was
very
pleased
with
this
product
and
enjoyed
handsfree
calls
and
cordless
listening
with
good
quality
sound
however,
the
product
has
suddenly
stopped
working
purchased
the
product
in
late
november
so
i'm
very
disappointed
that
they
only
worked
for
months
the
ear
buds
are
fully
charged
but
can
only
get
the
right
one
to
power
on
and
even
then
it
won't
pair
with
my
devices
so
can't
even
listen
with
one
ear
this
product
has
unfortunately
has
turned
out
to
be
waste
of
money
and
will
not
be
purchasing
products
from
this
company
again
charged
these
before
using
today
and
less
than
hours
in
they
cut
off
no
warning
they
just
seem
to
be
dead
so
now
stuck
on
stationary
bike,
no
music
weak
also,
they
arent
that
loud,
just
acceptable,
with
barely
acceptable
quality
also,
if
you
shift
your
head
little
they
might
cut
out
for
second
also,
if
you
touch
them
to
adjust
them
they
might
tfurn
off
the
music,
so
you
know
try
not
to
have
to
adjust
them
while
you
workout
or
do
anything
that
requires
movement
bought
these
with
the
impression
that
could
use
each
one
individually
and
get
about
hrs
of
play
time
out
of
them,
this
is
not
the
case
you
can
only
use
them
if
the
left
one
is
out
and
as
soon
as
that
dies
they
both
disconnect
also
the
sound
quality
is
terrible
for
the
price
this
was
advertised
to
be
able
to
both
be
used
individually
and
that
is
why
give
it
star
because
hate
false
advertisement
also
the
right
one
skips
sometimes
and
cuts
out
and
if
turn
my
head
to
the
right
outside
it
turns
off
completely
this
product
is
not
good
except
for
the
sound
quality
putting
it
in
your
ear
for
long
time
will
be
very
painful
the
most
terrible
thing
is
that
it
is
easy
to
fall
just
lost
it
when
bought
it
for
three
days
now
can
only
use
one,
and
the
song
is
always
dropped
am
telling
the
truth,
hope
to
help
you
downsides:
the
touch
sensors
on
the
earbuds,
doesnt
matter
who
you
are
they
are
pain
to
adjust
during
workout
touch
pauses
and
depending
which
is
double
touched
its
gonna
skip
song,
held
too
long
and
the
volume
changes,
this
is
neat
to
better
prevent
water
damage
but
it's
tedioussecondly
is
the
volume,
was
disappointed
thats
its
mostly
just
treble
which
is
compared
to
$0
wired
buds,
little
bass
the
ear
bud
sizes
can
be
swapped,
which
are
suuuper
thing
plastic
and
nothing
like
regular
squishy
buds,
but
that
just
helps
cancel
noise
thr
biggerthe
ear
bud,
the
quality
of
sound
is
poorcool
part
was
the
charger
case,
seems
durable
and
charges
phones
and
other
stuff
have
been
using
these
for
about
week
or
two
now
and
have
to
say
am
underwhelmed
the
positives
are
ease
in
pairing,
connecting
to
the
phone
for
use,
in
ear
fit,
and
general
idea
of
being
able
to
charge
when
not
using
themnegatives:
sound
quality:
the
sound
is
very
hollow
and
little
to
no
bass
its
fine
if
listening
to
podcasts,
but
leaves
lot
to
be
desired
when
listening
to
music
connectivity:
while
its
easy
to
connect
to
your
phone,
the
buds
themselves
have
numerous
issues
the
main
issue
is
them
keeping
connectivity
to
themselves
they
frequently
cut
out
sound
in
one
ear
or
the
other
they
also,
on
occasion,
cut
out
sounds
all
together
as
if
was
too
far
away
from
the
bluetooth
source
which
often
keep
in
my
left
breast
pocket
of
my
suit
the
root
cause
of
these
issues
is
unknown
call
quality:
unusable
outside
while
walking
or
with
any
ambient
sound
around
have
had
to
scramble
to
disconnect
them
while
walking
so
can
hold
the
phone
to
my
ear
nothing
but
complaints
from
people,
and
combined
with
the
connectivity
issues,
is
just
nothing
but
frustration
fit
in
case:
if
you
change
your
earbud
size,
it
may
not
fit
well
in
the
case,
and
then
it
may
not
chargei
think
for
the
price
point,
its
still
hard
to
justify
have
pair
of
anklers
that
cost
bucks,
and
none
of
these
issues
just
wanted
something
without
wire
getting
caught
up
on
my
collar
and
would
take
usbc
these
don't
take
usbc
but
figuring
it
takes
many
charges
before
recharging
figured
could
sacrifice
that
in
any
case,
may
very
well
be
going
back
to
the
anklers
have
had
these
for
almost
month
now
and
have
never
had
to
recharge
the
case
pretty
awesome
my
old
headphones
would
only
make
it
through
about
or
workouts
these
headphones
have
lasted
so
far
and
it
doesn't
seem
like
will
need
to
charge
them
anytime
soon
this
is
also
my
first
pair
that
fits
just
in
my
ear
and
have
been
surprised
that
they
have
never
fallen
out
with
the
running,
rowing,
and
insanity
workouts
do
pretty
darn
good
for
the
price
if
you
ask
me
i'm
not
sure
how
this
product
has
so
many
star
reviews
out
of
0,0
reviews
that's
what
brought
me
to
this
product
in
the
first
place
to
buy
them
it
was
cheaper
alternative
to
me
buying
the
samsung
galaxy
buds
for
$0now
that
being
said
bought
these
for
$0
thinking
was
getting
good
product
for
cheap
price
going
off
the
excellent
reviews
no
these
headphones
are
terrible
work
in
manufacturing
plant
where
most
people
by
these
type
of
bluetooths
and
use
them
to
get
through
are
long
shifts
the
battery
life
is
terrible
it
last
up
to
one
hour
of
use
the
sound
quality
is
so
bad
i'm
not
able
to
hear
anybody
while
i'm
talking
on
the
phone
at
work
nor
can
they
hear
me
you
cant
have
either
earbud
in
to
talk
on
the
phone,
you
have
to
have
the
left
earbud
in
to
use
the
phone
feature
and
if
you
put
the
right
earbud
in
its
case
it
disconnects
the
whole
bluetooth
and
you
have
to
reconnect
them
i'm
comparing
these
to
the
samsung
galaxy
buds
which
use
every
day
they
are
amazing
the
have
noise
cancellation
that
actually
works,
my
wife
doesnt
hear
machines
in
my
background
when
she
calls
me
at
work
she
just
hears
my
voice
can
have
either
the
left
or
my
right
in
to
talk
on
the
phone
listen
just
spend
the
money
to
get
the
better
ones
these
are
really
bad
trust
me
was
excited
to
get
these
and
initially
thought
that
they
sounded
ok
researched
how
to
properly
wear
earbuds
and
discovered
that
the
tips
are
meant
to
seal
your
ear,
so
that
it
feels
plugged,
and
once
used
the
correct
size
of
tip
the
sound
quality
improved
lot
really
enjoy
listening
to
music
on
these
now
they
are
engineered
to
play
inside
sealed
ear,
so
if
there
is
any
air
leakage
or
gaps
from
tips
not
fitting
right,
then
the
sound
quality
will
be
affected
when
pause
music
can
still
hear
things
going
on
around
me,
though
bit
muffled
was
using
them
at
the
store,
paused
my
music
and
was
able
to
talk
to
the
cashier
and
finish
my
purchase
just
fine,
then
resume
music
as
was
leavingthey
last
for
about
hours
of
continuous
music
listening
and
then
take
only
hour
in
the
case
to
be
recharged
while
the
case
itself
can
recharge
them
many
times
over
they
say
hrs,
but
haven't
fully
tested
that
yetas
for
the
fit,
they
feel
snug
in
my
ear
and
have
done
some
moving
around
without
feeling
like
they
will
just
fall
outi
have
used
them
in
the
shower
couple
of
times
and
can
say
that
they
do
survive
that
the
only
issue
that
had
in
there
was
that
when
put
my
head
under
the
water
to
rinse/wash
my
hair
the
water
running
over
them
would
cause
them
to
think
that
was
pressing
and
holding
them
and
cause
the
volume
to
increase
to
max
or
decrease
to
min
the
way
found
to
get
around
this
was
to
set
the
bluetooth
volume
lower
on
my
phone
and
max
volume
in
the
headset
to
reasonable
level,
then
wouldn't
get
my
eardrums
blasted
when
the
water
triggered
it
again
that
is
just
due
to
the
touch
controls
on
the
buds
wonder
how
they
will
react
when
swimming,
do
plan
to
find
outlastly
also
connected
them
to
my
computer
to
test
out
listening
to
music
and
using
them
for
voip
calls
and
discovered
couple
of
things
first
bluetooth
interferes
with
0ghz
wireless
signals,
so
if
your
computer/laptop
is
running
on
wireless
in
that
frequency,
then
your
internet
connection
will
cut
in
and
out
fixed
this
by
connecting
my
laptop
to
0ghz
wireless
signal
and
now
it
works
without
any
issues
the
second
issue
was
being
able
to
move
between
listening
to
good
quality
music
and
using
them
as
headset
for
voip
the
default
will
not
allow
you
to
do
that
something
about
bluetooth
bandwidth
just
doesn't
allow
it
so
after
few
hours
and
almost
wanting
to
throw
my
laptop
out
the
window
discovered
that
if
you
just
click
on
the
speaker
icon
in
the
bottom
right
of
your
windows
taskbar
you
will
get
volume
indicator
as
well
as
dropdown
to
select
current
output
when
you
want
to
listen
to
music
or
movies
just
change
that
to
stereo
headphones
it
will
show
the
name
of
the
device
as
well
and
when
you
want
to
make
call
or
record
video
change
that
to
hands
free
headset
also
shows
name
of
device
also,
you
don
not
have
the
functionality
of
switching
to
next
song
or
adjusting
volume
when
you
connect
them
to
the
computerthere
are
no
such
issues
when
connecting
to
your
phone,
all
functionality
is
as
it
should
benow
can
just
switch
them
back
and
forth
between
my
phone
and
computer0
stars
for
the
showering
issue
with
the
touch
commands
would
give
if
could
give
half
am
really
enjoying
these
hopefully
my
comments
will
be
helpful
for
other
buyers
and
users
i've
been
looking
for
bluetooth
earbuds,
and
when
saw
this
product
on
amazon
in
the
first
sight,
decided
to
purchase
it
due
to
its
cute
appearance
the
product
was
delivered
with
perfect
packing
in
timely
manner
together
with
clear
and
detailed
manuali
really
love
the
design
of
the
box,
which
is
super
cute
also,
it's
super
good
for
me
to
have
place
to
store
the
bluetooth
earbuds
when
take
them
off
since
i'm
person
who
always
lost
stuffit
could
be
charged
in
the
box
via
usb
cord
which
makes
it
extremely
convenientit's
easy
to
be
connected
and
works
well
until
nowlove
it
first
of
all
it
came
days
prior
to
the
date
was
given
which
was
amazing
just
thought
it
would
be
regular
earbuds
in
box
but
nooooo
am
not
the
most
tech
savy
person
know,
so
may
just
be
the
only
person
that
didn't
know
what
to
expect
it
came
with
the
ear
buds
as
thought,
thought
that
when
the
battery
would
die
would
need
to
have
charger
etc
to
charge
them
not
the
case
the
charger
actually
charges
the
ear
buds
and
the
case
they
go
in
so
if
they
happen
to
die
and
you
have
the
case
in
the
handy
bag
it
comes
with,
the
charger
base
actually
holds
charge
without
being
plugged
in
the
bag
is
perfect
for
throwing
it
in
your
hand
bag
or
back
pack
and
comes
with
tons
of
extra
ear
pieces
this
is
amazing
for
on
the
go
used
to
take
train
to
work
in
city,
and
this
would
be
amazing
for
situation
where
you
may
not
have
access
to
charging
device
would
recommend
this
to
any
of
my
friends
and
family
this
product
is
not
for
everyone
and
is
not
excellent
but
it
is
passable
for
the
price
bought
these
with
the
intention
of
listening
to
music/videos
in
the
shower
and
to
be
able
to
talk
to
friends
when
go
on
walks
neither
of
these
are
enjoyable
with
these
headphonespros:volume

get

was

company
who
offered
to
replace
the
headset
with

for
free
and
offered
to
refund
0%

this
is

the
new

did
get
the

to
connect

for

it
is

not

and
have
not
been
successful
getting
the
earbuds
to
sync
to
eachother
they
bluetooth
won
sync
to
booth
buds
and
that
really
sucks
when
researched
questions
apparently
others
have
asked
and
been
directed
to
go
to
the
facebook
page
why
because
there
is
nothing
there
think
these
work
for
other
phones
but
iphone
buyers
beware
useful
if
you
want
to
use
one
earbud
at
time
they
look
good
and
have
great
packaging
but
the
bud
stops
there
uuuggg
will
purchase
something
from
best
buy
and
return
these
wanted
to
like
these
the
audio
is
stunningly
crystal
clear
in
both
ears
high
frequency
sounds
are
fabulous,
but
the
bass
is
seriously
lacking
hence,
will
be
returning
them
have
tried
fair
number
of
wireless
headphones
over
the
years,
for
use
them
daily
tend
to
use
my
earbuds
for
lifting
weights,
running,
playing
basketball,
mowing
lawns,
doing
choirs,
and
walking
to
school
the
sound
is
clear
and
they
stayed
in
my
ears
well,
but
that's
about
it
they
lost
connection
enough
when
was
playing
basketball
that
decided
to
turn
them
off,
and
when
tried
them
in
the
gym,
had
to
be
within
feet
for
it
to
work
properly
was
looking
forward
to
bluetooth
0,
for
currently
have
another
pair
with
bluetooth
and
it
connects
to
my
phone
samsung
galaxy
s0
well,
but
these
simply
aren't
the
case
two
stars,
because
it's
clear
sound
and
good
fit
i've
recently
decided
to
check
out
these
"budget"
wireless
earbuds
and
was
shocked*the
pairing
process
was
pretty
self
explanatory
just
hold
both
earbuds
until
they
both
pair
to
eachother*the
only
problem
would
see
in
the
case
is
the
power
bank
feature
could
only
charge
my
phone
0%
more
batteryiphone
plus*the
earbuds
do
slip
out
sometimes
but
it's
not
really
problem*the
range
on
the
earbuds
are
decent
and
it
could
go
from
downstairs
to
upstairs*the
touchscreen
feature
on
the
earbuds
were
nice
touch
to
make
it
have
that
modern
feelingthe
only
complaint
would
have
with
the
product
is
the
battery
life
on
the
case
,
charging
iphone
on
simple
powerbank
can
bring
it
up
to
0%
but
for
this
earbud
powerbank
it
would
only
bring
it
up
few
%
ve
never
had
wireless
headphones
that
were
completely
wireless
so
can
comepare
them
to
others
switching
from
the
beats
power
wireless
after
having
two
pairs
of
those
and
both
of
the
ear
clips/bluetooth
wire
snapping
offupdate:
it
been
almost
hrs
since
received
them
couldn
wait
until
got
off
work
to
try
them
in
the
gym
changed
the
tips
to
help
cancel
out
the
noise
and
it
worked
they
re
not
as
loud
as
my
beats
but
they
re
actually
noise
canceling
so
you
don
need
them
to
be
super
loud
so
even
after
hours
of
listening
my
ears
still
aren
ringing
with
this
being
same
day
review
couldn
tell
you
how
good
the
battery
is
,
but
train
for
little
over
hours
in
the
gym
and
they
still
didn
die
or
say
low
battery
hoping
the
battery
is
good
also
hope
these
last
longer
than
my
beats
my
beats
power
wireless
lasted
almost
year
before
on
snapped
and
know
within
the
first
week
off
getting
them
and
using
them
had
to
super
glue
the
speaker
back
together
because
it
came
apartanyways
the
only
con
with
these
are
they
re
not
as
good
distance
wise
as
the
beats
are
in
an
almost
completely
open
gym
and
the
water
fountain
is
on
the
back
wall
in
the
middle
between
both
locker
rooms
as
got
to
the
fountain
the
sound
started
cutting
out,
but
it
no
issue
ll
keep
my
phone
on
me
especially
so
don
forget
it
or
lose
it
at
the
gymupdate:
it
been
month
and
now
they
won

each
other
can
only
use
one
or
the
other
**update**
0/0/0back
in
december,
purchased
pair
of
these
earbuds
please
see
original
review
below,
and
was
disappointed
because
they
didn't
work
the
company
reached
out
to
me
to
make
things
right,
as
they
were
concerned
with
my
satisfaction
of
their
product
they
replaced
the
ear
buds,
and
the
new
ones
work
perfectly
pairing
was
little
tricky,
but
with
little
patience
they
paired
on
the
third
try
would
recommend
these
to
anyone
who
wants
true
"wireless
bluetoothoriginal
review
0/0"not
the
best
experience"i
really
wanted
to
like
these
guys
however,
they
sounded
so
tinny
and
just
lacked
any
real
sound
the
other
real
problem
is
that
they
lost
connectivity
with
my
iphone,
and
would
just
randomly
disconnect
and
reconnect
within
seconds
these
are
absolutely
terrible
if
you
order
these,
you
will
be
very
disappointed
the
sounds
quality
is
terrible
you
will
be
much
better
off
sticking
with
the
wired
earbuds
you
currently
ownsomething
is
really
not
right
here
there
is
no
way
possible
this
product
can
have
so
many
five
star
reviews
something
is
amiss
the
sound
is
equivalent
to
am
radio
all
treble,
zero
bass
bought
them
as
gift
for
my
wife
and
cannot
even
express
the
disappointment
feel
about
these
when
placed
my
order,
there
were
well
over
0,0
star
reviews
for
this
product
simply
cannot
believe
people
would
think
this
is
great
product
we
tried
all
the
different
settings,
we
tried
all
the
different
attachments,
and
nothing
fixed
the
sounds
quality
issue
they
did
tend
to
fall
out
of
her
ears
also,
but
this
problem
was
nothing
compared
to
the
absolutely
abysmal
soundi
will
be
reaching
out
to
amazon
about
this
product
listing
truly
hope
they
can
test
the
product
themselves
and
get
to
the
bottom
of
this
this
type
of
listing
manipulation
is
very
bad
for
amazon
it
calls
into
question
the
reviews
on
other
amazon
products
i've
been
an
amazon
customer
since
the
early
days,
and
have
never
had
this
bad
of
misfire
sometimes
products
haven't
met
my
exceptions,
but
nothing
has
come
close
to
this
level
of
disappointment
edit:
0/0/0
these
puppies
are
cool
make
sure
to
try
the
different
sized
domes
you're
going
to
want
to
be
able
to
occlude
the
ear
canal
anyone
saying
there
is
no
bass
simply
does
not
have
them
fitted
correctly
when
the
ear
canal
is
occluded
with
the
correct
dome,
these
guys
put
out
some
bass
actually
with
an
equalizer,
can
get
too
much
bass

came

pods

believe
it
or
not

after
losing
apple
airpod
to

drain
opted
for
ear
buds,
something
little
more
secure
they
did
what
wanted
them
to
do,
stay
in
my
ear
during
read
reviews
that
said
the
bass
is
horrible
for
me
it
was
decent
no
audio
snob
my
biggest
complaint
is
the
super
cheap
rubber
tips
they
were
so
uncomfortable,
it
like
the
thinnest
piece
of
rubber
ever
couldn
get
good
picture
showing
how
thin
they
are
but
if
you
can
zoom
in
on
my
first
pictures
you
ll
see
what
mean
it
came
with
several
rubber
tips
so
tried
them
all
and
each
was
worse
than
the
last
the
audio
is
decent,
it
isn
going
to
knock
your
socks
off
but
it
good
for
bucks
gave
in
and
just
brought
some
bose
sound
sports
but
if
your
hesitant
to
spend
the
money
this
is
solid
option
and
if
it
doesn
work
out,
return
them
also
beware
of
some
of
the
other
reviews
so
this
is
my
first
ear
bud
set
and
can
honestly
say
that
am
impressed
with
these
bad
boys
here
one
thing
would
say
is
that
wished
it
wasn't
so
sensitive
to
the
touch
tough
wear
hoodies
while
workout
and
thenhoodie
keeps
pressing
against
it
changing
the
song
or
turning
the
ear
buds
off
smh
last
but
not
least
is
the
phone
quality
when
calling
could
use
some
work
but
overall,
love
them
:
so
ordered
these
as
an
alternative
to
my
current
headphones
made
by
sennheiser
because
wanted
something

the
fit
they
aren
super
comfortable
they
kinda
stick
out
in
weird
way
and
despite
trying
the
different
ear
fitting
pieces,
nothing
seemed
to
change
the
way
they
felt
additionally
they
don
really
attenuate
or
block
external
noise
at
all,
due
to
the
tenuous
fit0
sound
quality
an
audio
engineer
and
music
coach
by
trade
and
can
definitely
say
these
sit
solidly
in
entry
level
range
the
low
end
is
severely
lacking
my
applemade
earbuds
included
with
my
iphone
are
leaps
and
bounds
ahead
of
these
in
sound
quality
if
you
are
looking
for
balanced
representation
of
the
frequencies,
these
are
not
for
you0
the
controls
the
controls
aren
very
intuitive,
and
even
when
you
follow
the
directions
the
touch
sensitivity
only
word
half
the
time
the
way
it
designed
the
volume
is
particularly
difficult
to
adjust
effectively
and
consistently0
waterproofing
this
was
big
one
for
me
as
it
is
the
main
reason
bought
this
product
did
take
them
in
the
shower
to
test
their
useability,
and
wasn
completely
heartbroken
they
did
continue
to
function
in
the
shower,
without
shutting
down
or
sustaining
water
damage
however,
due
to
the
touch
control
features
on
the
side,
when
water
comes
into
contact
with
the
side
of
the
earbud,
various
features
are
accidentally
activated
track
changes,
volume
changes,
siri
activation,
etc
so
would
say
these
are
not
designed
to
be
used
with
swimming,
as
pictured
in
advertisement
may
indicate
the
sound
was
great,
but
beware,
if
you
drop
an
earbud
once
it
will
break,
making
that
earbud
unusable
these
ear
phones
are
amazing
my
favorite
thing
is
the
case
is
what
charges
them,
so
once
you
re
done
using
them,
put
them
back
in
the
case
and
they
automatically
turn
off
and
start
charging
ready
to
use
them
again
take
them
out
and
they
turn
on
and
pair
to
your
bluetooth
these
are
perfect
even
if
you
re
not
tech
savvy
sound
quality
is
amazing
very
clear
different
options
for
the
ear
bud
piece,
to
fit
perfectly
in
your
ear
the
way
you
want
sound
quality
is
decent
not
great,
but
not
the
worst
i've
ever
heard
same
for
comfort/fit
main
issue,
for
me,
was
the
connection
quality
could
repeatedly
cause
the
left
and
right
earpieces
to
disconnect
from
each
other
by
simply
yawning
despite
what
some
people
might
want
you
to
believe,
the
mere
presence
of
bluetooth
is
not
panacea
for
connection
issues
the
dropouts
were
so
annoying
to
me
that
returned
these
the
next
daymy
original
review,
as
appears
above,
gave
this
product
stars
updated
it
to
stars
today
because
the
manufacturer
reached
out
to
me
and
sent
me
new
pair
to
see
if
still
encountered
the
issues
encountered
with
the
original
set
that
i'd
returned
they
have
been
in
communication
with
me
all
week
to
try
and
pinpoint
the
cause
this
proactive
approach
to
customer
service
is,
frankly,
rare,
and
while
this
particular
product
wasn't
for
me
personally,
they
definitely
stand
behind
it
and
wouldn't
hesitate
to
give
'em
try
have
these,
airpods,
anker
soundcore
liberty
neos,
and
jabra
elites
these
are
the
worst
sounding
of
the
four
but
would
sound
better
than
the
soundcores
if
they
weren't
so
poorly
equalized
that
they
are
only
really
sound
good
for
voice
or
podcasts
without
significantly
reducing
sound
around
0hz0hz
and
bringing
up
anything
less
than
0hz
these
are
capable
of
putting
out
significant
bass,
but
without
an
equalizer
you
wouldn't
be
able
to
tell
can't
tell
if
it's
the
drivers
or
the
low
quality
sbc
codec
these
don't
support
aac
or
aptx
but
there
is
almost
no
high
end
to
boost
no
triangles,
no
high
hat
sizzles,
no
metallic
overtones
anywhere
equalizers
can't
help
therethe
case
is
twice
as
large
as
any
other
cases
i've
tried
which
makes
these
not
very
portable
because
the
case
is
necessary
to
turn
these
off
several
times,
i've
found
myself
stashing
these
directly
in
my
pocket
to
talk
to
somebody
only
to
find
out
accidentally
unpaused
podcast
and
lost
my
place
this
is
the
most
annoying
problem
besides
the
lackluster
audio
qualityspeaking
of
the
controls
the
touch
controls
register
maybe
0%
of
the
time,
and
when
they
do,
they
often
register
double
tap
rather
than
single
be
careful
if
you
have
any
moisture
on
your
fingers
because
drop
of
water
could
register
as
longpress
until
you
dry
them
offalso
annoying
is
that,
when
removed
from
the
case,
they
frequently
go
into
pairing
mode
when
they
should
simply
reconnect
to
my
phone
sitting
directly
next
to
the
buds
when
powering
on
the
easiest
solution
is
to
use
my
phone
settings
to
unpair
and
repair
or
put
the
buds
back
in
the
case
and
hope
they
reconnect
the
next
time
remove
themif
you
only
have
$0
and
know
how
to
use
an
equalizer,
then
these
are
fine
but
if
you
want
to
hear
hi
hats
and
bass
drums,
then
pick
up
the
jabra
elites
insteadat
any
price
i'd
buy
them

by
the
fact
that
you
will
have
tried
out
all
available
ear
tip
sizes
and
all
have
come
out
sounding
tinny
or
lacking
bassin
lieu
of
that,
be
sure
to
actually
try
getting
the
thing
fit
properly,
because
that
makes
whole
world
of
differenceso,
my
final
review
of
this
is
that
the
product
is
actually
pretty
great
did
end
up
having
to
return
these
not
because
they
were
bad
product,
but
rather
wasn't
using
it
as
much
as
had
initially
hoped
didn't
want
these
lying
around
and
collecting
dust
after
allthe
sound
quality
of
these
earbuds
are
undoubtedly
good
regarding
the
price
you
get
these
for
i'm
not
kidding
around
either,
being
an
experienced
budget
audio
equipment
user
the
bass
is
very
present,
and
not
muddy
at
all,
and
the
mids
and
highs
have
some
strange,
but
welcome
clarity
to
them
in
fact,
the
sound
quality
of
these
almost
closely
match
my
old
favorite
pair
of
bluetooth
headphones,
the
sony
mdr0bt,
very
solid,
but
discontinued
pair
of
onear
headphonesthe
build
quality
of
the
earbuds
and
case
is
pretty
solid
the
case
is
little
bit
beefy,
but
find
that
to
be
non
issue
considering
that
if
it
were
any
lighter
the
winds
could
probably
pick
it
up
and
blow
it
to
place
don't
need
it
going
as
careful
individual
don't
think
have
dropped
the
case
but
the
worse
that
could
happen
is
that
it
opens
thanks
to
the
magnets
that
hold
the
earpieces
to
the
charging
prongs,
you'd
probably
have
to
deliberately
throw
the
thing
to
get
them
to
pop
outas
for
the
earbuds
themselves,
may
have
accidentally
dropped
from
time
to
time,
but
they
haven't
broken
apart
at
all
not
that
recommend
dropping
them
in
the
first
placeinitial
review:the
first
day
of
any
product
is
always
hit
or
miss
for
me,
but
i'm
going
to
be
using
these
for
week
or
so
to
give
it
more
proper
review
have
never
had
wireless
ones
stay
in
my
ear
or
that
didn't
hurt
before
getting
these
am
so
freaking
happy
with
these
pairing
was
no
brainier
easy
to
accept
calls,
pause
music
or
books
with
simple
tap
stays
put
with
all
my
movement
charges
great
and
quickly
pretty
much
wear
one
at
time
and
change
them
out
every
few
hours
to
more
give
my
ear
rest
then
battery
life
when
talking
on
phone
others
say
am
crystal
clear
and
no
tunnel
sound
love
these
the
old
saying
you
get
what
you
pay
for
does
not
apply
here
these
headphones
have
so
far
performed
well
above
the
expectation
of
their
price
point
they
are
extremely
simple
to
use
simply
take
them
out
of
their
port
and
connect
the
sound
quality
is
good,
and
they
fit
perfectly,
and
comfortably
for
me,
there
was
no
need
to
change
out
the
silicone
pieces
but
they
come
with
good
variety
of
sizes
love
all
the
different
things
can
do
with
tap
or
two
on
the
earpieces
wasn't
expecting
them
to
be
able
to
field
phone
calls,
change
the
song,
raise/lower
the
volume
they
do
wiggle
some
during
my
workout
which
is
the
main
reason
purchased
them
but
not
terribly,
and
sweat
lot
haven't
tried
switching
out
the
silicone
pieces
to
see
if
it
lowers
the
wiggle
yet,
as
it
is
manageable
one
thing
haven't
checked
out
is
the
distance
they
stay
connected
to
my
phone
i'm
within
few
feet
of
my
phone
for
all
my
workouts
overall,
highly
recommend
these
earphones
to
those
looking
for
new,
reasonably
priced
pair
for
everyday
use
customer
service
is
awesome
from
this
seller

my
only
want
for

and
it
worked

recommended
affordable

and
great

use
this
mostly
while
traveling
and
was
amazed
how
something
so
light
can
provide
such
great
sound
quality
cancels
all
outside
noise
and
has
the
sound
of
bose
without
the
price
these
really
blew
me
away
also
has
great
warranty
though
doubt
will
need
to
use
it,
working
great
so

great

also
can
walk

am
an
apple

and
have
been
considering
getting
wireless
earbuds
came
across
these
and
they
seemed
to
be
great
alternative
must
say
that
am
quite
impressed
by
them
they
are
easy
to

fit

and
hold
in

running
the

can

bank
sound
is
great
for
the
price
highly
recommend
these
use
these
at
work
in
an
industrial
environment
bought
third
party
foam
tips
so
that
they
have
good
noise
cancelling
they
work
really
well
with
those
tips,
but
not
sure
how
isolating
the
included
tips
would
work
in
that
environmenti
listen
to
talk
podcasts
and
such
almost
exclusively
and
they
sound
fine
music
leaves
something
to
be
desired,
but
dont
know
how
they
compare
to
other
wireless
buds
with
music
qualitythey
last
about
hours
on
charge
and
can
recharge
in
about
minutesthe
charging
station
lasts
me
over
week
and
charge
the
earbuds
or
times
during
the
dayi
wish
they
could
last
all
day
on
single
charge
but
that
is
just
the
current
state
of
wireless
earbud
tech
right
now
note:
i've
had
these
for
about
week
now,
so
if
need
to
come
back
and
update
this,
willthese
are
true
wireless
bluetooth
earbuds,
with
absolutely
no
wires
have
never
even
had
regular
wireless
headphones,
so
wasn't
sure
what
to
expect
the
charging
case
feels
sturdy
and
looks
polished
like
that
it
has
carrying
pouch,
but
do
wish
it
had
longer
charging
cord
it's
maybe
0"
longi'm
one
of
those
that
likes
to
read
instructions,
so
that's
the
first
thing
did
they
seemed
to
be
pretty
comprehensive,
with
some
troubleshooting
tips,
and
easy
to
follow
when
first
took
the
earbuds
out
of
the
charging
case,
it
seemed
as
though
they
both
paired
with
my
phone,
but
only
had
sound
in
the
right
ear
followed
the
instructions,
which
suggested
that
"forget"
the
earbuds,
put
them
in
the
case,
and
then
try
again
and
that
worked
perfectlythe
charging
case
stores
these
with
help
from
magnet,
which
appreciate
as
someone
who
is
accidentprone
like
that
the
indicator
lights
on
the
case
are
easy
to
understand
have
not
had
the
chance
to
fully
test
the
life
of
the
battery,
but
from
my
previous
research,
if
it
is
truly
hours,
that's
the
middle
of
the
pack
when
it
comes
to
these
style
of
earbudslike
others
have
mentioned,
there
isn't
lot
of
bass
with
these,
but
also
wasn't
looking
for
lot
was
looking
for
balanced
sound
and
was
pretty
easily
able
to
achieve
that
with
the
earbuds
and
with
using
the
music
app
on
my
phone
was
very
pleasantly
surprised
with
the
sound
volume
it
plays
very
loudly,
if
you
want
it
to
also
like
that
there
were
multiple
sizes
of
rubber
tips
to
use
with
the
earbuds
included
so
you
can
customize
the
best
fiti
haven't
yet
tested
the
phone
call
capabilities,
but
will
update
this
if
get
the
chance
to
use
that
capabilityone
minor
disappointment
was
that
the
range
of
the
earbuds
from
the
phone
was
on
the
low
end
of
what
i've
seen
with
bluetooth
couldn't
walk
even
all
the
way
across
my
apartment
without
the
connection
dropping
however,
what
did
appreciate
was
that
when
walked
back
to
within
range,
the
earbuds
automatically
picked
the
connection
right
back
upoverall,
so
far
i'd
say
that
for
the
price,
these
are
great
set
of
basic
true
wireless
earbuds,
and
the
price
can't
be
beat
hopefully
they
will
hold
up
with
time,
and
if
they
do
then
they'll
be
real
great
value
put
them
in
my
ears
and
immediatly
took
them
off
the
sound
was
awful
very
strong
midrange
distortion
and
zero
absolutely
zero
bass
the
worst
headphone
i've
ever
heard
shame
because
comfort
was
decent
price
is
obviously
incrediblefor
the
price
they
are
good
guess
but
no
matter
the
sound
quality
is
so
bad
for
my
taste
just
can't
i've
got
$0
sol
republic
headphones
that
smoke
this
don't
know
how
the
reviews
are
high
they
must
not
know
what
good
audio
isi'm
not
big
complainer
either
i've
had
multiple
issues
with
this
one
the
left
earbud
broke
not
long
after
use,
giving
staticlike
hiss
at
high
frequencies
other
earbuds
own
do
not
do
this,
so
know
anyone
would
run
into
this
problemto
make
matters
worse,
the
earpiece
is
difficult
to
angle
in
your
ear
and
leaves
you
feeling
extremely
frustratedi
had
to
finesse
it
so
much,
infact,
that
the
silicone
eartip
dislodged
and
had
to
dig
it
out
of
my
ear
with
toothpick
the
silicone
tip
was
cheap
itself
and
the
connection
to
the
earbud
easily
came
off
as
welli
bought
these
to
have
the
option
to
charge
other
devices
with
it,
but
i'd
rather
just
have
functional
pair
of
earbuds+
charging
case
holds
large
charge
and
lets
you
power
other
devices
cheap
silicone
earpiece
terrible
ear
design
makes
it
difficult
to
hear
unless
you
position
it
just
right
personally,
didn't
like
the
touch
feature
it
sounds
good
in
writing,
but
you
can
easily
skip
when
you
mean
to
pause
defective
left
earbud
had
to
finesse
it
in
my
ear
so
much
the
silicon
earpiece
lodged
in
my
ear
due
to
the
design,
when
cleaning
off
earwax
the
mesh
screen
also
came
off
glad
that
didn't
fall
in
my
ear
as
wellall
around
terrible
their
customer
service
was
nice
and
helpful
too
bad
their
product
was
godawful
first
off,
the
sound
is
pretty
good
for
their
size,
and
they
fit
snugly
in
place
once
you
find
the
right
plug
size
the
earbuds
also
do
last
for
around
four
hours
of
listening
time,
with
very
good
amount
of
standby
time,
so
even
if
you
pause
something
on
your
phone
it
won't
keep
running
the
battery
down
as
normal
but
there
are
problems
to
be
foundfirst
off,
the
audioonly
indications
become
really
annoying,
demanding
you
to
charge
them
without
giving
any
indication
how
much
charge
is
left,
or
commanding
you
to
stop
holding
finger
to
them
something
about
the
voice
is
less
status
indicator
and
more
fussy
mom
must
be
the
tone
another
annoying
"feature"
is
that
there's
no
way
to
use
the
right
earbud
on
its
own,
because
only
the
left
one
will
sync
with
devices
speaking
ofthis
will
only
sync
with
devices
that
do
not
require
passcode
making
them
backwardsincompatable
with
older
bt
transmitters,
but
that's
not
uncommon
nor
will
it
sync
with
devices
that
require
button
press
to
sync
which
can
be
very
annoying
so
about
half
the
things
bought
the
damn
things
for,
such
as
my
ps
vita
and
bt
transmitter
for
my
switch,
are
just
flatout
unusableadditionally,
the
recharging
base
which
also
acts
as
battery
in
emergencies
is
weird
little
scrot
apparently
dropping
from
dots
"full"
to
dots
"""""""half""""""full"
means
its
almost
dead
i've
found
this
out
few
times
when
recharging
the
earbuds
its
really
frustrating,
as
apparently
even
in
manufacturers
can't
get
this
simple,
basic
system
of
telling
power
levels
right
either
that
or
the
battery
is
worse
than
advertised
and
i'm
lucky
it
hasn't
exploded
inside
the
casealso,
have
doubts
about
how
many
times
it
actually
recharged
the
earbuds
before
needing
to
be
plugged
in
itself,
but
cannot
confirm
this
as
have
yet
to
count
the
exact
number
of
times
i've
stuck
them
on
to
recharge,
and
sometimes
they
were
halfdischarged,
so
meh
that
gets
passall
in
all,
the
sound
and
convenience
are
the
only
real
positives
for
these
earbuds
but
you
get
what
you
pay
for,
and
these
are
on
the
cheaper
end
of
the
current
at
time
of
purchase
wireless
earbud
scale
at
least
they
aren't
airpods,
guessupdate
oct0:
and
now
they
won't
even
stay
active
long
enough
to

despite
apparently
having
full

since

placed
on

the

seconds
then
shuts
off,
even
when
the

however,
upon
removing
them,
they
blink
for
about
five

before

my
0$
is
now
confirmed
to
have
been
spent
on
complete
junk
definitely
don't
buy
these
updated:
ordered
these
earbuds
based
on
the
reviews
it
had
received
on
amazon
was
looking
to
replace
pair
of
zolo
liberty
earbuds
and
save
little
money
esp
since
the
pasonomi
appeared
to
be
rated
higher
this
is
actually
my
second
pair
of
these
earbuds
as
the
first
pair
received
had
some
audio
issueslikes:
really
liked
the
idea
that
could
use
the
case
to
charge
other
devices
easy
to
see
indicators
on
charging
status
overall
build
quality
seemed
decent
pairing
was
pretty
easy
too
and
i've
had
no
dropouts
so
far
sound
quality
is
good
and
they
get
surprisingly
loud
compared
to
others
i've
tried
battery
life
is
also
good,
lasting
several
hours
on
single
charge
they
also
have
exceptional
customer
service
more
on
that
in
momentdislikes:
these
did
not
fit
my
ear
nearly
as
well
as
would
have
liked,
despite
trying
several
different
tips
in
full
disclosure,
use
the
largest
tips
to
help
isolate
outside
noise,
but
even
the
largest
tip
didn't
quite
work
for
my
left
ear
but
that
is
not
entirely
unusual
for
me
either
i've
run
into
this
before
with
other
earphones
and
earplugs
for
that
matter
additionally,
the
mic
quality
could
be
better
for
making
calls
where
my
wife
said
she
had
hard
time
hearing
me
with
these
onto
be
fair,
these
are
about
$0
cheaper
than
another
midrange
earbud
that
use,
so
it's
not
unreasonable
to
expect
some
differences
overallcustomer
service:
as
noted
earlier,
there
were
some
issues
with
the
initial
set
of
earbuds
received
at
first
was
disappointed
that
would
have
to
return
them
and
pay
the
shipping
to
do
so,
but
when
shared
my
concerns
with
the
seller,
they
immediately
reached
out
and
bent
over
backwards
to
make
everything
right
they
refunded
everything
and
shipped
me
another
pair
quickly
to
try
again
they
really
went
above
and
beyond
probably
the
best
customer
service
i've
experienced
with
any
online
purchase
they
truly
want
you
to
be
happy
with
the
purchase
that
is
for
certain
like
everyone
else
ve
been
trying
to
find
good
set
of
earbuds
so
far
can
say
found
them
no
there
not
beats
or
apple
buds
ect
but
they
do
just
fine
like
the
fact
that
they
re
wireless,
they
don
fall
out
my
ear
the
music
is
good
the
bass
is
good
when
received
phone
call
or
when
make
call
people
can
hear
me
perfectly
fine
with
no
complaints
can
use
one
earbud
separate
or
can
use
them
both
they
automatically
connect
with
no
problems
it
has
good
battery
life
had
this
for
going
on
two
weeks
fully
charged
the
case
and
have
not
recharge
the
case
since
got
it
and
it
been
holding
charge
quite
well
only
small
down
fall
not
0%

on
the

cancellation
it
doesn
completely
isolate
the
outside
sound,
but
that
is
still
ok
and
people
can
still
hear
me
also
when
the
earbuds
stay
in
my
ear
for
long
time
they
can
be
little
uncomfortable
but
overall
am
very
satisfied
with
these
earbuds
okay,
so,
i've
been
using
this
product
for
while
now,
so
here's
my
review
with
lists
of
pros
and
cons:pros:0
sound
quality
is
pretty
good,
i'll
say0
connection
is
really
easy0
can
walk
way
from
the
connected
device
and
mostly
fine
with
connectivity
this
definitely
depends
on
your
devices
though;
can
walk
farther
away
when
they
are
connected
to
my
laptop,
but
not
quite
far
when
connected
to
my
phone0
not
gonna
lie,
more
stylish
than
thought
when
ordered
this
product0
they
sit
well
even
when
you
are
active
i've
done
running
and
jumping
with
these
headphones
in
my
ears0
easy
battery
charging
additionally,
the
case
that
also
functions
as
an
exterior
battery
is
quite
convenient
since
you
don't
need
another
outlet
to
charge
them0
great
customer
service
had
problem
with
my
first
pair
about
weeks
after
my
purchase,
and
they
replaced
the
old
ones
with
new
pair
without
any
question
asked
you
also
have
an
option
get
refund
insteadcons:0
charging
is
easy,
but
the
battery
life
of
the
headphones
itself
is
not
the
best
maybe
should've
read
the
description
more
carefully
or
done
more
research,
but
the
battery
life
of
the
headphones
alone
is
probably
0~0
hours
you
can
charge
them
easily
for
sure,
but
probably
not
the
best
headphones
if
you're
someone
who
is
on
your
headphones
for
long
time
all
day
ie
often
read
or
study
with
music
on
for
hours
without
stopping0
this
may
depend
on
devices,
but
the
maximum
volume
is
not
that
loud
when
connected
to
phones,
but
it
can
get
louder
when
connected
to
laptops
so
it
looks
like
how
loud
the
maximum
volume
of
each
device
you
use
is
determines
how
loud
sound
these
headphones
can
provide
withdo
recommend
them
yes
compared
to
the
price,
think
they
are
great
but,
if
you
are
someone
who
sits
down
with
your
headphones
on
for
long
time
ie
college
student,
also
recommend
you
to
get
wired
headphones
so
that
you
won't
have
to
pause
all
of
your
sound
while
charging
your
pair
update:
found
out
inside
the
box
that
they
give
three
month
warranty
so
i'll
update
you
guys
once
find
out
if
the
warranty
works
after
reading
several
reviews
and
comparing
these
headphones
to
other
headphones
around
that
same
price
decided
to
go
with
this
unknown
name
when
first
got
them
they
seem
to
work
great
after
month
my
left
one
was
not
as
loud
as
my
right
one
and
it
was
considerably
noticeable
called
amazon
and
try
to
get
ahold
of
them
but
they
couldn't
do
nothing
for
me
so
guess
i'm
stuck
with
them
basically
one
works
at
level
the
other
works
at
level
volume
these
are
not
used
to
me
like
that
would
recommend
corn
with
name
brand
bought
these
and
they
were
great
for
few
months
you
can
take
them
out
of
the
carrier,
place
them
in
your
ears,
and
hear
sound
with
some
nice
silicon
dampening
the
microphone
quality
for
calls
was
inconsistent
and
often
poor,
but
bought
these
mostly
to
listen,
and
they
did
well
for
about
months
after
months,
problems
started:
the
left
bud
wouldn't
sync
with
the
right
bud
and
just
be
quiet
the
left
bud
would
actually
connect
to
the
right
bud
and
kick
my
phone
off
the
right
bud
would
sync
with
the
left
bud
and
both
would
shut
down
each
would
independently
beep
indefinitely
until
returned
them
to
the
case
and
tried
againi
could
solve
this
once
in
while
by
going
through
an
elaborate
sync/reset
procedure,
but
that
lasted
until
the
next
time
returned
them
to
the
case
and
tried
again
the
overhead
to
put
these
in
was
several
minutes
of
frustrated
insertion,
removal,
and
returning
to
the
case,
repeat
until
functionali'm
very
disappointed
with
this
product,
and
strongly
regret
purchasing
it
i've
been
searching
forever
to
find
something
to
fit
my
small
ears
finally
pasonomi
came
through
for
me
and
was
totally
satisfied
with
these
earbuds
at
first
actually
still
am,
it's
just
unfortunate
that
the
right
earbud
stopped
connecting
and
playing
even
after
resetting
them
checking
online
blogs
it
seems
this
is
an
ongoing
problem
with
this
specific
set
of
earbuds
mean
everything
about
these
earbuds
was
just
awesome
but
then
that
happened
i've
been
waiting
for
day
and
half
to
hear
back
from
pasonomi
via
fb
messenger
about
solution
or
replacement
i'll
update
this
post
later
after
hear
from
the
company
would
slam
them
but
they
fit
so
good
so
just
can't
you
big
eared
peeps
might
want
to
steer
clear
of
this
set
of
earbuds
update
0:
pasonomi
messaged
me
back
and
offered
replacement
earbuds
i'm
not
clear
if
they
are
only
replacing
the
right
one
or
the
entire
set
i'll
update
this
post
when
find
out
more
so
here's
my
update
got
the
new
earbuds
the
day
they
said
would
receive
them
followed
the
instructions
and
connected
them
and
just
like
the
last
pair
they
are
simply
amazing
would
purchase
these
again
and
againas
long
as
they
keep
their
return
policy
the
first
time
got
them,
they
worked
great
for
about
month
the
right
ear
piece
no
longer
charged
or
worked
company
sent
me
replacement
the
replacement
has
worked
well
sometimes
the
sound
cuts
out
even
when
not
away
from
my
phone,
but
returns
quickly
that
doesn
really
bother
me
use
them
for
about
hrs
days
week
at
the
gym
rather
have
these
than
have
to
pay
$0
for
airpods
the
company
has
reached
out
to
me
more
than
once
to
make
sure
am
satisfied
can
find
that
kind
of
customer
service
too
often
these
days
really
appreciate
that
that
why
give
this
product
stars
customer
service
makes
all
the
difference
am
confident
that
if
have
any
future
problems,
even
after
the
return
time,
they
would
be
more
than
willing
to
help
me

updateearbuds
going
out
again
as
always,
it
the
right
one
guess
expected
it
think
had
them
less
than
year
all
lol
but
still,
good
customer
service
since
they
sent
me
replacements
free
of
charge
just
wish
they
actually
kept
working
waited
few
weeks
to
leave
my
review
after
reading
the
prior
reviews
about
battery
life,
dropping
calls,
sound
quality
diminishing
after
the
first
few
days
can
honestly
say
after
using
them
for
over
two
weeks
now
both
left
and
right
ear
bud
have
worked
perfect
since
day
one
connects
very
quick
&
easy
after
reading
instructions
sound
and
call
quality
is
wonderful
wasn
expecting
them
to
have
so
much
bass
was
pleasantly
surprised
no
static
whatsoever
they
are
waterproof
having
the
option
to
pause/play
songs,
also
call
just
from
tap
on
earbud
is
amazing
also
love
that
can
use
only
one
ear
bud
they
are
great
at
noise
cancelling
so
when
need
to
be
aware
of
my
surroundings,
only
put
the
left
or
right
one
in
and
it
works
flawlessly
the
case
doubles
as
power
pack
which
is
an
added
bonus
have
also
used
it
to
charge
my
iphone
battery
life
is
remarkable
carrying
pouch
has
been
lifesaver
when
on
the
go
includes
few
different
size
ear
cushions
so
you
can
choose
perfect
fit
for
your
ears
they
are
very
light
weight
&
comfortable
haven
had
any
problems
with
shifting/moving
after
putting
them
in
range
is
great
too
overall,
very
happy
with
my
purchase
you
won
be
disappointed
these
are
pretty
decent
entry
level
truewireless
headsettl:dr
for
the
price
these
are
great
value
they
don't
compete
well
with
$0
and
up
high
end
units,
but
they
have
crisp
and
clean
sound
and
pair
easily
after
first
pairingthese
wireless
earbuds
pretty
great
deal
for
the
priceit
took
minute
to
get
them
paired
the
first
time
had
to
cycle
bt
on
my
phone
once
but
after
the
initial
pairing
the
connected
instantly
upon
pulling
them
out
of
their
casethe
case
is
nice
0mah
charger
for
the
buds
and
they
pop
into
position
magnetically
so
they
don't
have
problem
charging
or
being
misaligned
it
can
also
act
as
an
emergency
battery
for
your
phone,
but
didn't
test
thatthe
sound
quality
is
good,
they
are
on
par
with
other
earbuds
in
the
<$0
price
range
the
low
end
is
little
thin,
but
that
seems
normal
for
inear
buds
overall
the
sound
was
crisp
and
clear
when
listening
to
music
or
taking
call
nobody
had
trouble
understanding
methey
are
lightweight
and
had
no
problems
with
them
staying
in
place
even
when
working
outi
run
at
decently
fast
pace
and
i've
had
problems
with
buds
falling
out
in
the
past
these
are
light
enough
that
they
didn't
want
to
fall
out
also,
the
kit
comes
with
different
sizes
for
ear
cushions
so
you
should
be
able
to
find
snug
fitthese
aren't
sold
as
noise
cancelling,
but
they
do
block
out
good
amount
of
ambient
noise
because
of
where
they
sit
in
your
earthe
best
feature
discovered
that
wasn't
well
advertised
is
that
you
can
use
just
one
if
you
pull
only
the
left
bud
out
of
the
case,
it
will
pair
with
your
phone
and
you
can
use
it
for
taking
calls
or
if
you
want
to
exercise
but
still
have
awareness
additionally,
if
you
remove
the
right
bud
only
it
can
be
paired
as
separate
device
so
you
could
use
that
standalone
as
well
using
only
one
bud
limits
the
control
scheme
little,
but
it's
super
cool
ideathe
controls
are
pretty
responsive
touch
only,
no
buttons
but
they
take
some
getting
used
to
in
order
to
learn
the
right
amount
of
pressure
and
timing
to
activate
them

at

they
sounded

had

within
about

have
hung

just
by
trying

virtually
all

can

is

is

quality
had
several
calls
where
just
abandoned
the
buds
all
together
because
the
caller
couldn't
hear
me
well
note
this
was
while
was
in
my
car,
absent
wind
or
ambient
noiseat
this
point
this
is
an
underpowered,
over
priced
battery
pack
no
not
buy
have
tried
several
kinds
of
wireless
earbuds,
and
have
found
most
of
them
to
have
pretty
bad
sound
quality
was
completely
blown
away
by
the
sound
on
these
have
been
missing
my
wired
earbuds
ever
since
got
new
phone
without
an
audio
jack,
but
don't
think
will
be
missing
them
anymore
these
sound
even
better
than
my
old
wired
ones
don't
know
how
they
did
it,
but
these
sound
almost
more
like
you're
listening
to
speaker
than
earbuds
was
so
impressed
made
my
mom
and
my
boyfriend
both
try
them,
they
agreed
that
they
were
remarkably
goodanother
nice
feature
is
their
charging
box,
it
charged
my
phone
very
quickly
and
has
kept
the
earbuds
charged
very
well
have
used
the
earbuds
pretty
much
all
day
at
work
for
two
days
and
charged
my
phone
once
charged
the
box
for
about
two
hours
while
took
the
earbuds
to
the
gym
with
me,
just
to
see
if
they
would
stay
in
while
went
for
run
they
didn't
move
around
at
all
and
stayed
paired
with
my
phone
when
put
it
down
to
do
things
like
weightsalso,
did
not
think
i'd
use
the
tap
controls
on
the
earbuds
because
usually
it's
just
easier
to
use
my
phone
however,
while
using
them
at
the
gym
it
turned
out
to
be
very
helpful
to
change
songs
didn't
want
to
listen
to
and
it
worked
very
wellanother
thing
appreciated
is
that
the
earbuds
and
case
were
both
fully
charged
when
they
arrived
and
the
earbuds
paired
really
easily
the
voice
telling
you
they
paired
with
your
phone
is
not
at
all
irritating,
and
helpful
in
that
you
don't
have
to
worry
about
thinking
your
earbuds
are
connected
when
they
aren't
and
blasting
your
music
on
accident
for
the
price
was
fairly
impressed

noted
small

most

bluetooth
fundamental,
when
put
the
earphone
that
connected
first
back
into
the

they
stop
playing

when
this
happens
just
put
them
both
into
the
case
for
seconds
and
pull
out
the
one
wanted
then
it
connects
instantly
not
really
problem
in
my
opinion0
am
sure
other
earphones
have
carrying
case
that
is
both
charger
and
carrying
case,
but
really
like
being
able
to
charge
them
on
the
go,
knowing
that
when
pull
them
out
of
the
case
it
is
charged0
the
sound
quality
at
first
was
bad
for
me
>>>>
however,
when
it
switched
the
tip
to
the
next
largest
size
the
bass
and
music
quality
greatly
increased
<<<<
if
you
experience
poor
sound,
try
changing
the
tips
they
provided
several
sizes0
they
are
not
very
heavy
in
my
opinion,
forgot
they
were
in
my
ears
within
minutes,
they
feel
no
different
than
an
ordinary
earphone
with
cord
hanging
off
of
them
except
there
is
no
cord
yay0
cant
hear
anyone
around
with
me
with
music
on
around

if
can
hear
them,
they
are

didn't
get
any
cracking
or
popping
of
the

on
0%
volume
listening
to
edm
my
music
of
choice,
however
listening
to
the
piano
on
these
was
treat,
as
well0
believe
these
are
ipx0
and
are
water
rated
to
depth
of
meter
for
minutes
same
as
my
smartwatch
so
will
be
taking
these
through
some
water
and
will
see
what
the
experience
isoverall
am
very
surprised
am
glad
bought
these
thus
far
if
anything
changes
will
update
these
earbuds
were
something
i've
always
wanted
but
were
skeptical
because
was
so
used
to
wired
headphones
and
wasn't
sure
if
they
would
stay
inside
my
ears
was
totally
wrong
these
earbuds
are
able
to
be
bluetooth
to
any
bluetooth
device
you
own,
for
me,
connect
them
to
my
laptop
and
my
mobile
phone
was
impressed
that
they
actually
fit
perfectly
inside
my
ears
and
they
are
super
comfortable
too,
too
comfortable
in
the
fact
that
keep
forgetting
there
inside
my
ears
love
the
sound
quality
too
they
definitely
do
cancel
out
any
surrounding
noises
and
that
is
plus
when
am
at
the
gym
working
out
and
just
wanted
to
listen
to
my
music
without
any
distractions
they
are
cute,
fashionable
and
they
are
perfectly
fitted
to
my
ears
i'm
totally
sold
now
with
the
wireless
buds,
don't
think
could
go
back
to
the
wire
headphones
for
with
those,
you
risk
losing
sound
from
the
tangled
wires
with
these,
you
don't
really
have
to
worry
about
losing
sound
because
they
are
good
quality
buds,
they
last
long
time
when
charged
another
thing
like
is
the
charging
case
when
you're
finished
using
the
earbuds,
safely
set
them
back
in
it's
charging
case
and
you're
good
say
goodbye
to
the
old
fashion
wired
headsets
folks,
cause
wireless
is
where
it's
at
with
today's
new
phones
not
having
the
input
for
wired
headphones,
you'll
end
up
needed
the
wireless
headsets
anyways
and
with
these,
you'll
love
em
have
small
ears
and
small
earholes
the
headphones
that
wrap
around
the
ear
were
too
big
for
me
and
kept
falling
out
when
run
so
decided
to
try
these
i'm
so
happy
to
say
that
the
fit
is
awesome
and
i'm
incredibly
pleased
with
the
sound
quality
regularly
use
them
for
two
hours
and
have
never
had
problem
with
them
losing
their
charge
charge
the
case
after
two
or
three
uses
although
could
wait
longeri
had
problem
with
the
charging
case;
it's
started
rejecting
one
earbud
as
though
the
inner
magnet
that
attracts
the
ear
bud
to
stay
in
the
case
had
flipped
or
something
the
earbud
kept
popping
up
and
although
the
lid
for
the
case
would
push
it
back
down
it
didn't
seem
to
be
charging
as
well
as
the
other
one
emailed
the
seller
and
they
were
super
quick
about
responding
and
sent
me
replacement
immediately,
which
arrived
in
two
days
overall
i'm
very
satisfied
and
definitely
recommend
this
product
would
also
be
happy
to
buy
from
this
company
again
originally
purchased
these
as
birthday
gift
for
my
husband
tested
them
out
for
few
days
before
wrapping
them
up
and
absolutely
fell
in
love
purchased
pair
for
myself
just
few
days
later
they
are
remarkably
comfortable
and
the
sound
quality
is
amazing
bass
is
deep,
vocals
are
clear
and
ambient
noise
is
practically
cancelled
wore
these
to
family/friends
day
at
the
air
show
and
we
were
pretty
close
to
the
jets;
these
worked
better
than
the
foam
earplugs
to
dull
the
noise
the
controls
work
well
tapping/holding
the
earbud
to
pause,
next,
ect
although
it
is
bit
sensetive
for
example,
if
tuck
my
hair
behind
my
ear,
the
song
may
pause
if
touch
them
accidentally
i've
used
them
for
calls
time
or
two
and
could
be
heard
on
the
other
end
without
problem
tho
i've
never
used
them
to
charge
my
phone
it's
nice
to
have
the
option
since
carry
these
in
my
bag,
but
not
portable
chargeri
wear
these
pretty
casually,
but
my
husband
wears
them
about
days
week
while
at
the
gym
for
about
two
hours
at
time
he
did
have
an
issue
after
months
of
use
with
one
of
the
buds
being
near
silent
and
the
other
playing
perfectly
reached
out
to
the
company
via
email
and
they
wrote
back
immediately
and
offered
replacement
along
with
video
tutorial
of
how
to
fix
the
issue
we
tried
the
video
fix
first
and
were
able
to
get
the
bud
working
again
month
later,
the
same
issue
in
the
same
bud
reappeared
but
the
video
fix
did
not
work
reached
out
to
the
company
again
and
they
offered
to
send
an
immediate
replacement
you
can
tell
that
they
stand
by
their
product
and
take
pride
in
their
design
they've
certainly
earned
our
loyalty
ordering
more
as
gifts
in
the
upcoming
year
lets
get
to
the
facts
and
my
personal
oppinions
tried
pairing
my
cell
phone
first
lg
k0
plus
with
my
cell
phone
felt
like
the
bass
was
under
powered
ecspecially
when
listening
to
music
but
this
was
specifically
with
this
device
and
with
quick
and
easy
download
of
"mixer"
app
it
was
easily
fixed
do
have
this
issue
with
just
about
every
headphone
use
because
love
bass
over
all
secondly
paired
this
device
with
my
laptop
"
hp
laptop
0da0xxx"
did
have
issue
getting
sound
after
pairing
but
after
quick
and
easy
google
search
all
you
have
to
do
to
fix
that
is
go
into
your
sound
settings
and
make
the
device
your
default
output
device
and
no
more
issues
will
occur
did
join
the
"vip
program"
and
when
the
manufacturer
emailed
me
back
the
next
day
they
asked
how
was
enjoying
the
device
and
informed
them
of
this
issue
they
emailed
me
back
again
the
following
day
and
did
take
proactive
approach,
unfortunately
the
holidays
hit
and
they
have
yet
to
respond
which
is
understandable
the
manufacturer
is
clearly
overseas
im
in
usa
due
to
them
emailing
at
around
0:0
am
so
all
in
all
the
company
seems
proactive
in
the
care
and
concerns
of
its
customers
the
volume
level
of
the
device
is
awesome
me
personally
the
louder
the
better
which
is
probably
why
cant
hear
like
used
to
the
bass/treble
work
beautiful
together
depending
on
the
device
due
to
my
cell
needing
mixer
and
my
laptop
not
aside
for
the
initial
"set
up"
they
work
beautifully
again
depending
on
the
device
but
from
my
experiance
quick
and
easy
fixes
all
in
all
thoroughly
enjoy
these
headphones
now
in
regards
to
the
case/portable
charger
for
your
phone
the
lid
on
the
case
when
opened
feels
little
flimsy
like
it
could
pop
off
easily
with
that
being
said
it
also
looks
like
it
could
pop
back
on
even
easier
the
"charger"
didnt
really
charge
it
more
kept
my
phone
from
dieing
and
kept
it
at
the
same
battery
percentage
as
was
using
my
phone
that
is
the
only
reason
am
giving
this
and
not
stars
is
due
to
the
charger
not
really
charging
my
phone
but
keeping
in
from
dieing
while
in
use
the
case
comes
with
battery
big
enough
to
charge
any
phone
at
least
0%,
reserve
power
doesn't
do
great
job
on
noise
cancellation,
can
hear
ambient
noise
well
even
with
volume
set
to
high
music
output
quality
is
great
though,
strong
bass
and
clear
vocals
these
buds
also
work
with
phone
in
my
bag
or
back
pocket,
no
range
problems
there,
the
touch
button
controls
take
time
to
memorize
them
and
get
used
to
thoughalthough,
bought
the
same
bluetooth
earbuds
last
year,
this
says
version
but
there's
no
any
difference
between
them
both,
bt
nad
0mah,
little
confused
honestly
ended
up
loving
these
earbuds
way
more
than
expected
to
they
paired
to
my
phone
instantly
and
rarely
have
any
issues
with
keeping
them
paired
with
each
other
or
the
phone
as
for
the
sound
qualitytotally
floored
at
first
was
bit
disappointed
because
they
sounded
bit
hollow
and
had
no
real
bass
to
them,
but
then
swapped
out
the
rubber
ear
plugs
for
tighter
fit
with
the
ones
they
provided
and
bam
they
sound
absolutely
amazing
love
them
the
design
is
great
too
they
don't
stick
super
far
out
and
aren't
heavy
at
all
they
fit
my
ear
really
nicely
and
don't
jiggle
they
haven't
fallen
out
in
any
of
my
runs
either
low
profile
and
secure
in
addition
that
bonus
of
using
the
case
as
back
up
charger
for
my
phone
is
great
actually
used
it
this
weekend
while
was
camping
did
it
charge
as
fast
as
wall
plug
no
did
it
charge
and
keep
my
going
the
entire
trip
0%
absolutely
cant
say
enough
about
how
impressed
was
with
these
really
wanted
to
like
these
headphones
due
to
the
excellent
noise
canceling
and
the
case
which
acts
as
charging
bank
after
using
them
all
week
at
work
days,
hours,
it
was
apparent
that
these
headphones
would
not
be
something
would
keepthe
biggest
issue
is
the
pain
that
occurs
when
these
are
in
your
ear
for
more
than
about
an
hour
the
headphones
are
kept
in
via
pressure
system
against
the
inside
of
the
ear
and
this
causes
pain
after
awhile
another
issue
is
the
poor
battery
life
could
not
get
more
than
hours
before
got
the
battery
warning
chimethis
brings
me
to
my
0rd
and
final
issue
the
low
battery
warning
chime
at
0%,
you
will
get
this
incessant
"low
battery,
please
charge"
and
several
beeps
until
you
charge
them
could
understand
if
this
was
once
at
0%,
once
at
0%,
once
at
0%,
etc,
but
this
occurs
once
every
seconds,
rendering
them
completely
useless
this
causes
the
battery
life
to
be
effectively
shortened
to
0%
use
when
the
battery
life
is
already
not
stellaroverall,
cannot
recommend
this
product
they
were
returned
once
they
connect
and
are
playing
your
media,
theyre
pretty
solid
the
charging
case
is
nice,
the
fit
of
the
ear
buds
is
good
dont
feel
like
they
are
going
to
fall
out,
for
instance,
and
they
are
fairly
comfortable
my
biggest
complaint
is
pairing/controls
and
range
these
are
my
first
allwireless
bluetooth
earbuds,
so
dont
know
how
standard
these
controls
are
but
when
you
first
turn
on
the
buds
they
default
at
about
0%
volume,
which
is
too
quiet
even
at
full
volume
from
my
phone
adjusting
hardware
volume
require
both
ear
buds
long
press
left
bud
is
volume
down,
long
press
right
bud
is
volume
up
pairing
is
also
an
issue,
it
sometimes
takes
me
few
tries
to
get
the
earbuds
paired
with
my
phone;
sometimes
my
device
will
say
its
paired
with
the
buds
but
the
buds
don't
say
"paired,
left
channel"
or
whatever,
so
try
again
once
paired,
they
work
fine,
except
for
the
fact
that
if
have
my
phone
in
my
pocket
or
even
holding
my
phone
in
my
hand
while
walking,
the
connection
is
weak
and
audio
cuts
in
and
out
have
to
put
my
phone
in
my
chest
pocket
or
hold
it
at
about
chest
height
to
keep
the
audio
uninterrupted
pretty
great
for
the
cost,
but
we
bought
two
pairs
and
both
eventually
gave
out
on
us
one
pair
was
about
five
months
in
and
the
other,
about
the
sound
slowly
went
out
on
one
side
other
thing
is,
the
battery
life
is
incredible,
but
they
do
start
to
malfunction
lot
when
the
battery
starts
to
get
low
the
crummiest
part,
you
don
usually
know
until
you
already
have
them
in
with
intentions
to
use
them
then
suddenly
they
are
having
trouble
connecting
and
staying
connected
or
refusing
to
disconnect
even
on
positive
note
though,
we
used
them
daily
at
the
gym
and
they
are
great
in
comfort
and
style,
they
stayed
put
well
even
during
running
or
intense
workouts
and
were
comfortable
for
extended
wear
in
the
long
run,
pretty
good
for
the
cost,
but
probably
not
going
to
last
you
very
long
please
note
though,
both
myself
and
my
husband
used
these
nearly
every
day
for
solid
six
months,
so
they
were
well
loved
if
you
have
intentioned
of
using
them
less
often,
these
may
be
perfect
for
you
these
headphones
are
fantastic
lately
i've
been
using
them
for
audiobooks
while
walking
they
stay
in
my
ear
without
fearing
they'll
move
if
pick
up
the
pace
to
jog
you
can
pair
these
with
up
to
two
devices
at
once
easy
to
use
keeps
charge
few
days,
charges
quickly
and
easy
to
place
in
your
purse
or
pocket
bought
these
primarily
for
listening
to
music
while
relaxing
or
working
out
at
the
gym
for
both
of
these
purposes,
don't
have
any
complaints
was
happy
with
the
multiple
size
earpieces
to
ensure
proper
fit
they
do
tickle
the
inside
of
my
ear
bit
but
after
few
min
of
wearing
them,
but
forget
all
about
it
had
considered
purchasing
some
other
name
brand
ones
which
were
double
the
price
and
i"m
super
happy
went
with
these
as
they
work
fantastic
and
was
able
to
avoid
spending
too
much
moneyi
like
the
storage
case/charging
station
it
comes
with
hoping
it
will
help
prevent
me
from
losing
the
piecescharging
is
quick
and
easy
and
the
pairing
was
super
quick
to
my
iphone
got
it
earlier
when
the
airpod
style
earbuds
aren't
that
common
the
box
is
pretty
big
compared
to
the
current
trend
got
smaller
box
before
but
the
battery
was
usable
only
for
few
months
it
looks
like
they
put
nicad
battery
into
it
and
the
capacity
degrades
very
fast
this
earbud
lasts
lot
longer
and
the
battery
is
still
going
strong
there
is
usb
socket
too
so
you
can
charge
other
things
in
daisy
chainthe
sound
is
good
just
discovered
that
it
has
mic
too
it
sounds
about
the
same
or
better
than
the
one
on
my
chromebookthe
pairing
is
as
easy
as
any
other,
basically,
they
will
pair
or
connect
once
out
of
the
box
but
if
you
switch
between
stereo
mode
and
two
independent
mono
mode,
there
is
non
obvious
reset
sequence
when
they
are
in
the
box
the
newer
ones
are
easier
they
pair
or
connect
when
you
open
the
cover
just
got
these
today
but
have
to
say
i'm
very
impressed
right
out
of
the
box
set
up
and
pairing
was
breeze,
no
different
then
any
other
blue
tooth
devisethe
touch
pads
take
little
getting
used
to
but
in
time
after
few
uses
i'm
sure
will
master
them
battery
life
is
ok
for
this
type
of
head
set
so
far
i'm
going
on
0/0
hours
with
pure
music
and
still
going
strong
even
as
write
this
ok
for
all
that
says
they
lack
the
bass
well
that
can
be
true
if
they
are
not
installed
in
the
ears
right
tried
all
the
buds
that
came
with
it
and
found
the
medium
to
be
the
best
for
me
but
it
was
still
lacking
bass
so
if
pushed
them
in
my
ears
more
the
bass
would
come
out
but
they
didn't
stay
put
and
were
not
all
that
comfortableso
had
idea
and
put
my
regular
med
cone
shape
buds
on
them
from
spares
have
and
that
did
the
trick
no
more
pushing
in
to
get
bass
so
to
some
it
up
if
you
need
to
push
them
in
your
ears
to
get
more
or
any
bass
try
different
buds
from
other
head
sets
don't
think
the
buds
that
come
with
them
are
the
best
quality
and
don't
seal
all
that
great
that's
why
they
lack
in
bassthese
things
sound
great
now
with
more
then
enough
bassthey
are
little
snugger
fitting
in
the
case
but
found
when
close
the
lid
they
start
to
charge
fine
for
the
money
these
are
great
deal
have
listened
to
air
pods
and
was
never
impressed
with
there
sound
as
am
now
with
thesethe
reviews
0+
don't
lie
most
are
very
positive
i've
been
using
this
product
for
about
weeks
now,
so
feel
like
have
enough
experience
to
comment
on
all
the
pertinent
concerns
in
general,
this
is
solid
product
it
has
it's
pros
and
cons,
as
with
most
productspros
let's
start
with
the
goodthe
price
is
great
what
can
say
$0
for
all
this
is
hard
to
beatthese
fit
really
well
in
my
ears
know
this
can
be
hit
and
miss
for
most
users,
because
ear
shape
matters
but
they
do
come
with
three
sizes
of
rubber
inserts,
so
imagine
most
will
find
these
comfythe
sound
quality
is
pretty
good,
if
not
slightly
underpowered
sometimes
max
volume
is
not
quite
enough
like
when
inside
my
motorcycle
helmet
when
riding,
in
which
case,
using
both
buds
helpsthey
function
independently,
which
for
me
is
essential
my
previous
experience
with
bluetooth
bt
ear
buds
is
with
singles
not
sets,
so
use
these
both
individually
more
often
than
together
in
other
words,
use
the
right
with
left
in
the
charging
cradle
until
it
runs
out
of
battery
power,
then
switch,
and
so
on,
back
and
forth
use
them
together
when
listen
to
music
and
need
the
full
sound
at
the
gym,
hikes,
etcone
of
my
favorite
features
is
the
rechargeable
battery
pack
cradle
as
is
advertised
this
cradle
can
charge
each
bud
at
least
dozen
times,
probably
more
think
the
first
time
out
it
did
or
so
in
six
weeks,
of
relatively
heavy
use
daily,
switching
back
and
forth,
i've
charged
the
cradle
itself
only
once
it
still
has
all
bars
itself
just
carry
the
cradle
with
me
basically
everywhere
go
and
this
always
provides
way
to
charge
the
buds
love
thisi
haven't
used
it
to
charge
phone
or
tablet,
but
probably
will
one
day
although,
have
mah
battery
pack
use
for
thiscons
not
really
bad,
but
less
than
goodthe
pairing
can
be
finicky
this
has
been
mentioned
in
several
other
reviews
have
rather
complex
set
of
bt
requirements,
so
i've
had
to
develop
system
to
keep
this
straight
have
the
following
bt
connections
with
my
phone:
car
audio,
sound
bar,
workstation,
laptop,
jbl
standalone
speaker,
and
tablet
and
should
note
that
other
sources
connect
to
some
of
these
which
makes
it
more
complex
the
way
set
up
the
earbuds
was
to
label
the
left
eb
lp
left
primary
and
the
right
ebr
right
this
makes
it
very
easy
to
use
them
separately,
which
is
my
primary
use
case
whenever
have
problem,
revert
back
to
the
pairing
protocol
in
the
user
manual
this
squares
me
away
most
of
time
also,
when
switching
out
after
battery
is
low,
put
the
used
bud
in
the
cradle
and
wait
0count,
then
remove
the
freshly
charged
one
and
allow
it
to
connectthey
are
kind
of
large
compared
to
other
inear
buds
i've
tried
the
single
ear
buds
tend
to
be
smaller
and
lighter,
so
had
to
get
used
to
bulkier
feel
of
these
all
in
all,
not
that
big
deal,
but
noticeable
can't
wait
for
smaller
set
of
ear
buds
to
come
out,
something
more
sleek
and
light
weightmy
least
favorite
feature
is
the
touch
buttons
on
the
buds
i'm
used
to
physical
button
on
my
previous
several
single
ear
bud
products
mainly
because
i'm
always
accidentally
pressing
it
it's
like
small
touch
screen
just
picking
up
the
bud
and
inserting
into
my
ear
often
starts
playing
and
if
you
have
kids
who
like
to
muck
with
your
ear
buds,
well
i'll
find
my
content
has
been
playing
for
minutes
or
even
hours
sometimes
by
accidental
button
pressesone
thing
used
to
do
all
the
time
is
take
the
bud
out
of
my
ear
when
going
into
coffee
shop
or
store
and
stick
it
in
my
front
shirt
pocket
this
was
not
problem
before,
but
now
often
is
much
prefer
physical
buttonoverall,
this
is
good
almost
great
product
highly
recommend
it
aside
from
few
improvements
mentioned
herein,
would
give
this
stars
maybe
the
next
generation
of
these
ear
buds
will
get
my
love
these
ve
been
using
them
regularly
since
got
them
the
charging
case
still
hasn
died
granted,
probably
don
use
them
as
often
as
most
people
might,
but
it
still
significantthe
sound
quality
is
top
notch,
it
handles
phone
calls
well,
and
the
controls
are
touch
sensitive
so
it
fairly
easy
to
operate
volume,
siri,
and
skipping
without
having
to
pick
up
my
phonethe
downside
is
also
the
touch
sensitivity
firstly
it
takes
some
getting
used
to
handling
these
puppies
without
accidentally
starting/stopping
your
music
or
whatever
else
secondly
these
are
water
proof
to
certain
extent,
but
ve
had
issues
with
the
volume
control
when
the
right
one
gets
wet
it
cranks
the
volume
all
the
way
up
no
damage
to
the
headphones;
just
reacting
to
the
water
as
if
it
was
my
finger
simple
answer
is
don
wear
them
in
wet
environments
first
the
sound
is
great
the
instructions
were
very
easy
to
follow
for
setup
right
out
of
the
box
they
were
able
to
be
used
they
paired
very
easily
with
my
phone
they
fit
great
in
the
ear
and
did
not
fall
out
as
had
experienced
with
other
wireless
earbuds
the
sound
was
great
love
that
the
case
can
be
used
to
charge
your
phone
also
bought
these
for
myself
but
my
year
old
son
tried
them
and
he
actually
said
they
were
better
than
the
pair
he
bought,
which
cost
more
he
said
they
were
great
noise
cancelling
earbuds
think
am
going
to
have
to
buy
him
pair
found
these
headphones
after
wanting
to
try
to
use
completely
wireless
headphones
these
had
good
reviews
for
working
out,
talking
on
the
phone,
and
just
for
music
the
noise
canceling
is
really
great
on
these
but
for
the
price
you
should
ve
just
bought
ear
plugs
because
the
sound
quality
drops
quicklywhen
first
bought
them
the
sound
was
loud
and
vibrant
used
them
at
work
and
for
running
about
hours
day
the
sound
quality
started
dropping
quite
bit
within
the
first
two
weeks
now
can
use
them
for
podcasts
with
the
volume
all
the
way
up
because
if
it
soft
speaker
can
hear
them
the
volume
will
go
in
and
out
and
for
me
it
always
all
the
way
up
when
use
these
headphones
where
as
used
to
be
able
to
keep
it
in
the
low
to
medium
volume
settings
so
stopped
using
it
for
podcasts
then
now
when
accept
call
the
ear
buds
will
freak
out
and
shut
down
completely
if
my
phone
answers
through
themwhat
thought
was
good
deal
is
now
just
two
useless
headphones
that
block
out
noise
so
you
can
use
them
for
hearing
protection
if
you
like
good
pair
of
bluetooth
headphones
sound
quality
better
than
expected
the
instructions
are
descreptive
enough
but
there
is
broken
english
in
use
as
believe
this
is
an
asian
brand
or
something
not
the
best
for
phone
calls
have
to
speak
louder
than
i've
had
to
before
with
other
pairs
of
headphones
but
it's
not
terrible
touch
functionalality
is
good
and
not
overly
sensitive
one
bad
thing
i'll
have
to
note
is
the
headphones
charging
case
isn't
the
most
secure
on
keeping
the
headphones
latched
to
the
charging
port
within
the
case
the
case
itself
is
solid
but
the
charging
port
for
the
headphones
youll
have
to
make
sure
they
are
really
on
there
for
them
to
charge
at
least
in
my
experience
my
first
pair
of
"wireless
ear
buds"
so
maybe
my
expectations
are
unreasonable
but
few
things
found
disappointing
even
though
am
generally
satisfied
with
the
product
i've
usually
use

per

long

the

the

sounds
good,
comfortable
fit,
decent
battery
life,
lots
of

from
fully

case
feels
like
its
not
the
cheapest
thing
china
makes
and
they
even
fit
while
wearing
my
motorcycle
helmetbottom
line,
feel
like
got
my
monies
worth
hopefully
they
will
last,
bought
it
because
it
was
the
cheapest
of
similar
selection
wouldn't
be
adverse
to
buying
it
again
if
it
was
still
most
inexpensive
of
the
bunch
was
skeptical
if
these
earbuds
would
fit
in
my
ears
because
i've
had
other
wired
earbuds
that
were
too
large
for
my
ear
canal
but
was
very
pleased
that
they
fit
great
the
sound
was
great
also
and
they
stayed
connected
when
went
upstairs
to
another
part
of
my
house
didn't
measure
in
feet,
but
was
pleased
with
the
distance
the
charging
case
battery
has
lasted
very
long
time
i've
probably
used
the
earbuds
for
hours
and
put
them
back
each
time
i'm
finished
and
haven't
had
to
recharge
the
case
at
all
actually
compared
them
to
another
pair
of
earbuds
my
father
had,
and
the
sound
is
little
better
on
these
little
less
"bass"
only
one
downside,
which
found
in
my
father's
earbuds
also
if
you
are
connected
to
smart
tv,
the
lag
can
be
annoying
haven't
found
way
to
fix
this
if
you
are
buying
these
to
watch
netflix,
you
may
find
them
frustrating
mainly
got
them
for
podcasts
and
audiobooks,
so
i'm
very
happy
have
been
searching
for
pair
of
wireless
earbuds
for
my
galaxy
note
so
can
listen
to
my
audible
books
at
work
these
are
the
first
ones
have
found
that
fit
my
small
ears
and
are
not
uncomfortable
to
wear
and
that
was
after
returning
the
jabra
sport
ones
had
there
are
sizes
of
ear
tips
which
made
it
very
easy
to
find
ones
that
fit
both
ears
the
main
bluetooth
control
is
in
the
left
ear
and
so
far
haven't
been
able
to
use
only
the
right
one
unless
the
left
is
out
of
the
charging
box,
but
can
do
it
with
the
left
one
leaving
the
right
in
the
box
need
one
ear
to
answer
the
phone
and
hear
the
boss
the
buds
are
sturdy
and
well
made
but
not
heavy
and
fit
nicely
into
my
ear
the
quality
of
sound
is
very
good
haven't
used
them
for
calls,
but
as
have
hands
free
in
my
vehicles,
these
will
mostly
be
used
for
privacy
listening
at
work
the
price
is
great
esp
for
the
product
and
support
rec'd
when
asked
questions
the
videos
on
line
show
ios
steps,
but
was
told
they
would
try
and
get
android
ones
up
since
they
are
bit
different
the
directions
do
give
ones
for
use
with
siri
all
in
all,
unless
you
are
dead
set
on
the
airbuds,
you
might
want
to
give
these
try,
esp
if
you
tend
to
lose
things
the
charging
case
is
sturdy
and
it
comes
with
bag
to
carry
that
in,
along
with
short
cord
sweet
deal

and
another
one
bites
the
dust,
the
second
of
the
same
set
of
earbuds
just
stopped
charging
for
$0
would
expect
them
to
last
bit
longer
than
months
the
other
set
is
still
working,
so
i'm
still
giving
it
stars

the
longevity,
we
really
liked

0:
originally
gave
these
stars,
i'm
now
editing
to
stars
as
the
right
earbud
has
stopped
working
it
just
won't
charge
or
work
at
all
so
it
pretty
much
failed
at
longevity
i'm
still
giving
it

out

the
earbuds
still
work
but,
it's
only
been
few
months
and
it's
no

review
:
bought
pair
of
these
for
my
so
about
month
ago
he
liked
them
so
much,
wanted
to
order
pair
for
myself
ended
up
ordering
different
pair
in
the
same
price
point
because
they
had
wireless
charging
unfortunately,
after
using
them
for
just
bit,
quickly
realized
they
were
not
as
good
as
these
thanks
to
amazon's
fantastic
return
policy,
was
able
to
return
those
and
buy
these
for
myself
toothe
reasons
chose
these
over
the
other
pair
and
others
like
them
:quick
and
good
pairing
can
walk
around
my
entire
condo
and
don't
need
to
carry
my
phone
with
mecontrols
on
the
earbuds
can
change
the
track,
the
volume,
play/pause,
and
even
get
siri,
with
quick
touch
to
the
earbuds
good
sound
i'm
no
audiophile
and
the
bass
is
not
super
deep
but
it
is
well
rounded
sound
and
i'm
very
happy
with
the
clarity
and
sound
quality
if
you're
looking
for
really
deep
bass,
you
probably
won't
love
these
as
much
as
do
they
also
get
pretty
loud
if
you
need
thatfantastic
battery
life
like
still
haven't
charged
them
and
have
used
them
ton
since
got
them
the
fact
that
the
case
can
charge
other
things
through
the
usb
is
plus
but
not
deal
breaker
for
me
now
this
also
adds
bulk
to
the
case,
so
if
this
isn't
deal
breaker
and
you
don't
want
bigger
case,
you
may
not
like
these,
but
if
you
hardly
ever
want
to
charge
them,
these
are
winnereach
earbud
can
be
listened
to
separately
this
was
one
of
the
biggest
things
for
me
can
have
earbud
in
and
the
other
one
charging,
still
use
the
controls,
and
pick
up
the
other
one
and
it
immediately
picks
up
and
yes
each
one
works
like
this
there
is
no
master
and
slave
even
better,
can
pair
to
one
device
and
the
other
to
another
device
and
listen
to
both
at
the
same
timethey
are
comfortable
and
good
sized
they
come
with
different
sizes
of
rubber
for
your
ear,
yes
that
part
is
cheap,
but
it's
silicone
piece
for
your
ear
and
it's
pretty
comfortable
even
laying
down
in
bed,
they
don't
stick
out
of
my
ear
so
can
lay
in
bed
with
themphone
calls
are
fine
the
mic
is
in
the
earbud,
it's
far
from
your
mouth,
so
it's
going
to
sound
like
it's
far
from
your
mouth
didn't
buy
these
for
phone
calls
anyway
and
it
works
as
would
expectnow,
haven't
compared
these
with
apple
or
bose
or
anything
like
that,
but
those
are
completely
different
price
point
anyway
overall,
at
this
price
point
these
are
definitely
star
purchase
otherwise
wouldn't
have
bought
the
second
pair
so
if
you
like
to
listen
to
audio
books
this
set
of
ear
buds
is
for
youthese
wireless
ear
buds
came
in
and
fit
perfectly
as
they
were
delivered
very
impressed
with
the
fit
and
long
term
comfort
of
the
ear
budsthe
sound
well
that
leaves
lot
to
be
desired
wear
these
everyday
for
my
lunch
break
walk
at
first
didn
really
notice
how
poor
the
sound
quality
was
just
assumed
it
was
normal
after
week
or
so
if
use
they
ended
up
not
being
charged
one
day
so
had
to
resort
to
my
free
wired
apple
ear
budslet
just
say
was
instantly
unimpressed
with
the
sound
quality
of
the
wireless
buds
purchased
the
free
and
wired
buds
that
came
with
my
phone
sounded
times
betteri
still
am
using
the
wireless
buds
simply
because
hate
cords
but
will
be
looking
for
an
alternative
pair
in
the
not
too
distant
future
when
these
do
work,
they're
fine
liked
them
quite
bit
they're
comfortable
and
they
pair
with
each
other
and
with
my
phone
very
easily
however,
after
only
four
days
of
light
use,
the
audio
started
cutting
out
whenever
walk
with
them
if
these
were
just
for
using
while
i'm
at
home,
wouldn't
really
mind
these
were
primarily
for
when
i'm
out
and
about
can't
walk
to
the
bus
stop
without
the
audio
cutting
out
every
block
it's
shamei've
reset
them,
hoping
that
would
fix
the
issue,
but
it
hasn't
and
it
isn't
that
they
need
to
charge
the
audio
still
cuts
out
even
if
they've
just
been
charged
have
purchased
numerous
bluetooth
earbuds,
both
wired
and
wireless
the
problem
with
the
wireless
is
most
often
pairing
my
previous
purchases
have
been
in
the
$0$0
range,
so
$0
was
leap
the
sound
quality
is
what
you
should
expect
for
such

incredible
was
asked
to
provide
review
on
these
ear
buds
got
my
first
thought
on
the
product
was
that
they
worked
really
well
better
than
other
brands
have
boughti
love
the
case
acts
as
carrying
case
and
charging
station
for
the
buds
as
well
as

station
for
other
products
the
wireless
earbuds
come
in
nice
portable
case,
which
acts
as
both
carrying
case,
charging
station
for
the
earbuds,
and
its
own
charging
device
for
other
small
electronics•
the
fit
of
the
earbuds
was
great
for
me
the
company
provides
few
different
sizes
as
well
in
the
box
for
others
who
may
need
it•
connectivity:
we
had
no
issues
connecting
the
earbuds
to
my
galaxy
note•
sound
and
call
quality:
was
blown
away
by
the
sound
quality
this
holds
true
for
variety
of
music,
from
top
to
edm
likewise,
the
call

was
crisp
and
perfect
for

love
that
the

acts
as

able

update:
sept
0:i
purchased
these
buds
jun
based
on
the
number
of
star
ratings
as
of
this
date,
little
over
months
the
sound
on
the
right
one
has
become
extremely
low,
to
the
point
don't
even
use
it
anymore,
which
defeats
the
purpose
the
left
one
still
functions
well,
but
without
the
right
one
you
cant
control
the
volume
effectively
since
one
bud
controls
an
increase
in
volume,
and
the
other
controls
decrease
in
volume
i'm
not
sure
how
this
item
received
such
high
ratings,
especially
when
going
back
and
reading
the
low
ratings
and
seeing
the
complaints
are
pretty
much
variants
of
the
same
issues
if
you
really
want
good
pair
of
ear
buds,
spend
the
money
for
good
pair
and
don't
spend
your
money
on
thesei've
deleted
my
initial
star
review
for
one
more
appropriate
of
this
item
so
they
sound
alright,
charge
fast
and
the
charging
pack
lasts
forever
sometimes
but
after
using
them
for
few
months
scraped
these
and
got
some
raycons
the
things
that
fell
short
of
usable
is
that
the
battery
life
is
only
like
hours
max
had
connectivity
issues
where
one
pod
just
stopped
connecting
completely
after
about
months
got
the
rubber
ear
pieces
stuck
in
my
ear
often
as
tried
to
remove
them,
thats
little
heart
pumping
and
annoying,
went
as
far
as
to
superglue
the
rubbers
in
place
even
without
touching
them,
just
walking
around,
they
tend
to
fall
out
of
place
and
they
slipped
out
of
my
ear
or
shifted
to
where
couldn
hear
anything
and
one
really
annoying
thing
is
that
sometimes
ll
put
them
away
in
the
case
to
charge
and
then
next
morning
or
next
time
go
to
use
them
they
re
dead
and
the
charging
pack
is
completely
drained
if
you
don
seat
them
completely
in
the
dock,
and
its
near
impossible
to
tell
sometimes,
it
ll
create
draw
and
kill
the
pods
and
the
pack
lucky
it
only
take
like
minutes
to
charge
the
pods
but
the
case
takes
few
hours
all
in
all
they
re
not
bad
for
the
price
but
they
re
cheap
chinese
ear
buds
spend
little
extra
and
get
good
ones
that
dont
have
these
design
flaws
love
these
earbudsthey
come
in
great
charging/carrying
case
with
battery
built
in,
so
right
off
the
bat
was
able
to
charge
the
actual
buds
completely
up
nice
magnetic
connection
so
the
buds
go
right
in,
plus
fullsize
usb
ports
lets
you
charge
other
devices
toothe
micro
usb
cable
included
is
pretty
short
and
thoughthe
buds
themselves
are
great
and
sit
in
my
ear
comfortably,
plus
come
with
several
different
eartip
sizes
the
rubber
eartips
also
attach
pretty
tight
so
no
worries
about
them
falling

cant

sound
qualitytouch
controls
are
very
intuitive,
and
just
quick
check
over
the
manual
was
all
neededonly
tiny
thing
that
comes
into
mind
as
potential
con
is
that
once
when
there
was
jolt/jerk
from
my
jumping
off
something
high,
the
touch
control
registered
it
as
touch
and
paused
my
music,
but
then
want
able
to
recreate
it
afteroverall
really
like
how
comfortable
and
easy
to
use
these
are
these
are
great
for
listening
to
music
but
maybe
not
so
much
for
calls
what
lovepresentation:
these
are
for
my
mom
but
always
try
on
any
headphones/cameras/etc
myself
when
buying
off
brand
because
many
times
they
don't
work
off
the
box
the
box
is
neat
and
have
good
presentation
when
giving
it
as
giftsilicone
buds:
loved
this
my
mom
is
very
particular
about
things
on
her
easrs
not
too
tight,
not
too
lose
so
am
sure
that
she
will
find
her
size
here
and
there
are
doubles
in
case
she
loses
themsound:
she
will
be
using
this
while
working
out
so
it
is
great
for
musiccharging
case:
thankfully
it
is
magnetic
and
it
is
easy
to
place
the
earbud
in
place
without
having
to
fidget
with
it
lot
did
some
shaking
to
it
and
the
earbuds
stayed
in
place
to
charge
also
it
comes
with
bag
for
the
case,
it
is
plastic
and
can
be
easily
scratched
hope
the

will
keep
the
case

suggestionsprint;
could
not
get
clear
picture,
but
the
print
on
the
earbuds
was
already
coming
off
on
one
of
the
earbuds
not
that
big
of
deal
but
since
am
giving
them
as
gift,
it
made
it
look
cheap
and
usedmicrophone:
not
very
good
had
to
go
back
to
phone/speaker
because
the
person
on
the
other
line
could
not
hear
me
since
bought
these
for
music
is
not
big
deal
for
me,
but
anyone
looking
to
use
this
while
on
phone
call,
would
say
try
another
brandoverall,
am
happy
with
my
earbuds
and
specially
since
they
will
be
gift,
do
think
there
will
be
right
size
ear
bud
for
my
mom**will
update
after
my
mom
has
been
using
it
for
couple
months
listen
to
howard
stern
at
work
i'm
contractor
and
work
around
customers
and
if
you
know
howard
stern's
show
you
know
0%
of
the
time
your
customers
should
not
hear
the
show
you're
listening
to
these
headphones
are
perfect
for
me
one
stern
show
is
hours
long
start
the
day
listening
with
the
right
earbud
while
the
left
stays
in
the
charging
case
almost
exactly
at
by
the
end
of
the
show
is
about
when
the
right
earbud
needs
recharged
so
put
it
back
into
the
case
and
then
put
the
left
earbud
in
and
listen
to
another
episode
which
gets
me
through
an
entire
0hour
workday
the
sound
quality
is
perfect
for
me
they
fit
my
ears
perfect
and
have
not
fallen
out
and
feel
so
much
more
freedom
without
wires
going
around
my
neck
or
to
my
phonei've
also
mowed
my
lawn
while
listening
to
music
with
both
earbuds
in
and
the
stereo
sound
was
excellent
researched
lots
of
earbuds
and
i'm
glad
went
with
these,
in
fact
bought
second
set
for
my
coworker
week
after
my
first
purchase
have
no
regrets
see
they
are
now
on
sale
for
so
go
get
them
now
because
paid
full
price
and
still
felt
like
it
was
an
excellent
deal
these
were
little
uncomfortable
at
first
the
little
rubber
piece
feel
cheap,
but
once
found
the
one
like,
they
have
been
great
the
only
down
side
is
they
don
pair
individually
once
the
left
side
does,
you
re
toast
there
is
not
button
button
they
are
touch
only,
so
hung
up
on
lot
of
people
at
first
but
they
pair
seamlessly
when
first
got
it,
the
case
kept
charge
for
whole
week
before
even
charged
it
once
however,
if
you
use
it
as
phone
charger,
it
toast
overall,
like
them

better

ended
up
being
very
pleasantly
surprised
with
these
headphones
bunch
of
people
close
to
have
the
air
pods
but
as
lose
headphones
so
easily,
didn
want
to
spend
hundreds
of
dollars
on
headphones
the
main
reason
was
looking
at
these
was
because
wanted
wireless
wanted
to
have
one
in
at
work
so
that
when
we
get
super
slow,
can
listen
to
my
music
or
watch
show
and
not
have
anyone
think
ignoring
them
also,
wanted
to
see
if
could
work
out
easily
with
them
in
ve
had
them
now
for
over
month
and
here
the
verdict:visibility:
0/0
as
you
can
see
in
the
picture,
the
ear
bud
is
fully
visible
with
my
hair
up
but
with
my
hair
down,
it
clearly
covers
itexercise:
0/0
haven
had
problem
with
them
falling
out
they
ve
stayed
in
perfectly
fine
and
have
made
working
out
easierbattery:
0/0
so
don
really
remember
how
long
they're
supposed
to
be
charged,
but
in
this
past
month
and
half,
ve
charged
them
once
use
them
every
day
for
multiple
hours
do
only
use
one
at
time
so
that
does
factor
in
to
over
all
battery
life
the
case
is
pretty
bulky
can
exactly
store
it
in
the
tiny
pockets
that
are
typically
found
in
women
clothing,
but
it
fits
well
in
my
purseconnection:
0/0
they
connect
well
one
interesting
thing
ve
found
out
is
that
if
you
have
two
devices
connected
to
your
earphones,
this
can
sometimes
cause
glitch
in
the
system
was
watching
show
on
my
ipad,
unknowing
that
it
was
also
connected
to
my
phone,
and
the
sound
kept
on
skipping
or
going
out
easy
fix:
turned
off
the
bluetooth
on
my
phonesound
quality:
0/0
they
sound
pretty
good
to
me,
although
ve
never
really
invested
in
the
most
amazing
sound
quality
in
the
past
so
that
could
just
be
me
to
me
all
that
matters
is
that
can
hear,
understand,
and
enjoy
my
music
and
shows
so
don
have
extremely
high
expectations
anyway
don
believe
it
has
very
good
bass
qualitytalking
on
the
phone:
0/0
it
pretty
good
most
of
the
time
once
or
twice
the
person
on
the
other
line
couldn
hear
me
the
whole
time
so
had
to
take
out
the
earphone
but
every
time
other
than
those,
it
worked
just
finethe
look
and
feel
of
earphonesi
have
small
ears
so
if
wear
these
earphones
for
longer
periods
of
time
ie
0+
hours
the
earphone
does
start
to
hurt
my
ear
little
maybe
if
you
have
bigger
ears,
it
won
it
not
that
big
of
deal
to
me,
just
thought
it
was
worth
mentioning
they
look
sleek
and
are
comfortable
if
keep
them
in
for
less
than
hours
overall,
great
product
wasn't
sure
how
these
would
compare
to
airpods
and
i'm
already
very
used
to
airpods
but
the
price
for
these
is
much
more
attractivethe
pairing
process
was
simple
and
easy,
simply
pop
them
out
of
the
case
and
go
to
your
bluetooth
menu
and
find
x0
pairing
is
practically
instant
it
does
have
some
of
the
same
commands
for
activating
siri,
pausing
and
advancing
tracks
on
the
iphone
just
like
airpods
have
the
xs
maxafter
trying
out
the
multiple
ear
tip
size
options,
found
one
that
worked
well
for
me
will
say,
these
are
very
nice
for
the
price
you're
paying
the
noise
cancelling
is
so
much
better
than
airpods
i've
always
found
airpods
to
be
seminoise
cancelling
for
me,
but
these
blow
them
awaythe
sound
quality
is
excellent
it
won't
compare
to
0/0$
earbuds,
but
these
aren't
0/0$
earbuds
the
bass
is
nice
and
has
more
oomph
than
my
airpods,
but
it
doesn't
lack
in
the
mid
or
high
rangethe
battery
life
is
nice
and
it
seems
to
give
you
very
nice
range
of
listening
did
get
0hrs
of
listening
so
that
isn't
unrealisticultimately
if
you
want
something
quality,
wireless,
and
modestly
priced,
think
these
are
great
option
as
they
give
airpods
run
for
their
money
in
that
battle,
it
really
depends
on
how
they
fit
for
you
as
everyone
has
different
ear
shapes
was
all
over
the
house
and
out
back
and
my
phone
with
my
music
library
stayed
in
the
same
place
in
the
house
these
earbuds
didn
cancel
out
once
great
range
love
that
they
re
completely
wireless
little
on
the
large
side
but
worth
it
to
skip
the
connecting
wire
sound
quality
is
really
good
noise
cancellation
is
decent
great
pair
of
earbuds
recommend
am
amazed
by
the
sweet
and
considerate
design
of
this
pair
of
beautiful
earphones
which
are
cradled
in
small
sleek
case
and
this
case
is
actually
power
bank
which
can
charge
the
earbuds
anytime
in
your
pocket
can
use
either
of
them
and
charge
the
other
one
you
will
never
worry
about
running
out
of
power
with
the
earphones
the
sound
is
crystal
clear
for
me
or
the
other
one
when
make
call
even
when
driving
or
walking
on
the
noisy
street,
the
sound
is
clear
enough
initially
am
worried
if
it
could
fall
off
my
ear
while
walking
or
jogging,
after
days
of
wearing,
it
turns
out
my
worry
is
not
necessary
and
with
long
wearing,
don't
feel
any
discomfort
this
gadget
is
also
easy
to
operate
they
are
always
auto
paired
and
auto
connected
when
you
wear
them
all
you
need
to
do
is
to
click
on
its
surface
for
turning
it
on/off,
taking
call,
or
move
to
next
song
and
so
on
really
like
it
works
pretty
good,
but
the
sound
cuts
out
under
some
circumstances,
like
when
i'm
walking
down
the
street
and
especially
when
i'm
walking
through
the
train
station
when
i'm
on
the
train
or
in
the
gym,
it
seems
to
work
pretty
goodupdate:
0/0/0i've
demoted
my
review
because
of
additional
problems
that
have
popped
up
first,
pairing
to
my
phone
while
docked
in
the
charger
couldn't
understand
why
was
losing
the
sound
on
videos
tried
playing
on
my
phone
only
to
discover
that
the
stupid
earbuds
kept
pairing
with
my
phone
while
they
were
charging
would
tap
my
phone
to
disconnect
but
it
would
repeatedly
pair
up
again
until
had
to
turn
off
the
bluetooth
on
my
phonesecond,
the
earbuds
wouldn't
charge
when
docked
in
the
charging
station
which
is
probably
why
they
kept
pairing
with
my
phone
since
they
thought
they
were
undocked
would
take
them
out,
put
them
back
in,
try
cleaning
the
contacts,
push
them
down
in
the
charging
station,
but
they
wouldn't
recharge
never
know
from
one
day
to
the
next
if
they
will
be
properly
charged
or
disconnect
from
my
phone
when
they're
docked
sometimes
they
do,
but
often
they
don't

after
using
for
another
day
or
two
the
right
ear
bud
is
starting
to
inconsistently
worki
bought
these
ear
buds
to
use
at
my
job,
like
many
people
today
work
in
an
open
office
setting
so
need
to
be
able
to
focus
despite
there
being
constant
chatter
and
potential
interruptionsso
far
these
ear
buds
are
working
well,
they
don't
do
great
job
at
pure
noise
cancellation
but
all
you
have
to
do
is
turn
up
the
volume
bit
it
was
easy
to
get
them
paired,
and
while
i've
had
few
issues
here
and
there
around
one
ear
bud
pairing
and
the
other
not,
nothing
has
been
persistent
or
outside
of
the
normal
fussiness
find
with
all
bluetooth
products
you
can
tap
the
side
of
them
to
pause
the
music
if
you
do
need
to
stop
and
engage
in
conversationbattery
life
seems
great,
and
the
fact
that
you
get
charging
case
included
in
the
0$
price
point
is
very
nice
the
quality
of
the
ear
buds
themselves
seems
on
the
lower
end
the
feel
of
the
plastic
and
rubber
parts
for
example
is
not
premium
but
it
is
serviceable
sound
quality
is
also
good,
not
great
of
course
but
at
this
price
point
would
certainly
say
it
is
better
than
expectedall
and
all,
don't
think
you
can
wrong
with
these
as
an
entry
point
to
having
wireless
ear
buds
read
lot
of
reviews
here
and
looked
up
youtube
reviews
upon
purchasing
these
was
decently
impressed
let
me
address
some
of
the
things
found
while
reading
reviews0
no
bass
this
actually
was
less
of
an
issue
than
thought
appreciate
good
bass
when
working
out
and
was
worried
these
wouldn't
deliver
maybe
it's
because
my
expectations
were
low
but
overall
these
handle
bass
decently
well0
weird
tip
covers
these
buds
have
long
"shaft"
the
part
that
goes
into
your
ear
canal
is
long,
it
goes
deeper
into
your
ear
than
normal
earbuds
do
therefore,
the
tips
have
to
be
shallower
than
other
earbuds
this
can
be
irritable
and
takes
some
getting
used
to0
pairing
and
connectivity
did
find
these
to
cut
out
occasionally
not
enough
to
have
to
repair
or
reboot
the
headphones
honestly,
didn't
mind
it
too
much
it
probably
cut
out
about
times
during
my
hr
workoutpros
and
conspros:0
turning
them
on
and
off
as
well
as
the
pairing
is
super
easy
this
functionality,
i'd
say,
is
just
as
good
as
something
like
the
powerbeats
pro
or
earpods
pull
them
out
of
the
case
they
turn
on
and
autoconnect
to
my
device
put
them
back
into
the
case
and
they
turn
off0
lightweight
and
balanced
they
didn't
fall
out
of
my
ears0
the
sound
quality
was
much
better
than
expected
again,
maybe
had
low
expectations
but
they
sounded
great
because
they
go
deep
in
your
ear
you
also
have
almost
no
outside
sound
coming
through,
which
is
huge
plus
for
mecons:0
because
they
go
deep
into
your
ear
they
can
be
uncomfortable
at
times
realized
that
the
more
used
them
the
more
my
ears
got
used
to
them
but,
they
are
uncomfortable
to
begin
with0
the
case
is
bulky
in
fact,
left
the
case
in
my
car
before
entering
the
gymoverall,
you
get
what
you
pay
for
and
little
more
with
these
headphones
don't
expect
the
world,
but
for
budget
pair,
they're
not
bad
this
is
the
third
wireless
set
that
purchased
and
the
first
am
happy
withi
first
got
the
tribit
x0
true
wireless
earbuds
which
liked
but
the
sound
in
one
of
them
would
go
out
randomly
it
was
very
annoying
but
manageable
stopped
using
them
when
my
dog
ate
themthe
second
pair
got
was
the
bokai
nobby
wireless
earbuds
again,
the
sound
was
good
when
it
worked
but
it
would
lose
reception
almost
like
radio
signal
getting
fuzzy
this
was
more
annoying
than
no
sound
at
all
and
my
least
favorite
of
the
threethese
ones
have
different
pad
choices
to
fit
your
ears
are
comfortable
and
sound
good
charge
every
night
so
can't
attest
to
battery
life
but
it
does
get
me
through
my
workouti
do
also
use
apple
airbuds
for
my
work
iphone
and
would
say
these
are
comparable
to
them
update:
ended
up
returning
these,
due
to
exactly
the
reason
many
people
didn't
like
them:
if
your
phone
is
in
your
pocket
and
you're
walking,
the
connection
cuts
in
and
out
thought
it
might
not
bother
me
but
it
was
vertigo
inducing
i'm
saving
my
money
for
namebrand
version
that
has
proven
themselvesi
read
the
reviews
and
realize
some
people
didn't
love
these
don't
love
them
either,
but
it
depends
on
how
much
you
want
to
spend
as
it
is,
i'm
on
the
fence
if
i'll
still
keep
them
the
sound
quality
is
not
bad,
except
that
every
few
minutes,
it
sounds
like
record
scratching
and
every
other
few
minutes,
the
right
earbud
disconnects
and
reconnectsthe
fit
is
fairly
uncomfortable
to
me
don't
like
the
rubber
flanges
and
my
ear
canals
are
fairly
large
the
instructions
in
the
package
are
not
sufficient
to
understand
how
to
run
the
touch
controls
either
that,
or
the
volume
is
not
actually
controlled
from
the
touch
controls
finally,
understood
that
the
charger
would
work
with
my
qi
pad,
but
it
does
not
that
was
one
of
the
biggest
reasons
purchased
these
over
another
brand
wouldn't
buy
them
again
great
earphones
and
worth
the
price
very
light
weight
and
produces
incredible
sound
quality
with
crystal
crisp
treble
both
the
earplugs
pair
with
each
other
the
moment
they
are
out
from
the
charging
box
in
matter
of
seconds
it
gets
connected
with
the
phone
android
or
ios
and
you
are
good
to
go
great
addition
to
the
gym
buddies
out
there
who
love
music
on
the
go
goes
on
and
on
for
hours
together
and
also
the
charging
box
charges
these
very
quickly
best
part
you
can
charge
your
phone
from
usb
port
included
in
the
package
too
if
the
are
out
of
battery
while
you
still
enjoy
the
music
while
the
earplugs
are
oncomes
with
multiple
earbuds
in
different
sizes
this
is
perfect
for
running,
jogging,
exercises,
gym,
fitness,
travelling
and
stays
fit
with
the
earsdoes
not
come
off
easily
because
of
the
ergonomic
design
all
in
all
these
are
great
earphones
and
should
be
surely
part
of
your
daily
workout
bought
these
wireless
earbuds
for
mainly
gym
use
cardio
read
some
reviews,
some
very
good,
others
complaining
the
right
ear
bud
stopped
working
bought
these
may
and
it's
now
october
and
the
right
one
has
failed
me
when
you
put
the
buds
in
your
ear,
it
tells
you
that
it
is
pairing
and
connected
the
right
ear
bud
says
connected,
yet
music
only
plays
on
the
left
when
they
were
both
working,
sound
quality
was
good,
noise
cancellation
was
excellent,
it
drowned
out
background
noise
from
other
gym
equipment,
and
only
had
to
charge
the
charging
case
once
every
few
weeks
went
to
the
gym
every
other
day
for
min
but
now
the
right
ear
doesn't
work
and
so
bought
airpods
instead
first
of
all
have
smal
ear
canals
and
it
is
very
difficult
to
find
earbuds
that
fit
without
causing
painthese
come
with
different
bud
sizes
the
second
to
the
smallest
fit
me
perfectly
the
sound
is
pretty
darn
good
for
earbudsthey
stay
surprisingly
well
to
test
this
theory
put
them
in
the
ears
of
my
seven
year
old
and
had
her
do
her
thing
she
is
crazy
active
they
did
not
fall
out
in
over
an
hour
of
use
in
fact
she
fussed
at
me
when
took
them
backthey
pair
very
quickly
and
love
that
don
have
to
turn
anything
on
and
off
have
not
used
the
charging
base
for
my
phone
but
have
used
it
quite
bit
to
charge
the
earbuds
the
lighting
system
for
charging
is
easy
to
see
and
readthe
longest
have
used
them
for
has
been
about
hours
straight
they
still
had
plenty
of
battery
life
love
that
the
charging
case
is
small
and
compact
fits
in
my
pocket
easily
haven't
used
these
enough
yet
to
rate
the
battery
life
the
buds
fit
well
in
the
ear,
they
pair
to
themselves
&
my
phone
super
easily
it
is
important
to
make
sure
you
use
the
correct
sized
ear
pieces,
makes
big
difference
in
sound
quality
as
others
have
said,
there
really
isn't
any
base
to
them
but
the
sound
quality
is
clear
&
for
the
money
they
seem
like
good
ear
buds
it
is
also
nice
to
be
able
to
use
the
charging
case
to
charge
other
devices
you
can
check
battery
life
for
the
charging
station
by
pressing
button
on
the
side,
blue
dots
show
up
for
battery
left
to
see
how
much
use
for
the
ear
buds,
when
pair
them
to
your
device
it
shows
percent
left
have
used
these
for
while
now
&
when
vacuum
it's
minutes
to
an
hour,
they
were
down
0%
the
battery
charger
lasts
long
time0/0/0
update:
the
right
ear
bud
has
stopped
taking
charge
&
syncing
to
the
left,
they
now
useless
the
holiday
season
is
here,
so
didn't
expect
such
quick
delivery
my
package
was
delivered
day
early
i'm
so
impressed
with
the
quality
and
the
ease
of
setting
the
earbuds
up
followed
the
easy
to
read
and
understand
instructions
the
sound
quality
is
just
unbelievable
had
been
looking
and
comparing
these
wireless
bluetooth
earbuds
with
other
name
brands
i'm
that
person
that
reads
the
reviews
and
will
compare
for
days,
weeks
or
months
before
buying
there
were
lot
of
good
reviews
on
this
item
i'm
so
glad
that
choose
this
brand
they
are
very
comfortable,
and
the
sound
is
incredible
can't
say
enough
about
these
i'm
so
impressed
that
will
be
buying
another
pairs
for
christmas
gifts
for
both
of
my
children
rarely
leave
reviews
unless
am
blown
away
by
product,
either
negatively
or
positively
unfortunately,
these
earbuds
fall
into
the
negative
category
like
other
reviewers
have
pointed
out,
the
sound
quality
is
great
for
the
price
the
buds
don't
seem
to
have
active
noise
cancellation,
but
if
you
take
the
time
to
test
the
different
rubber
tips
you
should
be
able
to
find
good
fit
which
makes
them
decently
comfortable
for
few
hours
and
adds
to
the
audio
and
"noise
canceling"
experience
was
extremely
excited
to
find
that
pairing
was
quick
and
easy
with
my
iphone
0+
and
after
attaching
the
correct
rubber
tips
was
very
impressed
with
the
sound
quality
walked
around
my
residential
neighborhood
and
was
sure
that
had
found
suitable
replacement
for
when
did
not
want
to
carry
my
bose
oe
bluetooth
headset
around
no,
they
don't
sound
as
good
as
the
bose
but
better
than
airpods
mostly
due
to
the
rubber
sealhowever,
walking
around
my
immediate
neighborhood
or
inhome
use
are
really
all
these
are
good
for
now
the
reason
for
my
poor
review
is
because
these
earbuds
are
extremely
prone
to
interference
which
is
common
for
this
style
attempted
to
use
them
the
next
day
around
my
office
in
queens,
ny
which
is
where
the
disappointment
set
in;
simply
walking
down
busy
street
caused
the
right
earbud
to
lose
signal
followed
the
online
directions
to
reset
and
repair
the
buds
something
that
many
reviewers
and
the
manufacturer
claimed
would
help,
but
no
luck
hoped
that
it
might
just
be
an
issue
near
my
office
as
my
cellular
has
difficulty
with
reception
there
as
well,
so
tested
in
manhattan,
ny
and
they
barely
functioned
at
all
standing
in
busy
nyc
intersection
caused
both
earbuds
to
lose
connectivity
to
my
phone,
something
that
never
happens
with
my
bose
oe
they
are
so
unusable
in
the
areas
where
would
want
to
use
them
most
that
requested
return
from
amazon,
though
was
super
busy
and
failed
to
send
them
back
in
time
i'm
now
out
$0
which
is
mostly
my
fault,
though
they
are
clearly
under
powered
when
it
comes
to
pairing
still
prefer
to
use
my
bose
headset
at
home
and
would
never
recommend
these
to
anyone
intending
to
use
these
earbuds
in
semipopulated
urban
/
city
arealastly:
taking
call
is
fine
indoors,
but
these
are
not
usable
in
noisy
or
windy
environments
for
phone
conversations
i've
had
friends
threaten
to
kill
me
if
ever
called
them
second
time
while
using
these
outdoors
lol
i've
had
these
for
about
weeks
and
i'm
loving
them
bought
them
because
read
reviews
that
you
could
use
them
individually
right
while
left
is
in
the
case
and
left
while
right
is
in
the
case
read
another
person's
review
and
instructions
on
how
to
do
this
with
no
avail
tried
like
times
totally
gave
up
on
the
dream
that
i'd
ever
have
them
&
and
left
the
ear
bud
named
x0l
one
day
pulled
out
the
right
one
and
put
it
in
my
ear
and
in
the
time
it
took
me
to
do
that
and
reach
for
the
r,
my
bluetooth
found
new
x0
was
so
excited
immediately
connected
it
and
renamed
it
x0r
could
probably
never
do
it
again
but
it
happened
and
i'm
grateful
it
did
if
you
dont
have
success
following
the
other
reviewer's
instructions,
maybe
try
my
method
of
leaving
the
left
one
named
x0l
and
one
day
just
pull
of
the
right
one
and
let
the
bluetooth
on
your
phone
find
it
randomly
if
you're
still
reading
this,
i'm
sorry
for
being
so
wordy
hope
you
enjoy
these
as
much
as
do
got
these
as
birthday
present
as
they
were
very
highly
recommended
by
other
reviewers,
however
felt
that
they
fell
short
of
expectations
what
liked
about
them
the
most
was
probably
the
battery
life
and
charge
time
everything
else
seemed
like
compromisefit:
the
quality
of
the
ear
inserts
felt
cheap,
and
didn't
do
much
to
keep
them
securely
in
my
ears
there
were
multiple
occasions
where
an
ear
bud
fell
out
of
my
ear,
once
nearly
landing
in
my
coffee
at
my
desk
quickly
moved
my
cup,
and
instead
spilt
coffee
all
over
my
new
notepadconnectivity:
these
earbuds
were
supposed
to
be
able
to
connect
to
multiple
devices,
but
never
easily
to
the
one
wanted
was
playing
muscle
chairs
with
them
across
devices
constantly
cycling
on
and
off
the
bluetooth
connections
this
becomes
tedious
after
short
whilesound
quality:this
was
real
issue
for
me
partially
because
could
never
get
these
to
sound
balanced
between
the
earbuds
on
always
seemed
louder
than
the
other,
and
sometimes
it
switched
ears
as
to
which
would
be
louder
than
the
other
there
was
no
consistency,
even
after
switching
out
the
tips
for
the
ears
they
seemed
clear
for
talking,
since
nobody
ever
complained
about
not
being
able
to
hear
me,
but
the
bass
output
was
really
lackingipx0:this
was
actually
one
of
the
better
selling
features
that
held
up
its
end
of
the
bargain
was
rather
satisfied
with
the
water
resistance
after
multiple
workouts,
they
still
maintained
their
resistancei
tried
these
out
for
almost
full
month
before
throwing
in
the
towel
on
them
wanted
to
like
them
and
prove
the
reviews
right,
but
they
never
performed
that
great
too
bad
have
used
powerbeats
failed
after
month,
samsung
galaxy
ear
buds,
bose,
and
numerous
other
wireless
and
true
wireless
earbuds
for
when
am
at
the
gym
these
are
better
than
most
sound
quality
is
little
less
than
bose,
about
the
same
as
the
powerbeats,
and
better
than
others
however
sit
in
sauna
for
min
before
and
after
my
workouts
not
mention
sweat
like
prostitute
at
confession
while
working
out
and
these
make
it
through
that
without
overheating
every
single
time
this
is
my
second
pair
as
the
first
one
started
to
have
little
"glitch"
in
the
right
ear
bud
after
year
and
half
of
constant
abuse
so
for
bucks
got
another
pair
cheap,
reliable,
and
good
sound
quality
not
near
the
bose
sound
but
hell
again
they're
bucks
highly
recommend
am
not
an
audiophile
by
any
means,
but
was
absolutely
impressed
with
the
sound
of
these
headphones
use
these
with
my
galaxy
s0+
i've
had
some
difficulty
with
other
headphones
with
my
galaxy
phones,
however
these
have
been
seamless
spent
lot
of
time
reading
reviews
on
many
different
headsets
and
many
having
very
wimpy
bass
was
actually
very
pleased
with
the
bass
level
the
only
very
minor
short
coming
is
ideally
bit
larger
size
ear
inserts
to
feel
little
more
snug
in
my
ear
they
come
with
sets
of
small,
medium
and
largei
just
wish
there
was
an
xl
insert
and
these
things
would
be
absolutely
perfect
and
for
the
price
you
can't
beat
them
in
my
opinion
acceptable
headphones,
nothing
to
write
home
about
battery
life
is
abysmal
the
case
was
piece
of
trash
and
when
driving
in
my
car
with
my
car
hooked
up
to
the
car
stereo,
it
would
allow
the
earpiece
to
loosen
up
inside
of
it
and
reconnect
to
it,
stopping
playback
thru
car
stereo
would
have
to
manual
forget
device
every
time
got
in
my
car
and
that
got
really
real
old,
really
really
fast
the
company
is
disgusting
however
after
less
than
year,
one
side
stopped
working
reached
out
and
they
told
me
to
clean
the
earwax
and
get
back
to
them
responded
that
they
weren
dirty
but
cleaned
them,
and
never
heard
back
from
them
reached
back
out
and
nothing
no
customer
support,
no
regard
for
consumer
satisfaction
garbage
product
and
garbage
company
first
the
good:
the
case
makes
storage
and
charging
very
convenient
can
see
the
appealsound
quality
is
okay,
though
i've
heard
better
from
cheaper
headphones
the
rubber
ear
pieces
are
all
on
the
small
side,
so
even
with
the
largest
it
doesn't
make
good
seal
they
aren't
at
risk
of
falling
out
unless
you
accidentally
brush
them,
but
it's
hard
to
hear
what's
playing
in
noisy
environment
also
tapping
them
acts
as
button
for
google
assistant,
so
if
you
try
to
adjust
them
it
will
stop
what
you
are
playing
there
may
be
way
to
disable
this,
but
it's
an
annoying
defaultnot
flaw,
but
matter
of
preference,
but
i've
realized
prefer
the
type
of
bt
headphones
which
are
connected
with
wire
since
it's
one
less
piece
to
fuss
with,
and
if
one
ear
falls
out
it
won't
land
on
the
grownfinally
they
stopped
playing
any
sound
after
just
few
months
though
still
get
the
auto
connection
notification
would
return
them,
but
it's
not
worth
the
hassle
buy
cheap
earbuds
on
sale
because
lose
them
constantly
these
are
pretty
good,
but
not
as
good
as
the
neo
liberty
that
splurged
on
but
better
than
the
other
cheap
ones
they
arrived
fully
charged,
and
there
is
actually
usb
port
to
plug
something
else
in
that
needs
quick
charge,
in
my
case
probably
another
set
of
lost
earbuds
that
have
just
found
one
thing
i'd
like
to
say
is
that
it
was
not
easy
to
figure
out
how
to
open
the
case
to
get
the
earbuds
out
that
me
about
minutes
i'm
not
sure
if
it
was
my
nurseheimer's
or
there
really
is
usability
issue
at
any
rate,
now
know
how
to
do
it,
and
these
earbuds
are
good
enough
for
someone
like
me
who
can't
keep
track
of
her
earbuds
this
newer
version
is
ridiculously
awesomemy
husband
and
each
have
the
previous
version
and
we
love
them
with
the
previous
version,
you
had
the
ability
to
listen
to
one
earbud
at
time,
thereby
continuously
listening
without
waiting
for
charging
all
you
had
to
do
was
pair
the
side
you
had
switched
to
this
new
version
doesn't
even
require
the
pairing
you
can
pull
out
the
charged
side
and
it's
already
paired
and
playing
the
previous
version
had
an
issue
with
microphone
quality
on
calls,
but
people
are
telling
me
sound
really
good
on
this
new
version
my
husband
will
be
getting
pair
of
these
now,
and
we
will
use
the
older
version
as
backup
my
previous
headphones
had
to
go
down
the
drain
due
to
connection
failure
because
they
were
wireless
still
had
cable
that
connected
them
was
curious
to
checkout
some
"true
wireless"
headphones
after
reading
up
on
them
bit,
decided
to
purchase
these
took
me
some
time
to
figure
out
how
to
use
them,
because
didn't
remove
the
little
plastic
strips
that
covered
the
charging
port
parts
once
removed
those
read
the
instructions
:d,
they
charged
immediately
and
very
fast
and
the
battery
life
is
amazing
can
go
to
the
gym
for
days
and
get
to
hour
workouts
in
and
it's
no
problem
love
how
they
fit
in
my
ear
and
completely
drown
out
any
other
sound
gets
me
0%
focused
and
in
the
zone
they
are
feather
light,
so
if
only
wear
one
keep
the
other
one
in
the
box
so
don't
loose
it
or
crush
it
by
accident
the
sound
quality
is
flawless
the
base
sounds
great,
especially
when
you
turn
it
up
quite
bit
my
personal
experience
has
been
nothing
but
great
with
talking
don't
know
if
one
works
better
than
the
other,
but
always
use
the
one
in
my
left
ear
and
was
able
to
talk
without
problem
on
dog
walk
for
good
min
have
yet
to
test
them
out
in
water,
gonna
try
light
swim
and
shower
soonthe
charging
base
feels
great
as
well,
it
has
weight
to
it
and
the
magnetism
in
the
box
for
the
buds
make
it
super
convenient
to
throw
em
back
in
thereas
for
the
fit,
did
everything
with
them:
normal
power
lifting,
back
flips,
crossfit,
hiit,
jump
rope,
you
name
itthey
don't
movei
have
had
several
people
approach
me
about
them
and
strongly
recommended
them
to
all,
resulting
in
of
them
buying
their
own
pair,
and
got
some
my
wife
recently
pasonomi,
want
to
talk
about
an

best
headphones
i've
ever
owned
get
yourself
pair
:
i've
been
looking
for
wireless
earbuds
for
few
months
now,
and
after
reading
so
many
different
reviews
of
many
different
products,
settled
on
these
primarily
these
were
within
my
budget
and
seemed
to
have
all
of
the
features
was
looking
forthe
packaging
overall
is
excellent;
reminds
me
of
how
apple
packs
their
products
the
box
easily
slides
out
using
small
strap,
to
expose
the
products
everything
was
packed
very
well,
making
it
really
simple
to
unbox
and
setupwhat's
in
the
box
wireless
earbuds
small
carry
case
for
the
earbuds
which
also
keeps
them
charged
when
not
using
plenty
of
extra
rubber
ear
caps
charging
cable
carry
pouchoverall,
i'm
extremely
impressed
with
what
received
the
travel
charging
case
is
really
nice
touch
i'd
expect
the
buds
to
cost
more
than
the
price
they
sell
forread
the
instructions,
and
pairing
was
sinch
was
able
to
unbox
and
actually
start
using
the
earbuds
in
less
than
minutes
time
for
the
price,
i'm
rather
impressed
with
the
overall
sound
quality
the
audio
is
definitely
crystal
clear,
sharp,
and
filling
you
will
not
find
better
earbuds
at
this
pricebattery
life
so
far
has
been
excellent
the
longest
i've
used
them
is
about
0/0
hours
and
they
still
performed
wellif
you're
looking
for
quality
earbuds
that
feature
premium
quality
design
and
sound,
you
won't
be
disappointed
with
these
highly
recommened
was
pleasantly
surprised
at
how
these
headphones
fit
into
your
ear
i've
never
really
been
huge
earbud
fan,
but
these
fit
much
better
than
typical
earbud
they
actual
part
that
sits
into
your
ear
fits
nicely,
and
the
actual
speaker
is
small
enough
that
it
sits
comfortably
without
blocking
your
ear
canalthe
sound
quality
is
good
for
the
size
of
the
speaker
too
the
bass
isn't
crazy
deep,
but
that's
to
be
expected
from
this
style
of
headphonethe
only
issue
had
was
that
had
difficult
time
pairing
them
to
my
phone,
but
that's
because
misunderstood
the
instructions
to
pair
it,
you
initially
pull
the
tabs
off
the
earpieces,
put
them
back
into
the
case,
and
then
pull
them
out
again
to
pair
them
once
you
pull
them
out
of
the
case,
then
you
can
pair
it
to
your
phone
was
attempting
to
leave
them
in
the
case
and
trying
to
pair
that
was
the
only
hiccup
had
with
them,
but
now
they're
awesome
update
they
went
bad,
one
ear
would
be
static
contacted
amazon
for
help
and
they
pawned
me
off
to
the
company
they
did
zero
for
me
once
again
the
big
shaft
when
it
comes
to
warrant
can
see
if
it
over
the
year
buts
not
even
year
yet
come
on
amazon
take
care
of
your
customers
get
rid
of
the
bad
vendorsthis
sound
is
ok,
they
are
very
small
and
fit
in
my
ear
very
comfortably
the
issue
is
battery
life
you
get
three
hours
and
that
about
it
it
good
for
laying
in
bed
at
night
listening
to
music
or
watching
movie
however
if
you
think
you
re
going
to
use
it
all
day
at
work
no
way
you
have
to
recharge
it
every
three
hours
other
than
that
really
like
them
and
the
price
was
really
good
to
these
are
too
sensitive
to
touch,
if
you
re
on
call
and
barely
tap
the
ear
bud,
including
accidentally
bumping
your
ear
or
adjust
fit,
it
will
end
the
call
if
listening
to
music
same
issue
have
small
ears
so
this
may
not
be
an
issue
for
all,
but
they
slowly
slip
out
of
place
so
have
to
adjust
them
often
have
to
keep
phone
near
by
if
you
want
to
answer
calls
or
go
to
next
song
they
don
have
automatic
shut
off,
standby
or
sleep
mode
to
preserve
battery
life,
the
charging
case
being
able
to
act
as
emergency
charger
for
you
cell
phone
is
really
the
only
plus
side
to
these
if
you
want
bluetooth
headphone
suggest
the
wired
ones
with
the
toggle
switch
which
allows
you
to
control
volume,
answering
callers,
music
have
only
used
the
earbuds
for
listening
to
music
and
have
not
tried
the
phone
option
the
price
was
right
on
these
earbuds
and
the
overall
size
is
small
compared
to
other
wireless
earbuds
they
do
not
stick
far
out
from
your
ear
have
cords/batteries
that
go
around
your
neck
or
look
like
weird
earrings
like
the
airpods
they
fit
comfortably
and
stay
in
your
ear
when
running
battery
life
seems
to
be
around
hours
depending
on
volume,
they
connect/pair
easily
with
my
iphone

well
as

they
just
lack
any

have
had
these

for
few
weeks
now
have
used
them
just
about
every
other

and
have
yet
to
recharge
the
case
use
them
mostly
on
my
commute
to
and
from
work
they
are
on
anywhere
during
that
time
for
minutes
and
have
yet
to
use
these
on
an
occasion
where
they
run
out
of
power
have
used
them
for
around
hours
max,
at
one
time,
while
exercising
on
treadmill
while
paired
with
tablet
am
confident
they
could
have
gone
longer
without
charging
them
up
as
with
any
device,
there
are
some
really
good
things,
some
good
things
and
some
things

not

there
are
plenty
of
ear
tips
to
find
one
that
fits
your

canal0
pairing
the
buds
to
my
s0
was
breeze
and
they
are
quick
to
connect
pairing
them
to
my
tablet
was
likewise
simpleon
to
the
things
didn't
care
much
for0
these
buds
did
take
few
days
for
my
ears
to
get
to
use
to
had
pair
of
noot
wired
headphones
before
which
were
tiny
the
pasonomi
buds
fit
easily
into
my
ear
canal,
however
there
was
little
discomfort
in
the
beginning
regarding
how
the
buds
sit
on
my
outer
ear
after
few
days
though,
it
is
fine
have
even
dozed
off
with
them
in
my
ears
while
riding
the
train
home
this
may
be
just
problem
for
me
though0
the
sound
quality
of
the
earbuds
is
good,
but
not
great
where
lows
and
bass
are
concerned
think
the
noot
headphones
have
little
bit
better
bass,
but
otherwise
the
quality
is
similar
and
they
are
better
than
the
wired
buds
that
came
with
my
s0
for
the
cost,
these
wireless
buds
are
good
regarding
sound
think
they
are
clear
and
the
highs
are
good,
but
if
your
looking
for
deep
bass
tones
and
better
lows,
you
may
want
to
look
deeper
into
reviews
of
this
and
other
sets
that
are
higher
priced
am
in
no
way
disappointed
with
my
purchase
and
love
these
buds0
the
touch
sensitivity
of
the
control
for
the
buds
is
interesting
and
think
just
need
to
get
more
used
to
it
have
tried
to
adjust
the
buds
and
inadvertently
stopped
or
skipped
song
was
one
am
better
than
once
was,
and
maybe
just
need
little
more
practiceall
in
all,
think
this
was
great
purchase
and
value
these
buds
as
more
than
just
device
for
listening
to
music
the
case
maybe
be
bulkier
and
heavier
than
the
competition,
but
the
ability
to
hold
charge
for
such
long
period
of
time,
and
power
other
devices
far
outweighs
anything
negative
for
me
that
people
have
said
about
the
case
would
definitely
purchase
these
again
and
recommend
them
to
anyone
looking
for
bluetooth
headset
and
was
not
as
concerned
about
perceived
lack
of
bass
for
such
small
device
really
love
the
headphones
they
are
great
they
come
with
extra
buds
for
your
ears

product
highly
recommend
wow,
i'm
literally
shocked
at
how
good
these
are
thought
it
was
going
to
be
cheap
earphones
but
they're
pretty
high
quality
and
the
sound
it's
great
it
does
cancel
out
ambient
noise
sometimes
cant
here
my
boss
yelling
at
me
it's
great
as
for
working
out
these
are
pretty
good
but
doing
anything
too
fast
might
knock
it
out
it's
only
happened
to
me
once
doing
frontflip
these
are
great
little
earbuds,
but
see
lot
of
reviews
here
indicating
that
you
can
use
these
fully
with
two
devices
device
pairing
that
is
not,
in
fact,
the
case
let
me
be
specific
so
if
anyone
is
buying
these
you
know
what
you
are
getting
true
multiple
device
headsets/earphones/buds
will
be
able
to
pair
with
two
devices
seamlessly
what
mean
is,
if
you
have
phone,
you
can
pair
the
buds
with
the
phone
no
trouble
then
if
you
have
kindle,
for
example,
you
can
also
pair
the
buds
with
the
kindle
if
you
go
to
work
out,
you
can
be
watching
your
kindle
and
hearing
full
sound
through
both
earbuds
as
you
would
expect
if
you
then
get
call
on
your
phone,
you
will
be
able
to
simply
pause
the
kindle
or
it
will
pause
for
you,
you
can
immediately
take
the
call
and
at
the
end,
simply
restart
the
movie
on
your
kindle
that
is
full
multiple
device
pairing
and
these
earbuds
do
not
have
this
feature
instead,
what
you
can
do
is
pair
one
bud
with
your
kindle,
walk
few
yards
away
and
pair
the
other
bud
with
your
phone
you
can
then
watch
movie
on
one
earbud,
and
if
call
comes
in,
take
that
call
on
the
other
bud,
ie
no
full
pairing
it's
annoying
and
frankly,
only
something
you
would
put
up
with
if
you
didn't
know
that
full
pairing
existedapart
from
that
the
buds
are
nice
so
if
you
just
want
them
to
use
for
your
phone
or
for
your
kindle,
one
or
the
other,
highly
recommended
but
if
you
want
seamless
switching
and
full
multidevice
pairing,
you
need
to
keep
looking
had
these
for
about
year
because
don't
want
to
lose
the
more
expensive
apple
one
it
started
out
pretty
good
but
as
time
goes
on,
problems
start
popping
up
i've
list
some
major
issues
below0
signal
interference
if
go
somewhere
crowded,
often
experience
signal
interference
and
audio
becomes
laggy
also
happens
when
put
my
phone
on
my
person,
sometimes
when
turn
my
head,
can
hear
audio
issues,
it's
like
my
body's
blocking
the
signal0
improper
connection
over
time
i've
gotten
more
problems
with
connecting
and
disconnecting
have
to
do
lot
of
manually
connecting
and
disconnecting
lately
example,
yesterday
thought
my
phone's
speaker
was
broken,
but
after
examining
it
closely,
it
turns
out
the
earphones
are
still
connected
even
tho
put
them
in
the
box
for
recharge0
not
good
for
calling
or
receiving
calls
didn't
expect
or
demand
much
from
these
and
they
deliveredfirst
thing
noticed
was
that
they
didn't
have
any
different
sized
ear
plugs
to
swap
out,
but
that
wasn't
big
deal
as
the
ones
that
came
standard
seemed
to
work
the
charging
case
and
everything
else
was
great
what
was
odd
was
that
then
used
them,
my
wireless
signal
would
degrade
and
my
connection
would
dropi
think,
but
can't
prove,
that
the
earbuds
were
emitting
rf
noise
that
would
degrade
my
wireless
as
soon
as
disconnected
them
and
put
the
earbuds
in
the
charging
case,
everthing
was
finevendor
was
very
good
about
the
return
overall
give
these
earbuds
stars
because
they
are
very
good
buy
for
the
price
value
the
sound
quality
is
very
acceptable
in
my
opinion
though
realize
this
is
very
subjective
and
depends
what
you
listen
to
see
below
for
specificsthings
like:battery
life
is
good
when
you
factor
in
the
large
capacity
battery
in
the
charging
case,
units
that
cost
twice
as
much
have
much
smaller
capacitybuds
go
in
the
case
only
one
way
so
the
left
one
is
on
the
left
of
the
case,
the
right
one
on
the
rightvoice
prompting
tells
you
which
is
the
left
earbud
and
which
is
the
righti
feel
these
have
good
amount
of
bass
and
generally
good
sound
for
something
in
this
price
rangethings
don't
like:i
wish
the
earbuds
did
not
switch
on
if
the
battery
in
the
charging
case
diesi
also
wish
there
was
verbal
battery
level
indicator
the
earbuds
definitely
meet
my
expectations
and
are
great
value
for
the
price
have
found
the
sound
quality
to
be
very
good
but
it
is
dependent
on
two
things:
first,
you
need
to
adjust
your
eq
settings
within
your
music
player
to
amp
up
the
bass
in
order
to
get
full
richness
to
the
music
second,
you
need
to
find
the
right
eartips
for
good
solid
fit
as
well
had
an
extra
set
of
slightly
longer
silicon
ear
tips
that
used
and
they
worked
great
these
fit
perfectly
in
my
ears
and
barely
notice
wearing
them
while
moving
around
can
tap
on
either
earbud
to
play/pause
music
have
not
used
these
for
phone
calls,
but
that
is
not
feature
care
about
battery
life
is
as
advertised,
you
have
to
insure
that
the
earbuds
are
firmly
seated
in
the
charging
base
to
insure
that
they
are
charging,
any
bumping
of
the
case
may
cause
the
earbuds
to
move
and
not
charge
properly
out
of
the
box
i'm
impressed
with
the
build
quality
of
these
earbuds,
adjustable
volume
control,
clear
instructions
and
general
ease
of
use
although
supplied
with
numerous
sized
ear
pads
from
which
to
choose
the
best
fit
and
comfort
found
none
that
sufficiently
sealed
or
conformed
to
the
contours
of
my
ear
canals
the
consequence
of
this
is
that
volume
and
bass
seem
unacceptably
lacking,
most
notably
with
calls
received
and
with
listening
to
rock
music
while
operating
my
snow
blower
the
bottom
frequencies
are
so
appallingly
absent,
under
this
listening
condition
with
operating
heavy
machinery,
that
most
all
hear
of
my
music
is
beat
and
the
hiss
of
high
hat
with
that
i've
no
use
for
these
earbuds
so
pasonomi,
if
you're
reading
this
review,
think
you
have
an
otherwise
fine
product
here
with
exception
to
the
portion
that's
supposed
to
fit
and
fully
seal
the
ear
canal
yours
leak
beyond
this
free
eq
app
could
further
expand
audible
frequency
range
or
compensate
for
leaks
around
the
pads
as
is
i've
no
choice
but
to
reject
these
i'm
sorry
the
pairing
was
perfectly
easy
took
the
tab
off
the
magnetic
parts
on
the
buds,
placed
them
back
in
to
connect
and
then
back
out
to
pair
flawless
when
i'm
done
they
just
go
back
in
the
case
and
turn
off
the
bass
is
little
lacking,
but
i've
still
yet
to
find
good
pair
of
wireless
ones
that
do
have
good
bass
but
otherwise
they
sound
quality
is
great
noise
cancelling
is
efficient
the
shape
and
size
of
them
are
good
very
discrete
and
fit
into
the
canal
with
tight
fit
that
isn't
too
over
the
top
some
other
styles
was
deciding
between
looked
too
big/protruded,
but
these
are
slick
these
will
definitely
be
my
go
to
earbuds

i'm
not
wanting
wired

don't

other

this

is
good

at

is
not
that
much
strong,
if
its

down
it
will
broken
but
they
are
given
pouch
to
keep

don't
find
more
defects
love
that
the
ear
buds
come
in
case
that
charges
the
ear
buds
when
not
in
use
sounds
quality
is
decent
but
don't
have
the
best
ear
or
am
musically
included
so
for
normal
person
it
will
work
if
am
at
work
and
someone
comes
by
my
desk
don't
hear
them
overall
really
like
them
the
only
thing
that
is
kind
of
annoying
is
that
sometimes
i'll
go
on
run
with
them
and
then
put
them
back
in
their
case
but
if
someone
calls,
it
will
automatically
pick
up
on
the
ear
buds
making
me
think
something
is
wrong
with
my
phone————have
had
these
for
over
year
now
using
them
for
work
calls
clients
are
always
saying
they
have
issues
hearing
me
when
using
them
and
when
use
them
to
listen
to
calls,
it
will
disconnect
automatically
after
min
it
very
frustrating
it
didn
used
to
happen
just
started
happening
lately
overall,
decent
for
years
use
but
now
that
they
are
going
out
gonna
look
for
another
brand
not
good
enough
to
buy
again
believe
this
earbud
has
potentials,
but
it
needs
refinement,
especially
the
ear
tip
finish
this
finish
determines
how
much
bass
deliver
to
the
user
just
cannot
find
good
fit
using
all
provided
ear
tips
in
the
packages
the
current
ear
tip
is
too
flimsy,
not
working
with
my
ear
canal,
doesn't
fit
at
all,
it
slips
out
of
position
so
easily
that
have
to
keep
adjusting
while
am
running
that
is
big
hassle
but
when
it
works,
the
bass
delivered
is
great
it
disconnects
when
you
move
your
head
left
or
right,
you
got
to
maintain
still
this
proves
difficult
as
we
roadrunner,
we
constantly
have
to
watch
the
traffic
and
we
do
move
our
head
another
point:
when
charges
depleting,
so
does
the
connectivity
of
the
bluetooth,
that
don't
get
when
get
the
bass,
it
deserves
star,
when
it
doesn't,
start
believe
these
are
what
the
past
reviews
states0/0
updates
found
pair
of
earbuds
and
accidentally
fit
to
these,
excellent
bass,
sometimes
it
is
too
much
in
the
good
way
to
the
manufacturer,
if
am
you,
will
spend
some
money
into
research
and
find
some
earmuffs
that
fir
these
and
it
will
be
great

of
wireless
earbuds
make

several
other
brands
of
wireless
ear
buds
have
been
trying

for
reasonable

and
these
are
really
close
to
that
quality
of
the
over

high

phones,
and
much
better
than
any
cordless

as
well
and
returned
them
with
poor
poor

am
revising
my
review
after
contact
by
their
customer
service
they
do
not
like
bad
reviews
and
stood
on
their
head
to
make
me
happy
including
sending
another
pair
the
replacement

worked
excellent
as
expected
the
first

have
had
these
pasonomi
earbuds
for
few
months
now
and
absolutely
love
them
never
worry
about
having
to
charge
them
or
them
dying
as
the
battery
pack
that
holds
them
automatically
recharges
them
once
you
place
them
back
love
that
this
set
you
can
easily
tap
one
headphone
to
manage
the
controls
also
really
love
that
these
can
accomodate
one
headphone
at
time
do
have
to
take
both
pods
out
to
sync
and
then
put
back
one
so
the
other
one
pairs
sometimes
my
phone,
ipad
or
laptop
pairs
but
mostly
my
phone
first
since
thats
what
use
everyday
love
the
little
pouch
helps
keep
klutz
like
me
in
check
syncing
is
not
long
term
problem
if
need
to
sync
to
my

the

on
my

easily
be

had
these

they've

but
in
the
last
weeks
the
connection
to
my
phone
is
constantly
dropping

i'm

gotten
to
the
point

0/0/0**
seller
sent
me
new
pair,
despite
being
outside
of
months
warranty,
very
nice
to
work
with
i'll
update
my
post
to
let
you
know
how
they
are
working
tried
to
max
these
earbuds
for
the
past
two
days
and
really
wanted
to
love
them,
but
they
are
just
not
up
to
my
expectations
for
some
that
really
are
not
big
on
sound
quality
or
noise
cancellation,
they
might
be
great
the
one
thing
would
not
tolerate
was
the
battery
life
the
product
description
clearly
indicates
hours
of
battery
life
for
the
past
two
days
from
the
first
use,
have
gotten
exactly
hour
&
minutes
the
extra
minutes
may
not
be
big
issue
for
most
was
an
issue
for
me
the
sound
is
also
sub
par
for
my
liking
they
also
claimed
to
have
"quality
bass"
and
that
information
is
incorrect
the
bass
is
totally
not
there
and
the
treble
does
not
have
any
quality
again,
my
expectations
are
really
high
when
it
comes
to
soundi
hope
these
review
those
not
impact
those
they
are
just
looking
for
plain
wireless
earbuds
if
that
is
the
case,
these
are
great
option
did
not
test
the
water
proof
quality
so
cannot
comment
on
that
if
you
enjoy
being
frustrated
and
not
getting
what
you
want
out
of
life,
then
you
ll
love
this
product
first
of
all,
the
battery
life
blows
chunks
if
you
use
it
in
the
morning,
and
leave
the
ear
buds
off
the
charger
for
the
rest
of
the
day,
you
have
nothing
by
the
end
of
the
day
second
of
all,
the
right
earbud
just
stopped
connecting
to
bluetooth
after
the
first
use
tried
literally
everything
to
get
it
to
work
again
and
assure
you
that
wasn
user
error
thirdly,
the
sound
is
meh
lastly,
he
functions
on
the
ear
buds
themselves
are
not
easy
to
use
it
basically
just
shuts
off
and
on
when
you
barely
graze
the
ear
bud
seriously,
don
even
bother
try
another
brand
love
these
things
they
are
not
*perfect*
in
every
way
but
overall,
excellent
value
for
the
moneyvery
good
sound
quality
good
microphone
noise
cancelling
when
making
calls
from
noisy
room
decent
passive
ambient
noise
canceling
that
can
be
improved
with
simple
earbud
hack
with
foam
ear
plug
to
beef
up
the
ambient
noise
blocking
behind
the
thin
rubber
don't
understand
why
this
is
not
feature
from
the
manufacturers
of
"noisecanceling"
earbudsthese
are
easy
to
use
cannot
imagine
them
being
any
easier
to
use
after
first
time
setup,
it
is
just
matter
of
popping
them
in
and
out
of
the
charging
case
love
the
earbud
charging
case
its
charge
seems
to
last
foreverthe
only
real
complaint
have
is
that
wish
the
earbud
power
lasted
longer
between
charges
know
this
is
lot
to
ask
for
such
tiny
product
so,
think
will
buy
second
pair,
so
can
listen
to
one
while
the
other
is
charginging
it
takes
about
0hr
to
charge
for
hrs
of
listening
time
so
two
pairs
will
mean
practically
endless
listening
timesimply
the
best
bluetooth
accessory
have
ever
used
surprisingly,
for
such
hefty
price,
they
aren't
the
best
headphones
in
the
game
only
purchased
these
because
had
lost
pair
of
wonderful
enactrue
headphones
of
the
same
type,
and
after
using
those
once
again,
can
fully
say
these
are
not
at
all
worth
this
pricethey
simply
are
not
comfortable
the
touch
controls
feel
janky
and
sensitive
to
the
point
that
cannot
even
remove
them
without
spending
forty
seconds
turning
them
back
on
at
work,
this
can
be
very
annoying
occurrencethey
are
uncomfortable
and
do
not
go
fully
into
the
ear,
sort
of
maintaining
this
odd
balance
of
sticking
in
and
out
you
feel
like
they'd
fall
out
at
any
second
worst
part
is
try
to
push
them
back
in,
touch
control
got
activated
and
now
they're
trying
to
active
voice
search
on
your
device
it
is
irritating
to
no
faultthe
only
good
thing
about
them,
they
are
very
loud
headphones
you
could
blast
heavy
metal
until
your
socks
fall
off
and
your
ears
bleed,
but
the
latter
will
most
likely
just
happen
from
keeping
these
hard
pieces
of
plastic
jagging
into
my
eari
don't
recommend
you
waste
your
money
received
this
last
week
and
have
been
using
them
everyday
love
the
case
they
came
in
and
that
the
case
is
also
the
charging
station
very
convenient
they
fit
my
ears
well
and
don't
fall
out
like
how
they
easily
connect
blue
toothto
my
phone
and
my
ipad
i've
tried
them
once
in
the
shower
and
had
no
problems
frequently
watch
netflix
while
falling
asleep,
so
these
work
well,
to
use
in
bed
with
my
ipad
and
not
have
to
worry
about
twisting
and
pulling
the
cord
like
i've
always
had
to
do
with
the
apple
issued
earbuds
got
these
in
black
but
will
be
getting
white
pair
also
wish
someone
invented
tiny
earphones
like
these
with
an
app
that
would
allow
your
phone
to
find
them
this
aside,
these
earbuds
are
great
value
you
are
not
paying
for
brand
so
you
get
lot
of
hardware
for
the
moneythe
instructions
are
bit
obscure
as
usual
and
there
is
no
image
showing
you
where
to
tap
to
achieve
this
or
that
function
but
you
get
it
in
the
end
the
sound
is
natural,
not
distorted
towards
rich
bass
the
pairing
is
quick
and
seamless,
which
is
relief
use
the
gear
for
exercising
at
the
gym
and
for
long
walks
they
have
not
fallen
out
yet
can
walk
far
enough
from
the
phone
or
tablet
that
start
worrying
for
the
phone
itself
the
case
is
bit
hard
to
open
but
adequate
all
in
all
good
purchase,
if
can
find
the
box
at
the
bottom
of
my
gym
bag
purchased
these
headphones
for
myself
i'm
an
avid
podcast
listener,
but
only
like
to
listen
through
headphones
usually
while
doing
chores
around
the
house
have
several
sets
of
wireless
headphones,
but
wanted
some
earbuds
that
didn't
come
with
wraparound
neck
strap
like
other
athletic
bluetooth
earbuds
havethe
earbuds
themselves
are
pretty
good
they
power
on
and
connect
quickly,
and
the
sound
quality
is
on
par
with
every
other
set
i've
used
they
fit
comfortably
in
my
ear
and
haven't
ever
fallen
out
in
three
months
of
use
i've
never
exercised
while
using
them,
though,
so
can't
speak
to
how
securely
they
stay
in
during
activitiesthe
earbuds
also
come
in
great
little
carrying
case
they're
held
in
the
case
magnetically,
which
is
great
feature
also
love
that
the
case
includes
its
own
battery
the
earbuds
recharge
every
time
put
them
back
in
the
case,
and
just
need
to
periodically
recharge
the
case
you
can
also
charge
other
devices
by
connecting
usb
cable
to
the
case
this
is
my
favorite
part
about
the
earbudsi
have
three
major
issues
with
the
earbuds,
though
the
first
relates
to
the
design
each
earbud
has
button
used
for
controlling
volume
and
the
audio
the
button
is
not
physical
button,
but
rather
touchsensitive
portion
of
the
earbud
that
acts
as
button
it's
very
easy
to
inadvertently
press
this
button
while
inserting
or
adjusting
the
earbuds,
find
myself
accidentally
pausing
my
podcasts
all
the
time
this
takes
them
from
stars
to
starsthe
second
issue
is
with
the
volume
control
the
manual
doesn't
say
how
to
control
the
volume
eventually
realized
that
you
have
to
hold
one
of
the
earbud
buttons
the
left
decreases
volume,
while
the
right
increases
volume
you
have
to
hold
the
buttons
down
for
few
seconds
before
the
volume
starts
changing,
which
is
quite
annoying
the
volume
also
resets
to
maximum
every
time
you
power
the
earbuds
off
and
back
on,
so
you
can't
adjust
the
volume
to
comfortable
level
and
leave
it
there
it's
much
faster
to
just
adjust
the
volume
with
your
device
but,
if
you
have
increased
the
volume
on
your
device
since
using
these
earbuds
connect
to
my
car,
which
needs
the
device
volume
at
maximum,
you
will
deafen
yourself
every
time
you
connect
these
earbuds
while
you
frantically
try
to
turn
the
volume
down
this
takes
them
from
stars
to
starsthe
third
and
most
frustrating
issue
is
with
the
build
quality
at
first
glance,
the
earbuds
and
case
seem
to
be
built
quite
well
however,
after
less
than
month
of
use,
the
small
screen
on
the
tip
of
the
earbud
which
i'm
guessing
is
there
to
prevent
ear
wax
or
other
dirt
from
getting
into
the
earbud
itself
fell
off
did
not
abuse
the
headphones
in
any
way
rather,
the
screen
simply
fell
off
when
was
cleaning
the
earbud
tip
with
cotton
swab
think
the
screen
is
supposed
to
be
held
in
place
with
some
glue,
so
either
the
glue
wasn't
sufficient
or
wasn't
properly
applied
in
my
earbuds,
or
the
glue
isn't
sufficient
for
this
application
the
first
time
it
fell
off,
was
able
to
find
the
screen
and
put
it
back
in
place
it
fell
off
again
few
weeks
later,
though,
and
now
it's
gone
will
continue
to
use
the
earbuds,
but
suspect
that
they
will
eventually
fail
due
to
the
loss
of
this
screen
this
takes
them
from
stars
to
starsthese
earbuds
are
comfortable,
sound
good,
and
have
several
nice
features
that
really
make
them
stand
out
for
the
price
paid
for
these
earbuds,
though,
would
have
expected
that
they
be
bit
more
sturdy
and
resilient
to
basic
cleaning
and
maintenance
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
product
never
hearing
of
the
company
before
was
skeptical
about
the
quality
but
as
soon
as
opened
the
box
was
impressed
by
the
quality
and
packaging
the
earbuds
and
the
charging
station
both
appear
high
quality
and
sturdily
madethe
charging
station
works
well
as
travel
case
and
it
comes
with
little
bag
as
well,
which
is
great
for
my
taking
them
back
and
forth
between
home
to
work
the
magnetism
of
the
charging
station
is
nice
feature
as
well
snapping
in
place
and
staying
in
place
insuring
good
connection
for
charging
and
keeping
my
butterfingers
from
knocking
them
to
the
floor
they
also
came
with
number
of
extra
rubber
earpieces
of
different
sizes
so
they
can
be
changed
for
better
fit
or
to
replace
the
original
overtime
wasn't
sure
how
well
they
would
stay
in
place
but
haven't
had
any
issues
with
them
falling
out
and
they're
comfortablei
wear
them
lot
while
cleaning,
organizing
and
cooking
at
home
and
listening
to
both
music/books
and
chatting
on
the
phone
the
connection
to
my
phone
is
good
leaving
my
phone
on
the
dinning
room
table
can
work
in
any
room
of
my
0,0
sq
ft
condo
and
not
lose
connection
which
is
must
for
my
use
as
i'm
always
multitaskingsome
people
have
mentioned
not
liking
all
of
the
touch
controls
and
wishing
the
voice
command
could
be
turned
off
or
removed
personally,
really
like
this
feature
as
it
keeps
me
from
having
to
stop
what
i'm
doing
and
back
track
to
my
phone
when
its
in
the
other
room
it
took
few
minutes
of
playing
around
with
them
to
figure
it
out
tapping
to
start
and
pause,
holding
down
to
use
voice
command,
and
holding
for
longer
period
of
time
to
turn
the
volume
up
or
down
once
did
though
it
was
easy
and
feature
really
likemy
one
complaint
is
that
while
can
make
and
receive
calls
and
hear
the
other
person
clearly,
they
sometimes
struggle
to
understand
me
for
the
most
part
we
can
communicate
clearly
but
i'm
told
sound
muffled
and
occasionally
i'm
garbledif
the
clarity
of
calls
was
better
would
have
given
star
overall
i'm
really
happy
with
these
earbuds
and
they
will
be
replacing
my
older
pair
as
my
goto
set
tl;dr
0star
headphones
minus
one
star
for
the
microphone
quality
if
you're
not
planning
on
taking
calls
with
these,
consider
it
star
reviewif
you
want
comfortable,
lightweight,
decentsounding
headphones
for
your
workouts,
these
are
amazing
these
are
my
go
to
headphones
over
the
aukeys
and
the
plantronics
the
earbuds
are
light,
and
they
are
the
bestfitting
earbuds
i've
ever
tried;
most
earbuds
require
me
to
regularly
adjust
or
reset
them
to
make
sure
they
don't
fall
out,
but
these
just
sit
in
beautifullythe
sound
quality
is
pretty
good
can't
claim
to
be
an
expert
or
audiophile,
but
can
say
that
they
definitely
get
the
job
done
and
are
pleasant
to
listen
to
for
long
periods
of
timethe
one
caveat
is
the
microphone
the
microphone
quality
is
well,
rough
at
best
someone
might
be
able
to
understand
you
if
you're
at
home,
but
if
you're
at
the
gym
there's
no
way
people
will
hear
you
clearly
enough
to
be
understood
however,
if
you're
buying
these
for
the
same
use
case
as
me
gym
headphones,
and
sometimes
wireless
headphones
around
the
house,
these
are
pretty
great
the
case
charges
the
headphones
and
as
result
have
never
had
the
battery
die
on
me
midworkout
bought
this
specifically
for
work
before
my
store
opens,
we
spend
three
hours
stocking
the
floor
like
to
listen
to
my
own
music
and
would
find
my
wired
headphones
would
get
caught
or
stuck
somewhere
whilst
would
stock
searched
for
weeks
for
pair
of
wireless
earbuds
and
finally
decided
on
these
have
an
iphone
and
wanted
something
more
comfy
and
affordable
than
airpods
these
earbuds
last
about
hours
with
full
use
of
music
and
siri
you
can
use
both
earbuds
or
just
one
at
time
the
case
is
sturdy
and
can
charge
both
your
earbuds
and
phone
have
had
these
for
almost
month
now
and
have
yet
to
recharge
the
case,
which
is
surprise
since
use
these
times
week
with
setting
late
night/party
on
the
iphone,
the
bass
and
music
sounds
much
better
the
only
cons
are
that
sometimes
you
have
issues
connecting
to
bluetooth,
but
that's
an
easy
fix
also,
since
these
are
in
your
ear,
you
have
to
constantly
clean
the
wax
off,
but
that
is
normal
would
highly
recommend
these
earbuds
and
would
buy
again
if
anything
ever
happened
to
these
was
hoping
not
to
spend
too
much
money
on
pair
of
wireless
headphones
for
my
pixel
device,
but
should
have
done
more
research
to
what
workspairing
them
both,
only
one
of
them
works
at
time
tapping
the
headphone
will
pause
the
song,
and
double
tapping,
depending
whether
it
is
the
left
or
right
headphone
will
skip
forward
or
backwards
track
calls
coming
in
do
work
with
the
headphonesin
my
experience,
the
headphones
each
last
roughly
hours
if
you're
not
using
them,
it's
best
to
put
them
back
in
the
case
as
they
tend
to
run
out
of
juice
fast

the
charging
case
does
have
enough
juice
to
support
lot
of
recharges
having
said
this,
make
sure
to
keep
the
charging
case
with
you
for
long
tripsuse
the
cable
provided
in
the
box
to
charge
the
case
and
headphones
as
for
the
quality
of
the
sound,
it
does
the
job
however,
if
you
are
ordering
something
from
store,
and
you
are
listening
to
music
in
one
ear,
it's
best
to
just
take
them
out
leaving
them
in,
it
will
be
difficult
to
hear
the
other
person
these
were
christmas
gift
for
family
member,
my
brother
he
is
into
sports
and
stay
active
and
was
in
market
for
this
kind
of
product
tried
looking
up
various
options
at
amazon
and
other
places
the
name
brands
are
north
of
$0
and
these
ones
fit
my
budget
and
had
good
features
compared
to
other
models
and
brands
viewed
the
ipx0
waterproof,
touch
controls,
charging
capabilities,
and
battery
capacity
stood
out
among
other
optionswhen
tried
them,
admittedly
for
short
period,
they
fit
nice
in
the
ears
tried
running
around
with
no
problems
with
the
fit,
connectivity
and
controlsonly
negative,
and
one
star
less
for
that,
was
the
sound
quality
it
wasn't
bad,
but
it
wasn't
any
great
either
these
are
probably
good
on
the
go
for
the
convenience
but
definitely
not
for
just
enjoying
the
musichope
this
helps
this
hands
down
is
great
bargain,
compared
friend's
galaxy
buds,
anywhere
from
to
dollars
more
and
here's
my
conclusion
these
buds
are
exactly
the
same
if
not
better
plus
they
have
charge
indicator
blue
dots
and
they
have
usb
out
to
charge
yet
another
device
if
needed,
none
of
which
the
galaxy
buds
case
has
and
initially
thought
they
didn't
take
calls
without
having
to
use
your
phone
to
speak,
however
am
happy
to
say
they
work
independently
of
your
phone
to
take
calls
threw
my
phone
in
the
back
seat
under
pile
of
clothes
and
the
other
person
heard
me
just
as
clearly
as
if
were
using
the
phone
itself
so
if
you're
skeptical
about
the
value
in
these
buds
don't
be,
you
will
not
regret
this
purchase
bravo
to
you
pasonomi,
keep
up
the
good
work
the
sound
quality
is
decent,
not
as
good
as
say
jabra
or
bose
earbuds,
but
not
far
off
once
added
comply
tips
instead
of
the
ones
provided
each
earbud
can
be
used
independently
if
you
like
and
both
have
mic
not
feature
that
all
brands
prioritized
wish
the
charging
case
had
place
to
store
extra
tips
or
accommodated
larger
sizes
my
comply
tips
have
deeper
profile
than
the
stock
tips
therefore
get
too
squished
and
damaged
when
placed
in
the
case,
so
have
to
carry
my
tips
in
another
case
or
pocket
otherwise
love
these
and
would
buy
again
at
my
original
$0
purchase
price
would
pay
more
for
newer
version
if
the
case
came
with
storage
room
for
tips,
and
if
the
and
buds
had
different
device
names
it's
hard
to
know
which
one
you're
connecting
to
via
bluetooth,
they
have
the
same
name
these
headphones
were
so
good,
that
bought
second
pair
as
gift
i've
been
using
them
for
couple
months
the
battery
life
is
about
four
hours
on
charge
and
the
charging
case
works
great
as
both
an
earbud
charger
or
phone
charger
the
touch
controls
are
surprisingly
good
you
can
volume
down
on
the
left,
volume
up
on
the
right,
skip
forward/backward
by
double
tapping
either
the
left
or
right
phone
calls
are
clearer
than
expected
the
instructions
tell
you
to
hold
one
earbud
to
your
mouth
and
keep
the
other
in
your
ear
to
clearly
make
calls
so
far,
it
works
great
for
me
to
just
keep
them
both
in
my
ears
pairing
is
also
super
easy
and
works
almost
instantly
they
are
much
cheaper
than
some
of
the
more
well
known
brands,
but
see
no
reason
to
spend
the
extra
money
use
them
running
and
at
work
they've
never
fallen
out
they
are
also
more
low
profile
than
some
other
bluetooth
headphones,
which
like
unusable
at
work
spend
more
time
putting
them
in
the
case
to
reset
them,
and
turning
my
blue
tooth
on
&
off
to
get
just
one
to
work
for
few
minutes
left
side
as
standalone
will
at
least
take
phone
calls,
at
least
when
it
isnt
connecting
and
reconnecting
to
the
right
bud
non
stop
right
side
wont
take
call
at
all
and
gifts
me
with
horrible
squelch
in
my
ear
before
it
freezezs
up
for
just
music,
when
they
do
work,
am
lucky
to
get
hours
overall
majorly
dissappoited
with
this
"brand"
of
wireless
earphones
am
currently
looking
for
another
kind
to
try
out
don
understand
why
these
earbuds
have
such
bad
reviews
my
brother
had
pair
of
these
and
recommended
them
to
me
and
they
lasted
years
for
me
loved
them
and
planning
on
getting
new
pair
they
only
just
recently
stopped
working
because
the
power
button
on
the
side
of
the
case
became
loose
and
they
ve
been
connecting
to
my
phone
unexpectedly
not
super
upset
since
they
ve
lasted
so
well
for
years
especially
since
very
clumsy
person
and
have
dropped/accidentally
threw
them
on
multiple
occasions
with
only
few
scratches
ve
also
compared
these
with
someone
air
pods
and
they
are
equally
as
good
at
reasonable
priceif
you
fully
charge
the
entire
case
it
can
last
couple
of
days
while
when
the
ear
buds
are
fully
charged
they
last
around
hours
the
sound
quality
is
great
also
but
they
aren
as
noise
canceling
as
headphones
but
they
can
block
out
the
noise
of
loud
classroom
so
that
good
enough
in
my
booksthe
only
issue
ve
ever
had
is
that
if
you
only
want
to
use
one
earbud
at
once
you
have
to
use
the
left
one
to
turn
them
on
you
just
have
to
pull
both
of
them
out
of
the
case
and
the
connect
via
bluetooth
then
if
you
want
to
only
use
one
you
have
to
put
the
right
one
back
if
you
put
the
left
one
back
it
disconnects
bothreally
recommend
these
might
even
see
if
can
still
use
my
old
pair
they
might
just
not
work
right
now
cause
they
re
dead
lol
ve
used
these
now
for
about
month
and
really
like
them
they
are
the
most
comfortable
earbuds
ve
ever
worn
have
hard
time
getting
ear
buds
to
stay
in
my
ear
and
they
do
well
don
know
how
well
they
stay
in
during
an
intense
work
out
with
lots
of
movement
like
kicking
boxing
or
aerobic
but
they
do
great
for
on
the
elliptical
at
pretty
intense
setting,
just
walking
around
or
sittingi
love
that
can
pause
what
listening
to
by
tapping
the
ear
bud
will
pause
youtube
video
by
taping
and
that
the
bluetooth
turns
off
when
put
them
back
in
the
charging
case,
so
don
have
to
go
into
settings
to
do
it
the
charge
seems
to
hold
well
but
only
use
them
daily
for
about
an
hour
at
time
while
work
out
and
then
put
them
back
in
the
case
so
am
not
sure
how
long
the
charge
would
last
without
doing
that
usually
use
earbuds
for
0hrs+
day
and
these
held
up
pretty
well
so
far
noise
cancelling
works
pretty
well
as
was
using
hair
dryer
with
these
in
and
couldn't
hear
the
hair
dryer
with
sound
on
so
that's
nice
working
out
in
them
was
fine
no
problems
so
far
the
only
thing
is
that
wish
the
battery
lasted
longernote:
the
manual
instruction
to
pair
the
earbuds
should
say
to
touch
them
together
to
repair
them
after
you
unpair
them
it
took
few
tries
to
figure
that
out
lol
my
experience
in
the
months
of
owning
them
is
that
the
sound
quality
is
decent
if
you're
looking
to
just
listen
to
music
through
them,
these
are
good
cheap
alternative
to
other
expensive
earbuds
however,
i've
experienced
issues
with
pairing,
both
connecting
and
disconnecting
from
my
phone
sometimes
you
can't
get
them
into
pairing
mode
and
other
times
you
put
the
earbuds
in
the
case
and
they
stay
paired
knock
star
off
for
that
i'm
not
sure
if
there
is
any
noise
cancellation
or
if
these
are
meant
to
be
used
for
phone
calls,
but
these
seem
to
operate
as
an
eavesdropping
device
instead
of
speaker
when
on
the
phone
everyone
has
told
me
they
only
hear
background
noise
and
not
my
voice,
so
you
can't
really
use
them
for
calling
anyone
unless
you're
in
silent
room
knock
another
star
for
that
stars
seems
fair
spend
the
extra
money
if
you
want
better
bluetooth
and
phone
quality
*edit*
the
company
contacted
me
and
sent
me
new
pair
of
earbuds
because
the
ones
may
were
suspected
to
be
defective,
but
the
new
ones
were
exactly
the
same
even
had
two
people
double
check
these
earbuds
for
bass
and
both
agreed
these
have
no
bass
appreciate
the
effort
of
customer
service
but
in
the
end
the
product
is
of
poor
quality
*/edit*the
description
says
"resonant
bass"
but
there
was
virtually
no
bass
at
all
tried
to
work
out
with
these
but
the
bass
less
music
could
not
pump
me
up
and
it
was
extremely
disappointing
these
are
easily
the
worst
earphones
i've
ever
used
in
my
life
returned
them
don't
understand
the
star
reviews
i'm
no
audiophile
just
appreciate
good
sounding
music
the
earphones
that
came
with
my
iphone
and
this
other
$0
earphone
that
purchased
few
years
ago
sounded
far
superior
to
this
again,
there
is
no
bass
this
is
not
good
for
music
at
all
bought
these
wireless
bluetooth
earbuds
because
work
out
lot
and
the
cords
on
my
regular
headphones
get
in
the
way
or
cause
my
earbuds
to
fall
out
it's
incredibly
annoying
and
potentially
dangerous
when
running
on
the
treadmill
or
lifting
weights
was
worried
about
how
these
would
stay
in
my
ears,
but
they
come
with
many
different
size
silicone
pieces
that
allow
you
to
customize
the
fit
to
your
particular
ears
they
work
like
charm
they
fit
nice
and
snug
and
do
not
feel
like
they
will
fall
out
i'm
highly
impressed
by
the
sound
quality
as
well,
it's
clear
and
the
volume
is
great
plan
to
buy
more
if
these
for
christmas
gifts
this
year
:
ve
been
through
sets
of
wireless
ear
buds
and
these
are
by
far
my
favorite
everything
was
packaged
nicely,
the
design
is
sleek,
the
ear
buds
are
sturdy
and
fit
nicely
they
synced
easily,
they
power
on
and
connect
instantly
when
removed
from
the
case
that
the
best
other
ear
buds
ve
used
have
had
to
be
manually
powered
on
and
there
is
usually
lag
time
to
power
on
and
connect
appreciate
the
features
of
the
charging
bank
–
charges
fast,
holds
charge
and
will
also
charge
other
devices
each
bud
lasts
little
over
hours
which
is
typical
for
other
buds
ve
used
really
like
pair
that
last
0+
hours
ve
only
used
this
for
music
so
can
rate
the
call
feature
but
the
sound
quality
is
a+
the
only
reasonable
improvements
would
suggest
is
longer
usb
cable
and
proof
reading
the
instruction
manual
for
mistakes
received
this
headphones
recently
and
want
to
share
my
first
impressions
on
the
product
first
of
all,
the
price
was
very
reasonable
for
this
type
of
headphones
they
come
in
an
ergonomic
designbox
which
is
also
power
bank
that
you
use
for
charging
the
headphones
could
have
charged
the
headphones
times
and
there
was
power
bank
had
still
half
of
its
juice
left
in
it
in
each
charging
could
have
listened
music
approximately
hours
they
come
with
different
sizes
rubber
tips,
the
second
smallest
one
worked
best
for
me
they
did
not
fall
off
even
when
ran
had
no
issues
connecting
it
my
phone
it
is
very
important
for
me
that
they
have
very
good
sound
qualityoverall,
think
these
are
great
headphones,
particularly
if
you
move
around
in
your
workplace
and
when
you
travel
good
sound,
and
you
get
lot
of
use
on
single
charge
ve
used
them
at
the
gym
and
they
mostly
stay
put
but
think
if
was
running
be
concerned
about
them
falling
out
using
the
largest
plugs
but
they
still
want
to
move
around
well
for
starters
would
like
to
say
didn
have
the
highest
of
hopes
for
these
things
but
that
isn
their
fault
it
has
everything
to
do
with
the
fact
that
work
in
factory
environment
for
long
hours
day
so
when
say
that
am
surprised
with
not
only
the
sound
quality
but
the
noise
canceling
am
being
serious
loud
metal
production
shop
and
can
hear
my
music
perfectly
over
the
noise
and
even
with
the
music
stopped
have
to
lean
in
to
hear
coworker
talk
with
these
in
the
battery
life
isn
the
greatest
but
that
is
honestly
me
being
picky
if
can
work
ten
hours
day
why
can
these
things
well
if
just
isn
logical
at
this
point
yet
so
it
is
just
annoying
but
hours
per
quick
charge
isn
bad
but
yes
they
do
charge
up
pretty
quickly
slap
them
on
the
charger
on
my
breaks
and
lunches
and
it
keeps
me
jamming
all
through
work
so
guess
shouldn
complain
haven
tested
the
water
resistant
aspect
of
it
and
can
say
want
to
have
tested
the
sweat
part
of
it
quite
often
and
it
holds
up
just
fine
know
some
people
complain
about
them
not
connecting
when
you
pull
them
off
the
charger
well
put
them
back
on
the
charger
wait
for
blinky
it
will
be
red
just
like
when
it
is
charging
and
them
pull
them
off
the
charger
and
cram
them
into
the
ear
holes
and
off
you
go
the
first
set
received
was
defective
the
left
speaker
was
significantly
lighter
in
volume
than
the
right
speaker
tried
recalibration
with
no
success
returned
through
amazon
because
the
customer
service
department
didn't
respond
few
weeks
later
received
an
email
from
manufacturer
and
they
offered
to
replace
my
device
at
no
cost,
even
though
had
returned
through
amazon
i'm
pleased
with
the
second
set
the
volume
is
good,
battery
life
is
as
good
as
you
can
expect
with
the
small
size,
sound
is
good,
fit
is
good
and
they
aren't
too
heavy
can't
use
them
when
exercising,
they
fall
out,
but
they
are
great
for
light
activity
around
the
house,
washing
dishes,
folding
laundry,
etc
good
product,
just
be
aware
that
they
aren't
for
heavy
exercise
i'm
very
pleased
with
customer
service
update:
customer
service
reached
out
to
me,
offering
both
refund
and
replacement
they
shipped
it
fast
as
well
they
deserve
0star
for
that
the
replacement
pairs
work
great
so

review:got
these
as
valentine
gift
i've
been
wanting
to
have
wireless
earbud
for
while
and
my
husband
didn't
disappoint
me
however,
the
earbuds
do
not
deliver
wanted
these
because
want
to
stay
on
the
phone
with
my
hubby
0/0
like
jim
and
pam
lol
excuse
me,
but
called
my
mom
and
she
couldn't
hear
me
the
mic
quality
seems
really
poor,
the
¢0
earphones
got
worked
betteri
really
wanted
to
like
them
there
was
neither
the
manual
nor
the
charging
cords
nor
the
buds
in
the
box
and
that's
pretty
disappointing
as
welli
agree
with
many
negative
comments
as
it's
almost
impossible
to
readjust
the
ear
pieces
without
pause
or
skip
the
music
think
it's
cool
feature
but
also
bit
inconveniencesounds
quality
and
the
material
are
top
notch
otherwise
they
truly
drown
out
the
surrounding
sounds
when
placed
properly
had
no
problem
connecting
sides
together
the
pasonomi
wireless
earbuds
can
be
described
in
single
sentence,
the
earbuds
you
were
worried
about
receiving
after
reading
countless
reviews,
thought
these
buds
were
no
brainer,
something
easy
to
throw
in
while
running
and
forget
that
they
re
even
there
when
you
get
your
pair
you
ll
be
greeted
by
sleek
samsung
like
box
that
makes
this
look
like
high
quality
product
you
ll
pull
small
tab
and
reveal
the
absolutely
massive
charging
case
covered
in
lint
and
other
debris
next,
you
ll
struggle
to
open
the
case
for
few
minutes
fiddling
with
the
cheap
plastic
lid
finally,
you
see
the
reason
you
dropped
dollars
on
these
chinese
earbuds,
sleek
wireless
earbud
system
for
quarter
of
the
price
anxiously
you
ll
throw
them
on
and
put
on
your
favorite
song,
and
here
where
this
product
turns
into
one
of
the
worst
things
ve
purchased
on
amazon
the
sound
quality
can
be
described
as
sickly
an
extremely
nasally,
bland,
bassless
sound
is
all
that
these
earbuds
will
provide
the
only
good
thing
can
say
is
that
they
stay
in
the
ear
and
they
have
good
bluetooth
if
that
all
that
you
re
looking
for
otherwise,
if
you
re
in
it
for
sound
quality
just
use
some
beat
up
old
apple
headphones
because
can
guarantee
you
ll
have
better
listening

will
say
it
does
get
little
annoying
whenever
accidentally
touch
them
and
it
pauses,
but
don
mind
it
too
much
they
re
definitely
worth
it
it
says
it
waterproof
and
for
the
most
part
that
seems
to
be
true
wouldn
recommend
accidentallly
putting
them
through
the
washing
machine
however
one
of
them
stopped
working
after
that
but
impressively
the
other
one
was
still
working
emailed
pasonomi
about
it
and
they
sent
me
new
ones
without
any
charges
they
were
really
nice
and
the
process
was
super
easy
0/0
would
recommend
bought
this
as
last
minute
pair
b/c
my
other
wireless
was
put
through
the
wash
and
needed
something
quick
for
my
vacation
turns
out
this
was
great
purchase
paired
easily
with
my
note
and
iphone
xr
never
have
an
issue
with
battery
life,
and
even
used
it
to
recharge
my
note
had
no
issues
in
the
pool
or
showering
the
only
complaint
is
that
the
charging
case
is
little
too
big
to
carry
comfortably
in
your
jean
pockets
but
worked
well
in
my
slingback
or
carpenter
shorts
mind
you,
these
are
not
beats
but
the
sound
quality
is
great
for
the
price
and
do
not
believe
in
spending
that
kind
of
money
for
something
that
can
so
easily
lose
hope
this
helps
as
there
are
lot
of
choices
out
there
overall
an
excellent
product
tried
these
wireless
earbuds
for
the
first
time
the
best
part
of
them
is
the
way
they
fit
in
my
ears
they
stay
put
while
exercising
for
the
most
partonce
in
while
need
to
readjust
now
keep
in
mind,
have
exceptionally
small
ears
for
grownup
and
am
yet
to
find
any
headphone
buds
nonwireless
that
stayed
put
in
my
ears
these
are
the
firstas
for
sound,
the
sound
comes
through
very
clear
but
am
still
able
to
hear
people
talking
as
mom,
prefer
this
versus
complete
elimination
of
background
noise
in
case
my
son
or
husband
is
trying
to
speak
with
mei
love
the
charging/storage
casevery
compact
and
easy
to
charge
and
travel
with
the
extra
ear
bud
covers
are
also
nice
just
in
case
loose
one
or
they
get
dirty
from
use
am
not
too
into
the
latest
and
greatest
with
electronics
but
have
to
say
these
are
very
convenient
and
sooo
much
better
than
having
to
use
headphones
with
cord
getting
tangled
every
minutes
am
very
happy
with
my
purchasegreat
value
for
what
you
are
getting
these
headphones
have
been
really
great,
use
them
paired
with
my
tablet
when
cook
and
clean
and
it
great
before
used
to
have
trouble
hearing
when
would
wash
dishes
and
vacuum
but
obviously
couldn
hear
the
music
or
show
was
playing
these
are
very
comfortable
haven
tried
the
different
sizes
yet,
but
am
curious
which
one
should
be
using
ll
update
when
try
thembattery
life:
haven
had
any
issues
but
also
haven
used
it
for
extensive
amount
of
time
and
always
put
them
back
in
the
case
which
charges
them
ve
had
them
few
weeks
and
haven
had
to
charge
the
case
yeti
haven
tried
running
or
doing
lot
of
physical
activity
so
am
unable
to
comment
on
that
but
they
are
comfortable
and
convenient
really
like
these
earbuds
for
the
price
they
fit
well,
i'm
able
to
run
and
sleep
with
them
in
they
don't
feel
like
they
are
going
to
fall
out
and
they
easily
sync
with
my
phone
the
first
pair
received,
the
right
one
wouldn't
charge
however,
after
emailing
the
company
they
got
right
on
it
asked
me
for
few
pictures
and
send
me
replacement
pair
easy
peasy
plus,
got
to
keep
the
left
one
that
did
work,
which
is
nice
to
have
backup
when
i'm
running
half
marathon
or
something
and
run
outta
power
have
nothing
bad
to
say
about
this
product,
company
or
customer
service
thanks
for
getting
me
up
and
going
with
truly
wireless
earbuds
at
great
price
:d
was
blown
away
with
the
amount
of
technology
built
into
these
tiny
packages
no
tethers
to
get
entangled,
good
quality
sound
and
has
surprising
battery
life
hardware
is
not
flimsy
either
it
takes
few
laps
around
the
track
to
remember
which
teeny
button
to
press
which
way
but
they
work
all
for
under

grade
managed
to
catch
it
and
reinsert
it
before
the
bottom
of
the
hill
with
eye
of
the
tiger
still
blaring
hope
this
company
continues
to
keep
their
quality
control
as
top
priority
there
quite
enough
junk
out
there
already
these
are
definitely
worth
the
price
of
admissioni
had
considered
the
apple
wireless
earbuds,
but
gave
these
shot
as
at
the
selling
price
you
can
go
through
few
sets
and
still
come
out
ahead
the
only
thing
that
concerned
me
was
the
sound
quality
and
if
it
would
measure
upwhen
first
received
them
was
eager
to
try
them
out
and
charged
them
up
fully,
which
went
fairly
quickly
and
easy
to
track
with
the
indicator
lights,
then
popped
them
in
to
give
them
spin
the
pairing
went
quite
easily
and
started
listening
to
some
familiar
music
the
touch
to
pause
works
very
well
and
is
more
useful
than
had
imagined
this
can
also
be
used
to
summon
your
voice
assistant
siri,
google
they
also
come
with
generous
selection
of
ear
tips
and
spares
as
well
as
an
unexpected
nice
drawstring
pouch
for
the
entire
unitat
first
the
sound
was
little
thin
and
was
wondering
if
this
was
to
be
expected
as
am
used
to
over
the
ear
cans
instead
of
ear
budsafter
adjusting
them
in
my
ears
figured
out
that
the
medium
small
rubber
tips
that
came
on
the
buds
by
default
were
not
sealing
well
with
my
ears
and
changing
them
to
pair
of
the
larger
included
tips
were
in
orderbetween
the
ear
tip
change
and
giving
them
bit
of
time
to
break
in
brought
an
entirely
different
soundscape
full
and
lush
like
was
hoping
and
the
longer
listen
they
seem
to
be
opening
up
even
more
only
couple
of
hours
playtime
so
farif
your
on
the
fence,
can
say
myself
am
pleased
with
the
sound
and
mildly
surprised
just
how
darn
good
they
are
for
this
price
pair
vs
the
other
while
am
at
work
left
goes
in
and
out
atleast
every
mins
i'm
tired
of
hearing
the
beeps
"disconnected"
beeps
"connectedright
side
got
quite
week
or
after
using
it
it
is
very
noticeably
reduced
in
powerboth
struggle
to
charge
every
so
often
cleaned
them
and
the
plates
on
the
case
with
alcohal
couple
times
now
and
they
work
well
again
for
that
day,
but
struggle
again
the
nexti
was
soo
happy
with
these
to
start
and
recommended
them
to
people
now
i'm
in
the
market
for
new
set
and
growing
to
hate
these
very
frustrationit's
bit
bulky
feeling
in
the
ear
also
and
often
cause
my
ear
to
start
aching
bought
these
about
year
and
half
ago
for
fifty
bucks,
you'll
probably
get
your
money's
worth,
but
if
had
it
to
do
over
again,
i'd
go
for
higher
quality
model
that
has
partly
to
do
with
the
fact
that
the
technology
has
improved
significantly
in
the
last
few
years,
so
you
could
probably
get
more
for
your
money
now
than
when
first
got
these
the
battery
life
per
ear
bud
is
about
hours,
and
that
has
dropped
slightly
over
the
course
of
time
the
case
battery
has
gotten
significantly
worse
use
these
close
to
hours
week,
and
at
first,
the
case
battery
would
last
week
or
two
now,
have
to
charge
it
every
couple
of
days
i've
only
used
it
once
to
charge
my
phone,
and
doubt
you
could
get
one
full
charge
out
of
it
the
sound
quality
is
better
than
some
wired
pairs
i've
had,
but
it's
definitely
not
legendary,
and
i've
noticed
slight
eq
imbalance
between
the
two
from
day
one
also,
before
forget
it,
these
are
not
active
noise
cancelling
ergonomicly
they
are
average
know
lot
of
people
have
trouble
with
this
kind
falling
out
of
their
ears
have
never
had
that
trouble,
but
it
may
be
do
to
with
the
fact
that
put
on
rubber
tips
from
may
favorite
brand
of
wired
ear
buds
pairing
wise,
they
are
often
nightmare
the
right
side
tries
to
connect
to
the
left
before
connecting
to
your
phone,
which
can
be
quite
annoying
if
you're
using
it
individually
they
also
have
interference
issues
if
they're
too
hot
or
cold
in
short,
i'd
say
you
get
what
you
pay
for
ll
start
off
by
saying
that
don
write
reviews
very
often
for
products
purchase
online
but
felt
compelled
to
do
so
based
on
my
satisfaction
with
these
headphones
ll
admit
that
was
hesitant
even
at
the
low
price
point
to
buy
these
headphones
based
on
some
of
the
reviews
had
read
about
poor
sound
quality
and
limited
bass
was
expecting
to
be
disappointed
with
the
quality
but
knew
that
could
get
full
refund
if
that
was
the
case
made
the
purchase
on
sunday
and
received
the
headphones
on
tuesday
the
packaging
was
satisfying
for
product
at
the
price
point
out
of
the
box
the
setup
was
extremely
simple
the
headphones
and
charging
case
were
mostly
charged
upon
arrival
so
all
had
to
do
was
take
the
earbuds
out
of
the
charging
case
and
search
for
x0
in
the
list
of
bluetooth
options
on
my
phones
that
it
the
earbuds
automatically
turn
on
once
removed
from
the
case
this
is
an
attractive
feature
for
me
since
some
of
the
wireless
headphones
have
owned
in
the
past
have
had
power
on/off
buttons
that
were
hard
to
press
and
subject
to
malfunction
after
year
or
so
the
main
reason
purchased
these
earbuds
is
to
use
when
run
and
do
other
physical
activities
like
mow
the
grass
or
work
around
the
house
also
own
pair
of
bose
sound
sport
wireless
headphones
which
sound
amazing
but
have
cord
around
the
neck
that
can
get
really
annoying
on
long
run
not
surprisingly,
these
earbuds
don
quite
stack
up
to
my
bose
model
in
terms
of
sound
quality
but
the
quality
is
actually
really
good
compared
to
other
headphones
ve
owned
in
the
$0+
range
ll
still
plan
to
use
my
bose
headphones
when
watching
show
on
my
ipad
or
movie
for
this
reason
ll
also
say
that
was
surprised
at
how
comfortable
these
earbuds
are
had
fully
expected
to
be
disappointed
with
the
fit
when
running
or
doing
physical
activities
ve
used
these
times
now
to
run
and
mow
the
grass
and
have
never
felt
like
they
were
going
to
fall
out
of
my
ear
the
charging
case
is
major
upside
that
can
just
pop
them
right
back
in
the
case
after
workout
and
not
have
to
fool
with
finding
the
right
charging
cable
and
plug
into
the
wall
each
time
the
case
itself
holds
lot
of
power
ve
used
these
earbuds
all
week
and
the
charging
case
is
still
over
0/0
full
anticipate
ll
only
need
to
charge
the
case
itself
about
once
month
the
only
drawback
can
see
so
far
is
that
haven
figured
out
how
to
keep
one
earbud
in
the
charging
case
and
use
the
other
like
ve
heard
about
each
time
try
this
the
headphones
shut
off
maybe
it
something
doing
wrong
though
because
haven
seen
lot
of
complaints
about
this
in
the
reviews
ll
also
say
that
the
call
quality
isn
all
that
great
compared
to
other
more
expensive
models
can
hear
the
voice
on
the
other
end
very
clearly
but
ve
been
told
my
voice
is
little
hard
to
hear
like
talking
in
tunnel
this
honestly
doesn
bother
me
much
though
since
didn
purchase
the
earbuds
for
that
function
overall,
extremely
happy
with
the
purchase
blown
away
by
the
quality
of
this
product
at
$0
don
hesitate
to
purchase
yourself
if
you
are
on
the
fence
especially
if
you
are
looking
for
pair
to
use
while
running
these
are
terrible
immediately
you
can
see
and
feel
that
these
are
just
cheap
chinese
product
they
work
great
for
the
first
couple
weeks
but
then
the
right
earbud
always
goes
out
have
reset
the
earbuds,
phone
and
done
all
the
trouble
shooting
you
can
do
to
get
the
volume
back
in
the
right
ear
bud
have
ordered
these
twice
and
the
right
ear
bud
always
fails
after
few
weeks
with
just
normal
wear
will
say
they
sound
great,
fit
well
and
very
small
compared
to
otheri'd
advise
just
sucking
it
up
and
spending
the
extra
money
in
quality
wireless
ear
buds
it
isn't
worth
it
to
constantly
deal
with
this
issue
have
wireless
beat
studio
that
used
before
but
wanted
something
more
low
profile
but
will
go
back
to
those
until
can
get
more
superior
earbud
than
these
have
had
my
beats
for
almost
three
years
now
and
no
issues
what
so
ever
have
even
gotten
them
wet
and
they
still
work
perfectlyjust
invest
in
the
higher
quality
earbuds
these
aren't
worth
it
unless
you
like
wasting
your
time
the
higher
quality
are
completely
worth
it
be
winner
and
save
yourself
the
agony
and
time
to
deal
with
this
malarkey
am
always
skeptical
of
using
products
am
not
familiar
with
the
brand
name
when
received
the
product
it
was
packaged
well
it
included
very
easy
to
understand
instructions
had
no
problem
pairing
the
earphones
to
my
phone
they
are
very
comfortable
on
my
ear
they
fit
very
snug
and
am
not
concerned
with
them
falling
out
they
provide
extra
earbud
covers
so
you
can
find
the
right
size
for
your
ear
the
sound
quality
is
pretty
good
would
say
comparable
to
name
brand
wireless
earbuds
own
while
have
only
used
these
for
few
days,
would
say
these
are
solid
pair
of
earbudsdisclaimer:
was
provided
free
product
in
return
for
my
honest
review
all
thoughts
and
opinions
expressed
here
are
my
own
and
not
influenced
by
the
developing
company
and/or
its
affiliates,
in
anyway
have
had
these
ear
buds
for
about
months
now,
and
have
used
them
lot
listen
to
music
when
working
on
my
house,
or
doing
yard
work
the
sound
is
good
if
could
upgrade
the
sound
would
like
little
more
punch
to
the
bass,
but
like
deep
bass
the
pairing
is
simple
to
do
and
you
can
pair
them
individually
which
is
great
for
the
price
these
are
great
and
really
enjoy
themthe
two
biggest
problems
have
found
with
using
these
is
that
when
using
both
at
the
same
time
one
can
sometimes
cut
in
and
out
or
increase
in
volume
don
know
if
it
is
due
to
the
bluetooth
connection
or
something
else
the
second
is
if
using
one
at
time
you
can
only
use
one
of
the
skip
track
functions
ll
explain,
the
left
ear
bud
allows
the
user
to
repeat
song
or
go
back
to
previous
songs
the
right
ear
bud
skip
forward
to
the
next
song
on
ones
playlist
with
both
in
you
can
skip
forward
or
back
with
only
one
in
you
can
only
do
what
that
one
is
programmed
to
do
not
sure
if
this
is
function
that
could
be
changed
in
the
future,
but
if
so
it
would
make
these
head
phones
even
better
am
looking
at
purchasing
the
tozo
t0
to
compare
as
they
seem
to
be
the
closest
budget
but
good
head
phonesi
would
recommend
these
to
friend
the
headphones
are
awesome
they
re
super
easy
to
connect
with
your
phone
what
even
more
awesome
is
that
it
comes
with
carrying
bag
for
the
case
and
extra/different
sized
ear
tips
to
fit
smaller
or
bigger
ears
you
can
also
make
phone
calls
with
them
and
sound
really
clear
you
charge
them
in
the
case
and
it
comes
with
the
connection
to
charge
them
would
definitely
recommend
them
and
purchase
another
pair
for
the
price,
it
was
worth
try
bought
white
and
black
pair
for
my
gf
and
myself
she
uses
her
pretty
often,
no
longer
use
mine
as
the
right
bud
loses
consistently
looses
volume
or
doesn't
have
any
sound
at
all
the
touch
control
is
cool,
useful
and
easy
to
use
however
at
times
you'll
hang
up
call,
skip
tracks
etc
because
you
shoulder
brushed
up
against
the
bud
battery
is
decent
seemed
to
last
just
short
of
hours
and
then
back
in
the
case
the
case
does
stay
charged
for
very
long
time
was
able
to
get
lot
of
recharges
on
the
buds
and
only
need
to
recharge
the
case
every
or
days
there
was
coupon
for
free
one
in
one
of
the
boxes
purchased,
but
based
on
my
experience
with
it,
haven't
even
redeemed
it
hope
the
next
iteration
of
these
is
little
more
reliable,
because
for
few
more
bucks
you
can
get
pair
that
work
more
consistently
if
they
make
newer
version,
may
try
them
if
the
price
is
right
want
to
be
fair
the
head
phones
fit
ok
not
great
but
ok,
seem
little
bulky
in
the
ears
but
would
rather
that
then
have
them
fall
out
the
sound
quality
was
pretty
goodfor
$0
dollars,
thought
might
be
able
to
get
away
with
decent
set
of
headphones
that
can
do
number
of
activities
in
and
avoid
having
to
pay
out
the
top
end
dollars
they
almost
made
itthey
started
cutting
in
and
out
not
all
the
time,
but
was
walking
holding
my
are
at
my
waist,
with
my
phone
in
the
hand
specifically
the
right
handdid
not
occur
in
the
left
the
head
phones
would
cut
in
and
out
sometimes
to
many
people
the
very
occasional
cutouts
wouldn't
bother
them,
but
they
did
to
me
all
was
doing
was
walking
what
happens
if
have
them
in
while
i'm
on
my
motorcycle
or
my
road
bike
they
might
be
ok
for
someone
not
moving
lot
or
the
phone
is
on
the
left
side
of
their
body
more,
or
they
use
an
arm
band
in
the
end
just
didn't
want
to
have
to
remember
that
detailthe
case
was
little
bigger
than
other
brands
the
magnetic
holds
on
the
head
phones
are
nice
and
well
engineered
the
phone
charging
feature
is
neat
but
really
think
they
saved
money
in
manufacturing
by
buying
larger
batter,
and
then
adding
usb
charge
port
and
to
make
it
seem
more
on
purpose
instead
of
cost
reduction
have
battery
changers
alreadyrather
have
the
smaller
size
charger
for
just
the
headphonesthe
functionality
of
the
head
phones
where
you
change
volume
and
forward
in
music
works
near
flawlessly,
but
it
is
little
irritating
to
have
to
push
something
that
is
embedded
in
your
ear
little
harder
into
it
to
use
the
feature
not
deal
breaker
for
me
but
for
someoverall
it
was
solid
set
but
for
that
one
little
glitch,
however
i'm
sure
lot
of
people
will
find
these
perfect
for
their
needs
for
me
i'm
giving
another
brand
try
this
is
the
first
pair
of
earbuds
that
found
comfortable
and
that
work
well
right
out
the
box
they
were
easy
to
pair
with
my
iphone
after
having
bad
experiences
with
earbuds
in
the
past,
was
pleasantly
surprised
how
great
these
were
would
definitely
recommend
them
this
is
review
after
testing
these
for
little
over
month
long
story
short,
the
left
earbud
started
getting
quieter
and
quieter
the
volume
disparity
was
so
big
had
to
stop
using
them
out
of
fear
my
ears
would
get
messed
up
using
them
like
that
for
long
timei
don't
really
like
that
the
outside
is
touch
screen
hard
to
tell
when
the
button
is
pressed
without
any
haptic
feedbackbattery
life
is
pretty
bad
by
the
end
of
the
month,
it
would
maybe
last
almost
hours
on
full
charge
before
had
to
charge
it
againalso,
these
earbuds
are
kind
of
big
compared
to
some
other
cheaper
wireless
earbuds
if
they
look
big
in
the
picture
to
you,
it's
because
they
arei
would
pass
on
these
and
try
something
else
have
had
these
bluetooth
headphones
for
nearly
years
now
and
they
are
still
going
strong
use
them
almost
every
single
day
and
love
the
convenience
of
being
able
to
just
pop
them
back
into
their
carrying
case
to
charge
them
only
have
to
charge
the
case
itself
about
once
month
it
also
doubles
as
portable
battery
so
if
you
re
traveling
it
nice
to
know
you
have
back
upi
usually
just
wear
these
while
commuting
to
and
from
work,
but
ve
also
done
lots
of
running
and
working
out
with
them
and
they
never
budge
which
was
huge
issue
for
me
with
lots
of
previous
ear
buds
they
even
fit
well
under
and
helmet
while
snowboarding
and
never
seemed
to
be
affected
by
freezing
temperaturesi
waited
long
time
to
write
this
review,
but
now
you
can
know
that
these
will
withstand
the
test
of
time
highly
recommend
just
got
these
and
these
ear
buds
are
must
have
quality
packaging,
which
includes
earbuds,
charging
case,
usb
charging
cable,
assorted
rubber
ear
inserts
of
various
sizes
and
handy
storage
pouch
so
here
what's
up
these
things
rock,
sound
quality
is
really
good
and
after
trying
few
of
the
rubber
ear
inserts
and
finding
the
right
size,
these
earbuds
are
very
comfortable
so
here's
what's
really
awesome,
the
case
is
basically
battery,
so
you
can
charge
the
case
and
then
the
case
charges
the
earbuds
without
having
to
be
plugged
in
to
the
wall,
in
pinch
you
can
also
charge
your
phone
with
the
case
too,
yes
that's
right,
it's
emergency
power
for
your
phone
if
you
need
it
they've
thought
of
everything,
you
need
to
get
these
you
wont
be
disappointed
extremely
happy
with
the
earbuds
have
had
them
for
little
over
month
bought
them
primarily
for
running
and
bike
riding
biggest
concern
was
keeping
them
in
do
triathlons
and
am
aggressive
rider
and
heavy
with
my
feet
running
took
me
few
runs
to
get
the
right
size
ear
piece
found
out
needed
different
size
on
each
ear;
nice
they
they
came
with
selection
of
sizes
the
biggest
test
was
this
past
weekend
was
out
for
bike
ride
and
got
side
swiped
by
car
myself
and
bike
are
fine
but
it
didn
fare
to
well
for
the
brand
new
charger
ended
up
going
up
and
over
the
hood
of
the
car,
landed,
checked
my
self,
checked
the
bike,
both
fine,
and
then
realized
both
earbuds
were
still
in
my
ears
couldn
be
more
happy
fyi
no
complaints
on
the
sound,
connectivity
or
charging
the
touch
controls
could
be
better
but
do
everything
by
my
watch
anyways
never
bluetooth
headset
person
,so
decide
to
look
for
headphone
as
small
as
possible
so
can
secretly
wear
it
,this
bluetooth
headset
is
great
it
not
only
meets
my
requirement,
but
also
the
sound
quality
is
really
good,
and
the
waterproof
effect
really
like
this
earphone,
which
is
worth
buying
so
have
had
these
for
week
or
so
at
first,
was
pretty
happy
with
them
set
up
was
very
simple
and
straight
forward
quality
of
the
sound
good
sound
for
listening
to
my
music
used
them
for
quick
calls
and
had
absolutely
no
issues
with
me
hearing
or
the
person
on
the
other
line
hearing
me
but
those
were
very
quick
calls
no
more
than
min
max
also
used
these
on
runs
do
tend
to
sweat
and
didn
have
any
issue
while
running
love
the
little
bud
travel/charging
station
it
compact
and
protective
of
the
buds
from
packaging
to
sound
to
the
quality
and
durability
of
these
buds
they
are
pretty
good
but
then
had
very
long
conference
call
yesterday
after
having
had
nothing
but
great
experiences
using
these
buds,
this
conference
call
couldn
have
gone
worse
kept
getting
cut
off
the
call
and
having
to
dial
back
in
0x
phone
and
buds
were
completely
charged
with
full
service
the
sound
quality
wasn
an
issue
but
the
fact
that
the
buds
kept
disconnecting
me
from
the
call
missed
tons
of
important
info
and
discussions
that
was
very
frustrating
having
had
that
incident
will
continue
to
use
these
buds
but
for
no
more
than
wireless
music
buds
would
recommend
yes,
but
would
want
to
make
all
aware
of
the
issue
had
am
hoping
can
figure
out
what
the
issue
was
and
to
be
able
to
use
these
moving
forward
for
my
calls
these
earbuds
worked
way
better
than
expected
to
based
off
of
my
experience
with
wireless
have
been
trying
to
find
pair
that
would
actually
stay
in
my
ears
and
that
wouldn
have
to
constantly
mess
with
so
they
wouldn
fall
out
wore
these
on
long
run
and
never
needed
to
touch
them
even
when
you
don
have
music
playing,
it
still
has
great
noise
cancellation
and
the
quality
of
sound
is
great
these
buds
really
exceeded
my
expectations
like
all
other
reviewers,
i've
read
lots
of
review
on
wireless
earbud
on
amazon
to
find
out
the
one
with
reasonable
price
and
without
sacrificing
sound
quality
twsx0
by
pasonomi
is
the
one
pairing
to
my
iphone
was
piece
of
cake
both
earbuds
pair
with
my
phone
instantly
out
of
the
box
after
initial
blutooth
connection
you
can
control
basic
action
such
as
play
or
stop,
skip
forward
or
backward,
volume
up
and
down
by
touching
on
the
earbud
it
stays
firmly
at
my
ear
while
was
running
the
package
provides
pairs
of
eartip,
which
can
be
enough
to
various
ear
size
container
has
regular
usb
outlet
to
charge
phone
or
so
for
emergency
am
satisfied
with
overall
quality,
but
the
only
reason
why
gave
stars
is
that
bass
sound
is
not
great
compared
to
well
balanced
tremble
to
be
sure,
if
you
enjoys
regular
pop
music,
even
this
bass
sound
would
not
bother
you
much
originally
gave
these
two
stars
no
bass
and
very
tinny
sound
sent
them
back
and
the
company
sent
me
free
replacement
they
wanted
me
to
delete
the
bad
review
if
got
some
free
earbuds,
which
think
is
very
shady
got
the
replacements
and
said
would
give
them
more
in
depth
try
they
still
sounded
terrible
at
first
needed
the
largest
silicone
tips
that
they
provided
but
couldn
get
good
fit
and
still
the
sound
was
bad
had
an
idea
and
pulled
the
old
earbud
tips,
that
are
different
shape,
off
my
old
sony
wired
earbuds
what
difference
these
wireless
earbuds
transformed
into
great
sounding
and
secure
beasts
now
the
bass
is
there
and
the
fit
is
great
do
you
self
favor
and
buy
these
and
then
buy
package
of
more
full
sized
replacement
tips
for
under
$0
pasonomi
should
change
what
they
provided
but
even
having
to
buy
different
tips
from
day
one
makes
these
great
buy
just
deleted
my
earlier
review
of
this
the
earphones
arrived
today,
and
when
first
tried
them,
the
sound
quality
was
indeed
horrible
very
tiny,
thin,
no
bass
whatsoever
however,
after
placing
them
in
the
charger
for
few
hours
and
thinking
was
going
to
return
them,
tried
them
on
again,
and
with
different
size
of
ear
pads;
and
the
bass
actually
came
to
life
guess
it's
true,
earphones/headphones
have
to
be
broken
into
give
these
some
times,
few
hours
of
playing
to
get
the
audio
drivers
going,
and
the
audio
quality
becomes
little
above
average
love
music
and
definitely
wouldn't
go
as
far
as
to
say
that
the
sound
quality
is
excellent,
but
it's
getting
better
at
least
right
now
it's
pretty
good
maybe
next
week
it
will
reach
excellent
anyway,
sleek
look,
nice
charging
case
and
cool
touch
features
to
adjust
volume
and
change
tracks
these
earbuds
are
very
compact
and
detailed
in
every
aspect
of
the
product
they
have
their
own
storage
case,
charging
cord
and
of
course
different
sizes
of
ear
plugs
to
accommodate
any
size
ear
have
very
small
ears
and
found
size
to
fit
mine
the
bag
that
came
with
the
set
is
compact
enough
to
carry
in
your
purse/crossbody
bag
the
earbuds
are
self
changing
in
the
sturdy
plastic
case
that
they
rest
in,
you
don
need
batteries
because
they
are
conveniently
charged
by
usb
if
you
have
an
iphone
back
for
set
for
my
husband
these
will
not
disappoint
and
they
seem
like
they
will
last
for
awhile
they
are
okay
if
you
want
to
just
use
one,
you
can
only
use
the
left
one,
because
the
right
one
won't
connect
unless
they
are
both
out
somethings
they
fail
to
connect
and
have
to
take
them
out,
and
put
them
back
in
don't
like
that
cannot
skip
songs
or
turn
volume
up
and
down
with
them
but
for
basic
wireless
ear
bud,
they
are
okay
like
that
the
case
can
double
as
charger
for
your
phone
don't
hear
anything
when
have
them
in
and
am
listening
to
music,
however,
sometimes
when
am
doing
things,
the
right
will
come
in
and
out
use
these
headphones
on
regular
basis
at
the
gym
the
charge
last
around
four
hours
when
they
are
not
in
the
charging
box
charge
the
headphones
every
other
day
have
accidently
dropped
the
headphones
into
water
and
they've
worked
afterwards
do
struggle
with
getting
the
volume
to
turn
up
which,
i've
learned
after
while
that
you
have
to
hold
the
right
headphone
in
your
hand,
or
between
your
thumb
and
pointer
finger
until
the
headphones
tell
you
that
you
have
reached
max
volume
the
placement
of
the
headphone
in
your
hand
can
sometimes
be
tricky
due
to
the
sensitivity
of
the
headphones
overall,
love
these
headphones
and
refuse
to
go
to
the
gym
without
them
product
worked
well
the
first
weeks
then
right
headphone
lost
most
volume
now
they
wont
charge
correctly
so
half
the
time
put
them
in
and
they
are
dead
update:
seller
contacted
me
after
writing
this
review
to
offer
to
replace
the
earbuds
or
refund
thought
this
was
great
and
would
have
changed
the
review
and
stars
to
reflect
this
once
got
them
and
found
they
worked
however,
the
seller
refuses
to
do
so
until
fully
delete
this
review
if
you
are
relying
on
their
reviews
be
warned
that
they
are
doing

after
the
last

update
the
seller
refunded
my
money
listening
with
headphones
is
very
important
to
me
my
thought
process
when
buying
headphones
was
finding
something
cheap
while
having
decent
quality
of
sound,
all
while
taking
physical
beating
from
dropping
will
say
that
after
month
of
having
these
on
the
sound
is
phenomenal
for
its
0$
price
but,
that
does
not
mean
they
will
be
my
forever
headphonescons:after
about
minutes
of
use,
the

very

this
means:

wet,
don't

my
ears
every
morning
when
wake
up

constantly

microphone

people
have
said
to
me
that

muffled,
and
since
these
are
my
main
earbuds,
talking

been
big

when

they

that

have
come
to
believe
that
when
buying
product
it
is
important
to
buy
product
for
it's
intended
use,
do
not
buy
product
because
it
has
extra

gizmos
thrown
in
"a
jack
of
all
trades
is
master
of
none"
am
going
to
start
off
by
sayingif
you
receive
"winner"
card
from
this
company
they
will
not
honor
it
they
will
correspond
and
no
win
the
reason
for
the
stars
instead
of
five
honor
what
you
promote
with
that
being
said,
they
earbuds
work
great,
but
will
not
connect
to
apple
phones
we
have
kids
with
iphones
and
did
not
workhoweveri
have
an
android
and
love
them
they
fit
without
hurting
your
ears
and
do
not
fall
out
great
sound
quality
and
stay
charged
we
bought
for
all
of
the
kids
but
am
not
sending
the
back,
my
husband
and
are
keeping
them
for
ourselves
because
they
are
good
quality
was
incredibly
impressed
the
minute
put
these
earbuds
in
and
hit
play
on
my
phone
upon
opening
the
charging
case,
was
excited
to
see
that
the
earbuds
were
quite
bit
smaller
than
many
of
the
other
popular
brands
have
smaller
ears
so
many
of
the
earbuds
are
difficult
to
fit
into
my
ear
correctly,
and
they
fall
out
lot
have
custom
inears
that
were
over
$0,
and
not
only
are
these
much
more
comfortable,
but
the
sound
quality
can
give
my
custom's
run
for
their
money
have
not
been
able
to
find
out
how
many
driver's
these
earbuds
have,
but
the
sound
is
smooth
and
even
also
love
that
the
case
is
not
only
really
nice
charging
port
for
the
earbuds,
but
you
can
also
use
it
to
charge
your
cell
phone
according
to
the
info
on
the
earbuds,
the
case
is
good
for
two
full
charges
but
can't
verify
this
yet
as
haven't
needed
it
for
more
than
short
charge
it's
smaller
than
many
of
the
power
banks
that
we
carry
with
us,
so
this
has
freed
up
some
space
in
my
bag
the
case
is
nice,
small,
and
feels
like
it
will
hold
up
well
i'm
still
trying
to
work
through
controlling
the
volume
with
the
earbuds
themselves,
but
everything
else
is
incredibly
easy,
even
connecting
them
to
my
phone
also
like
that
they
state
information
like
that
they're
connected
once
you
have
them
set
in
your
ear
have
worn
these
to
the
gym
on
couple
of
occasions
now,
and
even
with
the
sweat,
there
has
been
no
issues,
and
they
don't
fall
out
with
movement
like
lot
of
the
earbuds
do
think
these
are
going
to
be
on
the
top
of
our
christmas
gift
list
this
year
they
price
is
great
compared
to
lot
of
other
brands,
and
you
can't
beat
the
fit
this
is
my
first
pair
of
bluetooth
earbuds
wanted
to
start
with
an
inexpensive
set
and
so
far,
they've
done
mostly
what
want
them
to
do
mainly
just
use
them
for
walking
my
dog/background
music
if
i'm
working
at
coffee
shop
like
the
tap
features
for
pause/play,
skipping
tracks,
etc
sound
quality
is
pretty
good
the
issue
i'm
having
with
them
is
that
my
phone
is
constantly
connecting
to
them
when
don't
want
it
to
will
turn
off
"x0"
in
my
bluetooth
menu,
select
the
device
actually
want
connected,
and
minute
later,
it
will
connect
back
to
x0
it's
extremely
frustratingaccording
to
other
people
know
with
bluetooth
earbuds
of
all
different
brands/types,
their
phones
will
not
connect
to
the
buds
while
they
are
in
their
case
this
makes
sense
and
would
be
ideal,
but
it's
not
happening
with
this
set
of
earphones
even
when
shut
into
the
case,
my
phone
randomly
connects
to
them
the
only
way
to
stop
this
from
happening
is
to
completely
unpair
them,
which
just
means
have
to
repair
them
every
time
want
to
use
them
just
an
annoying
inconvenience,
but
inconvenient
nonetheless
battery
life
is
ok
was
on
hour
flight
from
tampa
to
philly
and
they
gave
out
with
about
mins
to
go
they
recharged
quickly
in
the
case
though
and
was
ready
for
my
connecting
flight
the
sound
quality
is
ok
wish
that
they
went
just
little
louder
connect
them
to
my
iphone
xr
and
listen
to
my
music
while
flying
for
business
weekly
or
when
i'm
home
cutting
the
grass
noise
cancellation
is
impressive
can't
hear
my
mower
over
them
they
work
better
than
an
older
pair
of
beats
that
have
all
in
all
they
are
solid,
especially
at
onefourth
the
price
of
apple
ear
buds
the
buds
last
about
0hrs
and
they
don
take
long
to
charge
in
the
case
come
back
from
lunch
and
it
finished
charging
fully
charged
case
can
get
me
through
the
0hr
work
week
fine,
but
usually
only
use
one
earbud
at
time
sound
is
decent
comfortable
fit
mostly,
but
wearing
them
too
long
and
too
often
does
make
it
feel
bit
sore
only
used
for
calling
once
was
told
sounded
really
low
sound
is
decent
touch
control
isn't
too
great
pausing/playing
and
activating
voice
control
are
pretty
much
the
only
functions
that
work
right
when
using
the
buds
single
pairing
is
quick
lights
on
the
case
really
help
track
how
much
battery
is
left
package:
the
wireless
earbuds
come
in
nice
portable
case,
which
acts
as
both
carrying
case,
charging
station
for
the
earbuds,
and
its
own
charging
device
for
other
small
electronics
additionally,
there
is
small
usb
cord
that
can
be
used
to
charge
the
charging
case,
as
well
as
three
different
sizes
of
rubber
ear
pieces
one
thing
would
note
is
that
the
carrying
case
is
bit
bigger
than
other
models
that
i've
tested,
though
suspect
that
this
is
due
to
the
charging
capabilities
that
it
carries•
size/fit:
at
first
glance,
the
earbuds
may
look
bit
loose
fitting
due
to
the
lack
of
support
on
the
earpiece
itself
for
that
reason,
decided
to
use
larger
rubber
piece,
though
we
quickly
found
that
the
small
size
is
more
suitable
for
her
fortunately,
we
had
no
real
issues
with
the
fit
as
the
earbuds
fit
very
snugly
and
did
not
feel
loose
at
all
while
in
use
she
even
tested
these
during
light
run
on
the
treadmill,
and
to
our
pleasant
surprise,
the
earbud
did
not
feel
loose
at
all•
connectivity:
we
had
no
issues
connecting
the
earbuds
to
her
iphone
or
ipad
we
were
also
able
to
connect
these
to
my
desktop
at
home
similar
to
airpods,
the
earbuds
connect
automatically
when
you
remove
the
earbud
from
the
charging
case
this
is
small
nit,
but
when
the
left
or
right
earbud
connects
individually,
it
carries
the
same
name
as
the
other
earbud,
so
it
requires
an
additional
step
of
renaming
the
connection
to
differentiate
between
r/l•
sound
and
call
quality:
in
short,
we
were
blown
away
by
the
sound
quality,
as
it
is
rare
for
the
earbuds
to
have
such
solid
bass
this
holds
true
for
variety
of
music,
from
top
to
edm
likewise,
the
call
quality
was
crisp
and
ahead
of
other
similar
wireless
earbuds
that
we've
testedin
summary,
this
is
great
value
for
wireless
bluetooth
earbuds
that
also
doubles
as
its
own
portable
charging
device
the
sound
and
call
quality
were
stunning
at
this
price
point,
and
this
has
already
become
the
goto
listening
device
for
my
wife
highly
recommended
for
those
looking
for
new
earbuds
bought
truly
wireless
earbuds
to
compre
and
see
which
liked
the
best
got
the
pasonomi
these,
the
otium
soar,
the
rademax
truly
wireless
in
ear
headphones,
and
the
kahe
wireless
earbudsseeing
as
always
working
out
just
wanted
to
test
few
things
most
important
is
how
do
these
sound
out
of
all
of
them
the
pasonomi
had
the
clearest
sound
but
the
otium
soar
were
the
only
earbuds
with
nice
bass
even
better
than
the
otium
wireless
earbuds
next
was
seeing
how
far
away
can
go
with
these
earbuds
they
all
started
to
cut
off
after
about
0m
so
moved
onto
noise
cancelling
capability
entered
semi
noisy
lounge,
kids
were
studying
in
big
groups
the
otium
soar
and
the
pasonomi
were
definitely
the
best
but
otium
soar
earbuds
fit
more
snuggly
so
the
otium
won
for
moose
cancelling
did
try
the
pasonomi
with
other
earbuds
had
and
the
noise
canceling
and
overall
sound
was
betterafter
seeing
these
results
definitely
decided
on
otium
soar
and
pasonomi
in
the
end
kept
both
really
like
the
otium
soar
because
they
fit
so
nice
and
feel
great
when
working
out,
but
can
wear
them
all
day
since
they
will
die
after
about
hours
and
then
if
accidentally
put
one
earbud
wrong
inside
the
charging
case,
end
up
only
charging
one
earbud
and
then
can
use
both
so
kept
both
because
can
switch
them
when
they
are
charging
also
the
otium
soar
can
only
charge
the
earbuds
up
to
times
believe
and
the
pasonomi
can
charge
up
to
times
plus
can
charge
my
phone
which
is
greatalso,
if
the
four
earbuds
tried
out,
otium
soar
and
pasonomi
were
the
most
aesthetically
pleasing
when
placed
in
my
ear
so
there
thatalso,
the
pasonomi
are
nice
because
you
can
just
touch
the
earbud
to
control
music
etc
and
otium
soar
you
have
to
press
the
earbud
controls
instead
this
is
why
like
otium
soar
during
workouts
because
not
accidentally
touching
the
earbud
controls
but
then
during
other
parts
of
the
day,
pasonomi
is
nice
because
just
have
to
swiftly
touch
the
earbud,
it
takes
lot
less
effortthere
many
pros,
few
possible
cons
it
up
to
you
to
decide
if
they
re
worth
it
think
they
are
so
purchased
these
wireless
ear
buds
not
really
knowing
what
to
expect
as
don
really
use
lot
of
them
because
they
hurt
my
ears
do
have
to
say
was
pleasantly
surprised
that
these
are
quite
comfortable
and
stay
in
the
directions
were
sort
of
hard
to
follow
due
to
the
language
barrier
but
was
still
able
to
figure
it
out
was
able
to
sync
these
with
my
iphone
xr
without
any
issue
at
all
did
try
making
few
phone
calls
with
these
ear
buds
and
had
no
problems
but
not
sure
that
these
are
something
would
use
every
day
if
had
to
make
continuous
calls
as
the
hearing
was
little
difficult
at
times
do
like
that
the
little
charging
case
is
magnetic
find
that
super
helpful
and
they
do
tend
to
hold
charge
for
quite
long
timemy
great
niece
who
is
used
these
for
hours
playing
games
on
her
phone
and
watching
youtube
stuff
and
she
had
no
issues
with
them
and
she
actually
she
told
me
that
she
really
liked
them
and
wanted
them
would
definitely
recommend
these
as
really
affordable
wireless
bluetooth
earbuds
the
sound
quality
overall
is
very
good
and
the
ear
buds
are
super
comfortable
it
so
nice
to
not
have
to
worry
about
cords
getting
in
the
way
and
being
able
to
move
freely
the
magnetic
case
is
really
awesome,
they
charge
really
quickly
and
hold
charge
for
long
time
let
start
with
some
background
wanted
to
have
earbuds
for
my
workout
session
something
small
and
that
would
fit
perfectly
in
the
ear
and
not
very
pricy
like
airpods
oh
boy,
did
get
what
wantedthe
build
quality
is
really
good
doesn
feel
cheap
at
all
the
charging
case
is
well
built
as
well
and
is
easy
to
carry
in
the
pocket
or
any
small
bag
the
dedicated
button
to
show
battery
is
additional
feature
imolet
talk
about
sound
quality
given
the
price
range,
think
it
is
above
par
wouldn
say
it
compares
with
$0
bose
earbuds
but
it
provides
really
good
base
and
noise
cancellation
the
extra
ear
buds
came
in
handy
coz
have
lil
small
ear
and
need
smaller
budsi
also
liked
the
water
resistant
am
sweaty
guy
when
it
comes
to
the
gym
this
thing
held
up
to
its
reputation
in
terms
of
that
as
well
kudos
to
the
manufacturersoverall,
it
really
great
product
and
definitely
bang
for
you
buck
not
to
mention,
it
is
damn
fancy
to
look
at
was
looking
for
wireless
bluetooth
headphones
specifically
for
working
out
at
the
gym
after
two
weeks
of
use,
these
headphones
have
been
fantastic
the
sound
quality
is
excellent,
love
the
little
charging
case,
and
they
stay
in
my
ear
during
my
weight
routines
and
ab
workouts
i've
had
some
issues
with
music
pauses
and
breaking
up,
but
am
fairly
certain
that
is
from
poor
wifi
signal
listen
to
online
streaming
music
mostly
as
had
that
with
my
last
headphones
overall
very
happy
with
this
purchase
easy
set
up,
perfect
fit
without
fail
straight
out
of
the
box
without
charging
it
lasted
several
hours,
thereafter
it
charges
quickly
excellent
noise
quality
and
have
also
used
to
talk
with
on
the
phone
after
about
two
days
of
using
to
talk
on
the
phone
i've
begun
to
encounter
some
malfunction
with
partner
stating
my
voice
has
begun
to
sound
mumbled
or
robotic
this
could
be
connection
issue
or
perhaps
from
overuse
as
had
used
it
almost
constantlywill
update
with
more
info
and
any
changes
if
they
occur
if
you
need
quality
that
doesn't
break
the
bank,
this
is
your
earbuds
the
charge
lasts
long
and
they
recharge
full
every
time
you
put
them
in
the
charging
case
use
to
work
out
daily
and
go
at
least
weeks
without
needing
to
recharge
the
charging
case
they
fit
perfectly
in
your
ear
they
stay
put
the
sound
quality
is
good
for
those
heavy
sweat
workouts,
would
recommend
making
sure
you
clean
off
the
little
screen
to
be
sure
to
get
best
sound
quality
have
used
earbuds
that
were
0x
the
cost
and
these
are
better
buy
with
confidence
and
if
you
have
an
issue,
their
customer
service
will
respond
quickly
and
take
care
of
your
needs
so
these
are
awesome
for
only
bucks
you
get
headphones
you
can
workout,
wear
in
the
shower
and
are
comfortable
to
wear
all
day
think
the
ear
buds
tips
that
come
with
these
are
way
to
small
only
tiny
ear
wholes
would
fit
but
they
can
easily
be
changed
for
some
other
ones
from
other
ear
phones
they
connect
super
easy
you
just
take
the
out
of
the
case
and
they
connect
fast
to
top
it
off
it
has
mamp
battery
charger
which
is
great
for
when
i'm
out
all
day
usually
have
my
headphones
with
me
and
they
rarely
need
charge
so
it's
perfect
use
the
battery
for
my
phone
more
than
the
headphone
you
won't
be
disappointed
love
love
love
these
earbuds
have
had
them
for
about
months
now
and
wear
them
every
day
at
work
the
battery
life
is
great,
sound
quality
is
amazing
i've
yet
to
have
to
turn
the
volume
all
the
way
up
on
them,
and
fit
is
very
comfortable
in
my
ear
my
mom
and
fiance
ended
up
purchasing
pair
as
well
and
love
them
almost
all
of
my
coworkers
have
purchased
them
too
seriously
could
not
have
gotten
better
pair
of
earbuds
for
the
price
0%
recommend
originally
had
moderate
expectations
of
these
headphones
and
didn't
think
that
they
would
impress
me
but
was
wrong
these
are
awesome
headphones
that
pair
with
your
phone
quickly,
and
easily
instructions
are
simple
my
first
use
was
actually
to
take
them
on
run,
which
thought
would
go
poorly
since
they
just
sit
inside
your
ear
expected
them
to
be
falling
out
as
pounded
the
pavement
for
few
miles
however,
these
sat
in
my
ear
securely,
not
once
jiggling
free,
and
actually
were
more
comfortable
than
my
previous
pair
of
bluetooth
headphones
battery
life
seems
to
be
more
than
sufficient
and
the
carrying
case
doubles
as
charger/battery
pack
which
is
really
neat
and
useful
wouldn't
hesitate
to
recommend
these
and
will
likely
buy
second
pair
for
my
wife
soon
easy
to
connect
to
my
phone
battery
life
was
about
hrs
of
play
some
headphones
out
there
require
you
to
sync
and
use
both
buds
at
the
same
time,
and
these
you
can
use
independently
one
charges
while
you
use
the
otherhoweverif
you
are
looking
to
use
these
for
phone
calls,
advise
you
to
go
with
type
of
ear
piece
that
does
not
have
the
mic
in
your
ear
was
told
that
at
times
sounded
muffled
or
'in
cave',
and
it
was
hard
to
clearly
hear
me,
even
with
no
surrounding
noise
pollution
when
using
these
for
phone
call
ended
up
buying
separate
headset
piece
for
phone
callsbut
if
you
are
searching
for
decent
buds
for
music,
these
will
do
great
read
some
negative
reviews
so
was
little
worried,
but
they
sound
good
and
immediately
paired
easy
to
use,
nice
packaging,
and
came
with
carry
pouch
the
earbuds
that
came
with
aren't
too
great
though
overall:

for

have
said

on
my
side
or
their
sidepeople
have
hard
time
hearing
me
bought
these
earbuds
months
ago
and
have
been
loving
them
ever
sense
they
pair
to
my
iphone
very
easily
and
have
pretty
good
sound
and
battery
life
overall
would
totally
recommend
these
for
how
much
they
cost
but
there
are
few
things
that
aren
my
favorite
first
off
when
bought
them
was
super
excited
to
see
that
they
were
water
prof,
but
as
it
turned
out
they
weren
as
water
prof
as
they
had
made
them
out
to
be
one
night
was
sitting
down
listening
to
music
and
drinking
water
when
decided
to
take
one
earbud
out,
and
because
so
clumsy
accidentally
dropped
on
earbud
into
my
glass
of
water
it
must
have
been
in
the
water
for
seconds
before
got
it
out,
but
ever
sense
that
happened
that
earbud
has
little
to
no
audio
ever
now
for
dollar
ear
buds
it
pretty
great
that
they
at
least
have
some
sort
of
water
protection
but
wouldn
trust
the
waterproofing
of
these
for
more
than
just
rain
or
sweat
the
other
complaint
have
about
these
earbuds
is
they
have
zero
bass,
even
when
playing
song
with
really
heavy
bass
you
won
get
anything
about
of
these
things
now
don
need
bass
in
my
music
so
it
not
huge
deal
for
me
but
if
you
really
like
bass
wouldn
recommend
these
to
you
other
than
these
two
problems
really
enjoy
theses
headphones
and
would
recommend
them
to
anyone
looking
for
cheap
pair
of
earbuds
straight
out
of
the
box
the
earbuds
looked
great
the
instructions
were
simple
and
easy
to
followthe
bluetooth
paired
easily
with
my
galaxy
s0
worked
surprisingly
well
for
calls,
even
when
my
phone
was
floors
belowthe
sound
quality
watching
movies
was
as
good
as
had
hoped
forthe
only
issue
had
was
the
touch
functions
play/pause
or
answer/end
call
was
great
the
volume
was
good,
but
the
up
is
controlled
by
the
right
bud
and
down
by
the
left,
which
is
fine
unless
you
like
to
wear
only
one
bud
the
more
complex
controls
were
little
more
delicate
to
useif
you
are
going
to
always
wear
both
and
just
need
to
ansqer/end
or
pause/play
then
these
are
awesome
finally
got
bluetooth
earbuds
after
procrastinating
and
i'm
glad
got
these
sound
quality
is
excellent,
noise
cancellation
is
great,
battery
life
is
great
they
are
really
comfortable
and
don't
fall
out
cannot
use
apple
earbuds
as
they
always
would
fall
out
settled
for
skull
candy
for
years
because
they
fit
in
my
ears
well
my
current
phone,
google
pixel
xl
requires
bluetooth
headphones
and
dragged
my
feet
getting
them
since
the
phone
came
with
little
adapter
that
made
my
old
standard
earbuds
useable,
usually
well,
necessity
required
me
to
finally
get
new
ones
and
i'm
kicking
myself
for
not
doing
this
sooner
these
are
great
only
use
them
for
music,
both
while
stationary
and
on
an
elliptical
and
have
no
problems
with
them
slipping
i've
walked
away
from
my
phone
and
the
range
is
pretty
good,
i've
gone
about
feet
before
they
cut
out
those
around
me
say
they
cannot
hear
my
music
so
that's
also
good
to
know
because
who
wants
to
be
that
jerk
on
the
plane
whose
sound
is
trickling
out
of
their
headphones
definitely
recommend
0/0/0
so
just
received
these
today
and
will
keep
an
update
every
week
was
nervous
about
spending
bucks
for
some
bluetooth
earbuds
and
can
almost
guarantee
you
will
be
more
than
happy
with
this
purchase
the
most
hard
headed
pickiest
person
you
can
imagine
but
damn
blown
away
with
these
so
far
the
touch
commands
on
theses
are
freaking
awesome
will
take
time
getting
use
too
but
wow
hope
my
these
last
will
post
again
in
week
thank
you
to
this
source
you
did
an
amazing
job
with
these
can
write
page
on
all
the
light
features
so
thankful
you
guys
were
able
to
put
all
together
for
under
bucks
is
just
nuts
would
of
paid
more
if
would
of
seen
them
in
store
congratulations
on
your
product
will
tel
friends
about
you
bought
these
in
march
it
is
june
now
wanted
to
give
them
good
working
over
before
did
review
ok,so
far
they
have
held
up
very
well
and
for
the
price
there
hard
to
beat
sound
quality
good
the
battery
life
is
good
for
long
workouts
usually
get
about
hrs
out
of
them
before
they
die
the
water
proofing
works
well
the
charger,
can
go
weeks
most
times
before
have
to
recharge
it
so
about
to
chargesproblems
foundear
buds
need
more
sizes
for
fitmentcontacts
for
charging
need
to
be
cleaned
every
few
days
or
they
will
not
chargewhen
you
recharge
the
charger
you
need
to
keep
an
eye
on
it
mine
does
and
doesn't
cut
off
when
its
finished
charging
over
all
so
far
they
have
worked
well
and
in
my
opinion
worth
the
money
will
up
date
when
wear
them
out
great
device
our
first
set
of
bluetooth
earbuds,
so
can't
compare
it
with
other
brands
this
brand
works
well
and
does
great
job
if
you
have
the
wrong
size
earbuds
on,
these
will
fall
out,
so
be
sure
to
use
the
correct
size
for
your
ear
as
long
as
you
follow
the
instructions,
you
should
have
no
problem
pairing
am
satisfied
with
the
sound
quality
and
volume*update:
this
was
gift
for
my
girlfriend,
and
she
accidentally
spilled
water
on
the
charging
box
the
charging
box
no
longer
held
charge,
but
it
still
provided
charge
for
the
earbuds
contacted
customer
service
and
explained
the
situation
they
immediately
replied
and
sent
replacement
charging
box,
free
of
charge
am
very
happy
and
satisfied
with
the
product
and
especially
the
customer
service
would
definitely
buy
from
pasonomi
again
after
one
and
half
years
of
owning
these,
can
say
that
they're
pretty
amazing
for
their
pricesound,
build
quality,
and
overall
performance
hasn't
degraded
bit,
maybe
except
for
the
cover
popping
offthankfully,
it
still
sandwiches
into
place
well
and
protects
the
earbudsi
guess
my
only
complaint
would
be
the
cover
not
shielding
my
eyes
from
the
blinding
charging
light
at
night,
but
then
remember
that
only
paid
like
$0
for
it
and
flip
it
over
so
far
used
them
for
day
and
they
re
great
buy
these
are
for
loud
listening
and
my
loud
job,
and
my
airpods
are
for
more
quieter
environments
they
fit
great
in
my
ears,
don
fall
out
need
them
to
be
discreet,
which
they
are
if
wearing
hoodie
or
beanie
and
they
muff
out
lot
of
outside
noise
too
only
thing
is
you
have
to
make
sure
they
re
in
properly
or
they
won
turn
off
sometimes
just
throw
them
in
the
case,
but
they
don
connect
fully
so
it
still
shows
they
re
on
on
my
phone
buy
before
they
realize
what
they
re
selling
and
up
the
prices
wasn't
sure
what
to
expect
with
these
bluetooth
earbuds
because
haven't
ever
tried
wireless
ones
these
are
game
changer
for
my
workouts
for
sure
the
sound
quality
is
super
clear
walked
far
away
from
my
phone
as
cleaned
my
house
and
didn't
lose
connection
even
once
the
volume
is
easy
to
turn
up
and
down
with
tap
of
either
ear
bud
love
that
the
touch
functions
make
it
easy
to
control
what
songs
you
listen
to
to
switch
to
different
genre
or
album,
the
siri
function
works
great
was
even
able
to
check
the
weather
through
siri
without
my
phone
nearby
the
battery
lasts
super
long
and
is
easy
to
charge
with
the
charging
case
when
the
battery
power
is
low,
the
is
voice
warning
through
the
earbuds
so
they
can
be
popped
into
the
case
for
charge
the
case
is
also
excellent
to
use
as
an
extra
source
of
power
for
phones
and
other
devices
the
fit
of
the
buds
is
super
comfortable
and
snug,
so
the
buds
do
not
fall
out
when
running
or
doing
other
workouts
overall,
these
earbuds
are
perfect
these
are
very
comfortable
earphones
once
changed
out
the
silicone
tips
have
medium
ears
and
the
main
part
of
the
ear
plug
fits
well
in
my
ear
asked
my
friend
who
has
small
ears
to
try
them
on
and
she
could
not
fit
them
in
properly
as
the
bulk
of
the
earphone
was
hanging
out
of
her
ear
have
been
using
these
to
listen
to
music
while
riding
my
motorcycle
and
love
them
they
fit
well
under
my
helmet
and
stay
in
the
phone
charger
and
single
bud
use
are
great
features
as
well
the
only
issue
is
due
to
the
fact
that
ride
my
motorcycle
with
these,
it
was
disappointing
that
had
to
take
the
charger
box
with
me
to
reactivate
power
to
the
buds
after
disconnecting
from
them
to
keep
using
them
overall
these
are
great
and
would
definitely
recommendpros:great

the

really

only

of
them
so
can
hear
what's
going
on
around
me
when
am
running
or
at
the
gym
yesterday
they
stopped
working,
but
contacted
the
seller
when
realized
they
were
still
under
warranty
hope
to
hear
from
them
soon
so
can
enjoy
them
again
they
keep
me
sane
at
work
would
definitely
buy
them
for
my
friends
and
family
if
the
seller
honors
the
warranty
we
will
see
these
were
really
great

0/0/0,
the

they've
had
an

at
work,
never
traveled
with
them,
never
ran
with
them,
etc
they
were
good
while
they
lasted,
but
not
sure
if
it
was
worth
$0
for

of
usei
bought
similar
pair
of
trayna
earbuds,
soley
to
keep
in
my
gym
bag,
in
july
those
were
only
$0,
and
seem
to
be
higher
quality
hoping
those
last
well
would
recommend
the
trayna
earbuds
over
these,
although
have
not
owned
them
as
long

there's
not

as
advertised
for

advertised
and
that
failed
in

will

good

persuaded
me
to
keep
it
while
these
are
certainly
not
the
best
in
the
market,
they
are
the
best
in
this
price
range
had
small
manufacturing
issue
with
my
first
order
which
was
quickly
replaced
for
free
they
fit
well
with
medium
to
large
ears,
though
my
girlfriend
cannot
fit
them
in
her
ear
at
all
as
they
are
simply
too
big
to
get
positioned
within
her
antihelixdecent
sound
quality,
very
good
connection,
and
accurate
description
of

lifenote
that
you
must
always
use
the

earpiece,
so
you
cannot
double
the
battery

using
full

then
rightedit:this
was
paid
review,
offering
the
product
for
free
upon
writing
five
star
review
have
now
changed
it
to
these
are
actually
very
good
for
the
price,
however
their
sound
quality
isn't
great
its
bass
is
weak
and
it
isn't
the
best
connection
they
also
give
me
horrible
headache
to
wear
for
an
extended
period
of
timealso,
if
you
play
vr
then
these
will
probably
give
you
horrible
motion
sickness
to
use
while
in
vr
have
never
had
problems
before
with
motion
sickness
in
vr
before,
but
just
minutes
after
putting
these
in
with
it
had
to
quit
one
wordlove
so
happy
with
these
ear
buds
almost
went
out
and
spent
over
$0
on
similar
product
great
quality
sound
is
good
the
price
is
the
best
part
will
be
buying
these
for
christmas
presents
for
sure
the
volume
has
gradually
reduced
over
the
months
at
full
volume
the
sound
is
ok
at
best
just
concerned
that
the
current
trend
will
prove
to
be
the
death
nail
for
the
ear
buds
occasionally
have
to
unpair
and
re
pair
to
my
device
due
to
the
cutting
in
an
out
of
sound
bit
annoying
***update***
star
review
revised
the
company
unprompted
refunded
the
entire
purchase
price
and
shipped
new
pair
fantastic
customer
service
hopeful
that
the
first
pair
was
an
unfortunate
defect
bought
these
for
birthday
gift
for
my
husband
he
needed
something
totally
wireless
for
doing
yard
work
and
running
and
he
loves
them
just
like
other
reviews
say,
you
do
need
to
use
the
correct
ear
pillow
size
to
customize
the
sound
the
music
balance
quality
is
very
good
and
they
really
are
sweatproof
they
don't
slip
around
or
fall
out
the
battery
life
is
also
as
promised;
he
gets
several
hours
of
audio
time
bonus:
they
came
fully
charged
right
out
of
the
box
so
he
didn't
have
to
wait
to
use
them
ve
hardly
used
these
because
bought
them
for
outside
and
had
trouble
keeping
them
in
my
ears
but
that
not
the
problemthe
problem
is
that
wanted
to
try
them
again
just
for
inside
use
and
when
tried
charging
the
box/power
bank,
no
lights
ve
tried
variations
of
different
cords,
plug
in
ports,
and
different
home
outlets
and
even
charging
overnight
and
still
no
lightsthe
window
to
contact
seller
is
closed,
so
can
contact
company
through
amazoni
hoping
they
will
see
this
message
and
contact
me
feeling
should
have
just
spent
$0
on
regular
bluetooth
earbuds
instead
of
$0
for
these
did
not
want
to
buy
the
ugly
apple
pods
sticking
out
of
my
ears,
so
tried
these
they
are
pretty
good
they
connect
well
to
my
watch
and
iphone
sometimes
when
you
ignore
them
on
devise
they
can
not
find
them
again
and
occasionally
one
will
loose
connection
all
in
all,
run
with
them
and
they
worked
well
also
talked
on
the
phone
with
them
and
the
other
people
say
they
can
hear
me
well
am
giving
my
pair
to
my
brother
and
buying
another
pair
sound
is
ok
they
are
not
bose
speakers
of
course
but
they
do
they
job
for
good
price
my
first
impression
when
got
them
on
right
out
of
the
box
was
that
they
sounded
very
tin
ny
could
hear
the
bass
very
well
no
biggie,
had
not
sized
them
yet
tried
various
tip
combination
till
got
what
felt
was
good
fit
now
was
ready
to
hit
the
gym
have
to
say,
they
sounded
very
good
once
had
them
perfectly
positioned
in
my
ears
bass
was
good
highs
where
clear
unfortunately,
they
didn
stay
that
way
found
myself
continuously
adjusting
them
would
get
them
just
right
and
if
needed
to
pause
or
skip
to
the
next
song,
would
screw
up
my
perfect
fit
by
pressing
the
button
which
distracted
me
from
my
routing
also,
when
tried
to
adjust
them
somehow
managed
to
hit
the
buttons
and
kept
pausing
the
song
all
in
all,
they
are
not
bad
it
just
didn
work
for
me
think
they
would
be
great
if
was
just
sitting
around
listening
to
music
so,
had
to
return
them
one
thing
must
say,
returning
them
to
amazon
was
simple
and
easy
what
like:
physical
design
and
craftsmanship
are
excellent
they
fit
and
stay
in
my
ears
very
well
and
don't
cause
any
discomfort
over
time
when
use
them
to
talk
on
the
phone,
people
report
that
they
can't
tell
i'm
using
them
sound
quality
is
great
for
the
recipient
of
the
call
the
battery
life
of
the
charging
base
is
great
it
lasts
for
many
charges
of
the
ear
buds
the
design
of
the
case
is
great
and
it
is
really
well
builtwhat
dislike:
very
little
bass
when
listening
to
music
brings
the
sound
quality
rating
down
gave
it
stars
battery
life
with
continuous
use
for
music
listening
with
volume
at
about
0/0
max
is
around
hours
not
terrible
but
would
prefer
they
last
longer
the
tap
controls
can
be
little
clumsy
to
useoverall
really
do
like
these
and
no
regrets
on
the
purchase
they
are
good
value
when
considering
the
feature
set
and
performance
vs
cost
they
are
so
convenient
to
use
for
toggling
between
phone
and
music
when
i'm
working
or
on
the
run
i'm
looking
forward
to
having
these
for
traveling
my
score
is
mainly
due
to
the
sound
quality,
which
could
be
improvedafter
wrote
this
original
review,
the
manufacturer
contacted
me
to
issue
full
refund
without
returning
the
product
and
ship
me
new
set
as
well
the
new
set
performs
the
same
but
really
impressed
with
their
customer
service
i've
had
these
for
less
than
year,
and
my
experience
has
been
mostly
frustration
they're
not
to
blame
for
bluetooth
being
garbage
technology,
but
they
don't
bring
much
to
the
table
when
have
them
paired
to
both
my
chromebook
and
android
phone,
they
will
only
work
with
the
phone
until
force
forget
the
device,
even
if
try
to
manually
pair
with
the
chromebook
they
will
periodically
cut
out
and
lose
connection
to
the
device,
and
have
to
repair
the
sound
is
often
low
when
first
put
them
in
my
ears,
and
have
to
put
the
buds
back
in
the
charger,
and
go
through
the
process
again
before
they'll
be
at
listenable
volume
sometimes
this
takes
multiple
tries
the
documentation
is
incomplete
and
confusing,
and
does
not
as
far
as
could
decipher
include
key
for
the
meanings
of
the
various
blue/red
light
combinations
yesterday,
they
stopped
working
altogether,
despite
having
light
activity
on
the
budsthese
are
not
worth
the
money;
if
had
known
what
was
in
store
when
bought
them,
would
have
just
skipped
the
purchase
nice
set
of
wireless
earbuds
at
this
price
point
easy
to
bluetooth
to
my
samsung
galaxy
0s
good
sound
and
very
comfortable
nice
charge
case
and
you
can
even
charge
your
phone
with
it
touch
adjustment
on
earbuds
to
adjust
volume,
next
track
and
answer
phone
call
when
listening
to
music,
personally
can't
here
surroundings
so
would
consider
that
noise
cancellation
also
the
earbuds
come
with
several
different
ear
tips,
make
sure
to
find
the
size
that
fits
your
ears
snugly
because
this
makes
difference
in
the
sound
quality
overall,
very
nice
and
would
recommend
these
these
head
phones
are
great
for
their
price
sound
quality
was
good
and
they
were
perfect
for
working
out
ear
buds
fit
nice,
changing
the
song
forward
or
back
with
double
tap
of
the
ear
bud
was
easy
and
convenient
the
only
problem
ran
across
was
the
right
ear
bud
did
have
problems
keeping
connected
to
my
phone
when
took
them
out
on
run
the
left
ear
bud
stayed
connected
the
whole
time
ve
had
these
since
aug
but
only
recently
tried
them
out
can
believe
waited
this
long
the
sound
quality
is
great
and
the
fit
is
quite
comfortable
in
my
ear
won
use
these
for
calls,
but
instead
long
trips
on
planes
think
these
will
be
perfect
for
traveling
around
as
the
case
is
small
enough
to
keep
in
my
purse
and
it
won
add
too
much
extra
weight
to
be
worried
about
lugging
them
around
appreciate
that
you
get
warning
when
there
low
battery
for
the
price,
there
no
need
to
speed
the
extra
on
pricey
fruit
brand
was
really
impressed
at
first;
the
sound
quality
was
good,
the
batteries
lasted
about
hours
and
charged
really
quickly
did
have
really
hard
time
keeping
them
in
my
ear,
tried
all
the
earpiece
sizes
but
have
trouble
with
all
headphones
that
go
in
your
ear
so
think
its
just
mei
have
not
used
them
very
much
because
of
the
before
mentioned
falling
out
problem
now
all
of
sudden
they
are
starting
to
connect
to
my
phone
while
they
are
in
the
charging
case
have
to
either
turn
off
the
bluetooth
on
my
phone
or
tell
my
phone
to
forget
the
headphonesi
would
return
them
but
am
outside
my
return
window
with
amazon
:
this
has
been
one
of
the
best
things
have
purchased
this
year
have
had
many
headphones
in
the
past
but
the
style,
quality
and
customer
service
have
blown
me
away
recently
had
the
earbuds
stolen
from
the
charging
case
while
was
at
work
and
the
manufacturer
graciously
sent
me
new
earbuds0
the
design
and
fit
of
the
earbuds
is
wonderful
and
sleek
and
not
at
all
bulky
they
came
with
many
different
size
tips
ensuring
that
they
fit
snug
in
all
ear
sizes0
pairing
was
very
fast
and
super
easy
especially
loved
being
able
to
use
one
earbud
at
time
if
listen
to
music
at
work,
need
to
be
able
to
have
one
free
ear
to
be
able
to
communicate
and
these
earbuds
have
made
it
so
easy
to
use
one
without
the
hassle
of
having
both
outside
the
case0
the
charging
case
and
earbud
battery
life
is
outstanding
recently
had
to
get
rid
of
different
pair
of
bluetooth
headphones
that
only
lasted
about
minutes
with
these,
never
have
to
worry
about
whether
they
are
charged
and
the
case
itself
stays
charged
long
time0
the
sound
quality
stands
up
to
the
more
well
known
brands
you
will
not
be
disappointed
with
the
great
quality
of
this
product0
know
many
have
said
these
are
not
good
for
phone
calls
but
this
did
not
deter
me
since
bought
them
with
the
intention
of
only
using
them
to
listen
to
musicoverall,
cannot
say
enough
positives
about
this
product
am
so
happy
that
did
not
need
to
attempt
to
find
replacement
once
mine
were
stolen
definitely
recommend
these
earbuds
and
can
thank
pasonomi
enough
for
their
outstanding
product
the
quality
is
decent,
the
controls
are
alright,
the
sound
quality
is
good,
the
battery
life
is
fine,
the
microphone
works,
and
they're
comfortable
enough
to
wear
for
an
hour
or
twoi
really
don't
have
any
issues
with
these
considering
the
price,
but
think
in
the
future
i'd
just
spend
more
and
get
nicer
pair
or
bluetooth
earbudsupdate:
occasionally
they
inexplicably
drop
their
connection
and
then
attempt
to
reconnect,
but
can't
until
they're
powered
off
and
back
on
in
the
carrying
case
am
so
happy
purchased
these
bluetooth
comparable
wireless
headphones
over
any
other
received
them
quickly,
and
was
very
pleased
with
the
sound
quality
and
comfort
my
biggest
concern
was
that
they
wouldn
be
comfortable
or
would
not
fit
in
my
ear,
that
was
not
the
case
they
are
perfect
hoping
to
get
pair
for
my
son
and
husband
for
father
day
was
surprised
to
find
the
charging
base
fully
charged
upon
arrival
love
these
things
so
much
don
want
to
take
them
off
there
was
different
size
earpieces,
so
after
found
the
ones
that
fit
hardly
noticed
was
wearing
them,
except
the
great
sound
they
produce
it
comes
with
nice
carrying
case,
but
make
sure
you
keep
the
manual
in
it
because
it
has
important
instructions
about
how
to
reset
the
headphones
and
has
details
about
what
each
indicator
light
means
they
resemble
spaceship
in
their
case
the
technology
definitely
seems
space
age
amazing
value
too
let
me
just
start
by
saying
i've
had
countless
headphones
and
earbuds
over
the
past
few
years
i'm
marathon
runner
so
comfort
and
reliability
are
vital
to
me
long
battery
life
is
essential
as
welli
purchased
these
only
few
days
ago
and
just
finished
quick
mile
run
it
was
hot
and
extremely
humid
so,
needless
to
say
sweated,
lot
this
was
the
perfect
test
for
these
earbuds
because
wondered
if
they
would
begin
to
slip
or
even
fall
out
when
they
started
to
get
sweatybut
am
happy
to
report
they
never
moved
no
issues
with
the
touch
pads
either,
even
with
sweaty
handsit's
been
along
time
since
i've
had
pair
of
earbuds
or
headphones
that
just
sort
of
disappeared
and
allowed
me
to
focus
solely
on
my
runof
course
this
was
only
my
first
impressions
so
cant
comment
on
longevity
or
battery
life
just
yetsounds
quality
was
fine,
not
amazing
but
that's
not
the
reason
bought
theseall
in
all
i'm
very
please
so
far
will
follow
up
on
my
review
at
the
end
of
my
running
season
was
iffy
on
if
these
headphones
would
work
well
for
me
so
far
they
have
been
great
spend
about
hours
on
the
phone
for
work
day
mentioned
to
few
people
have
new
headset
and
they
say
it
sounds
great
can
hear
others
clearlythe
shape
i'm
also
very
satisfied
with
could
never
figure
why
people
like
certain
headphones
that
look
like
cigarettes
in
your
ear
they
fit
snug
and
never
fall
outi
don't
listen
to
alot
of
music
through
them
but
some
podcasts
and
it's
greatthe
case
they
come
in
is
great
for
protection
and
charging
as
well
once
you
get
headphone
close
to
is
spot
the
magnet
pulls
it
in
tighti've
yet
to
use
much
of
the
touch
functions
in
headset
but
seems
pretty
good
already
to
turn
on
and
off
and
to
get
siri's
attentioni
would
definitely
recommend
these
for
what
i've
covered
they
are
really
nice
headphones
truly
wireless,
and
ima
go
as
far
to
say
that
they
are
better
then
the
apple
headphones
the
reason
why
say
that
is
because
have
had
them
for
weeks
now
only
charged
the
portable
charger
once
and
it
still
charges
my
ear
pods
in
hour
everyday
use
them
with
out
needing
to
be
changed
dont
know
how
it
stayed
charged
for
so
long
but
its
still
on
bars
dont
know
if
may
have
super
portable
one
but
im
happy
☺
this
thing
also
charges
my
phone
on
the
go
the
sound
quality
for
listening
to
music
is
nice
too
its
not
beats
by
dre
quality
but
it
works
it
also
has
good
voice
time
quality
with
your
family
and
friends
you
can
hear
them
clear
and
they
can
hear
you
clear
i've
walked
with
these
for
hours
and
0mins
listening
to
music
and
spent
hour
talking
on
the
phone
thats
when
the
battery
finally
got
low
all
in
all
the
best
headphones
you
can
buy
plus
when
you
add
the
dollar
price
tag
with
dollar
year
warranty
on
them,
how
could
anyone
say
that
the
apple
headphones
are
better
man
so
disappointed
purchased
these
on
july
and
loved
the
quality,
the
fit
and
finish,
everything
about
them
until
today,
august
the
right
ear
piece
stopped
working
it
just
wouldn
pair
with
my
phone
any
longer
the
left
one
continues
to
work
but
switch
them
out
while
at
work
and
without
both
they
become
far
lesser
in
value
the
plus
hour
battery
life
is
adequate
especially
when
wearing
one
at
time
as
have
at
work
so
disappointed
sound
greatly
decreased
by
third
time
using
them
will
be
replacing
also
didn't
receive
the
extra
ear
pieces
and
i'm
wondering
if
got
someone's
returnjust
got
these
and
used
them
on
bike
ride
the
sound
is
pretty
decent
and
they
seem
to
fit
pretty
well
my
issue
thus
far
is
they
are
extremely
sensitive
they
are
designed
for
you
to
tap
on
the
ear
piece
to
pause/skip
tracks
simply
adjusting
these
in
my
ears
created
inconveniences
considering
how
they
fit
in
the
ear
it
is
difficult
not
to
end
up
directing
the
tracks
just
by
putting
them
in,
taking
them
out,
even
when
pulled
some
hair
over
my
ears
and
touched
the
earpiece
will
start
off
with
the
bad,
and
there
was
only
one
bad
the
product
arrived
quickly
as
promised,
but
during
initial
setup,
could
only
get
sound
out
of
one
earbud
at
time
could
switch
it
back
and
forth
with
tap
on
the
earbud,
but
could
not
figure
out
what
was
going
on
contacted
pasonomi,
and
they
said
product
could
have
been
damaged
in
shipment
swapped
them
out
for
another
pair,
and
alas,
no
problems
whatsoever
the
written
instructions
were
not
that
clear,
but
there
is
video
on
the
pasonomi
facebook
page
which
makes
set
up
very
simple
within
two
minutes
was
up
and
rocking
the
earbuds
themselves
fit
very
well
in
my
ears,
and
there
are
also
different
sizes
included
if
it
did
not
sound
was
excellent
am
mainly
using
these
for
working
out,
and
the
quality
of
the
sound
was
excellent
as
well
love
the
case
it
comes
with,
and
the
magnetic
way
it
attaches
to
the
charging
station
it
even
comes
with
little
bag
to
store
everything
in
am
very
pleased
with
these
wireless
headphones,
and
for
the
price,
they
seem
to
be
an
excellent
buy
would
recommend
these
for
anyone
who
does
not
want
to
spend
the
ridiculous
amount
other
companies
charge
for
quality
bluetooth
wireless
earphones
these
are
really
excellent
want
to
say
up
front
that
anyone
who
thinks
these
have
no
bass
are
wearing
them
wrong
surprisingly
full
sound
from
treble
to
mid
to
bass
if
you
ve
got
the
right
size
earpieces
on,
and
have
them
in
tour
wars
rightgreat
features
too
touch
sensors
that
change
tracks
and
pause
charging
case
amazing
battery
life
on
the
buds
and
the
charger
case
would
have
paid
$0
for
product
like
this
definitely
surpassed
my
expectations
i've
had
these
for
about
month
now
and
have
no
complaints
mostly
use
these
when
bike
or
work
when
biking,
only
put
in
the
right
ear
bud
these
are
very
easy
to
set
up
each
ear
bud
separately
as
individual
bluetooth
devices
to
do
this,
simply
take
each
ear
bud
out
of
the
charging
case
individually
one
at
time,
don't
have
both
out
at
the
same
time,
and
pair
the
available
device
to
your
phone/laptop/whatever
just
have
mine
names
as
"l"
and
"r"
when
you
take
both
out
at
the
same
time,
they
connect
to
one
another
and
the
left
one
connects
to
your
device
note
that
when
using
only
one
ear
bud,
the
only
touch
control
you
have
is
single
tap
for
play/pause
and
double
tap
for
reverse
no
forward
or
volume
controloverall,
very
pleased
case
is
compact
and
provides
tons
of
charging
time
it
also
holds
the
ear
buds
in
place
with
magnets,
which
is
super
handy
they
aren't
the
most
comfortable
to
have
in
your
ear,
but
definitely
wouldn't
say
find
them
uncomfortable
very
intuitive
and
easy
to
use
first
of
all,
these
headphones
are
extremely
easy
to
pair
to
your
phone
they
come
in
magnetic
case
that
is
also
the
charging
base
they
were
partially
charged
when
received
them
but
charged
them
overnight
before
use
to
pair,
you
need
to
take
them
both
out
of
the
case
to
be
discovered
by
your
bluetooth
the
sound
quality
is
good
but
wouldn
say
they
are
completely
noise
cancelling
they
feel
comfortable
in
my
ears
and
come
with
extra
rubber
ear
pieces
used
them
on
and
off
all
day
and
they
didn
lose
their
charge
feel
like
they
make
me
look
like
in
the
matrix
though
overall,
think
they
are
good
quality
headphones
to
be
honest
was
skeptic
when
looking
at
the
shape
online
and
was
looking
at
the
beats,
etc
which
had
cord
between
the
earbuds
but
there
were
many
positive
reviews
so
went
ahead
and
ordered
when
the
earbuds
arrived,
they
surpassed
my
expectationsi
am
rock
climber
and
wore
these
while
bouldering
at
the
gym
even
when
falling
off
the
wall,
they
staying
in
my
ear
wore
them
while
jump
roping
and
they
stayed
in
my
ear
they
do
this
by
resting
on
the
inside
of
your
ear;
it's
comfortable
and
with
bit
of
wiggling,
feels
secure
the
sound
quality
was
great;
both
music
and
my
podcasts
were
enjoyable
music
can
be
paused/started
by
tapping
the
sidelastly,
they
were
easy
to
pair
with
my
phone
and
the
case
was,
surprisingly,
plus
the
earbuds
automatically
turn
on/off
when
they
enter/leave
the
case
and
they
charge
the
battery
when
they
enter
the
case
the
case
can
also
charge
your
phone
on
longer
trips,
though
not
feature
was
looking
for,
definitely
could
be
plus
while
traveling
i've
been
longtime
user
of
bluetooth
headphones,
the
kind
with
wire
connecting
the
two
buds
i've
tried
different
styles
loose
cable,
rigid
cable
that
is
meant
to
rest
on
the
nape
of
the
neck
they
all
get
in
the
way
at
the
gym,
especially
when
running
they
tend
to
tug
the
earbuds
out
with
the
last
pair
had,
the
music
would
frequently
cut
out
when
blocked
the
bluetooth
receptor
by
doing
some
overhead
motion
drove
me
crazy
probably
the
worst
part
is
when
they
die
at
the
beginning
of
workout
and
you
have
to
finish
the
whole
thing
musiclesswith
wireless
earbuds,
they
charge
every
time
you
put
them
back
in
the
case,
and
the
case
battery
lasts
very
long
time
about
week
for
me
with
~0
hrs/day
of
use,
so
you
never
need
to
worry
about
earbuds
dying
during
workout
plus
there
is
battery
level
indicator
in
the
case
can't
justify
spending
the
premium
on
airpods,
and
don't
like
airpod
fit
and
sound
quality
anyway,
so
went
with
these
they
worked
out
of
the
box
connect
to
"x0"
in
your
bluetooth
settings
and
last
about
hours
on
single
charge
they
fit
quite
well
in
my
ears,
similar
to
other
bluetooth
headphones
there
are
different
sizes
of
silicone
"mushrooms"
earbud
tips;
however,
did
use
tips
from
different
pair
of
earbuds
because
felt
the
included
ones
were
too
small
personal
preference,
like
tight,
noisecanceling
fit
and
don't
mind
little
ear
canal
pressurethe
charging
case
takes
microusb
input
and
can
charge
out
with
standard
usb
personally
never
see
myself
using
this
because
carry
around
much
larger
capacity
anker
battery
bank,
but
perhaps
if
you're
in
pinch
and

juice
my
one
complaint
is
that
the
extra
juice
in
this
case
makes
it
bit
larger,
and
don't
like
carrying
it
in
my
pocket
it's
0"

tend
to
leave
it
in

you've
been
using
regular
bluetooth
earbuds
or

wired
earbuds

jack
and
have
been
considering
trying
out
the
convenience
of
fully
wireless
earbuds
at
great
price
point,
definitely
check
these
out
so
wanted
to
replace
year
old
set
of
senso's
bluetooth
headphones
that
have
been
absolutely
phenomenal
these
came
and
all
looked
good
they
came
with
half
charge
and
so
did
the
case
they
turned
on
and
pair
quickly
and
was
pretty
happy
then
turned
on
some
music
and
my
smile
faded
the
tinniest
of
sounds
came
through
almost
no
treble,
absolutely
no
bass,
flat
mids
i'm
definitely
not
an
audiophile
considering
loved
my
$0
year
old
set
of
headphones
did
side
by
side
comparison
and
its
not
even
close
the
senso's
have
great
bass
and
good
mids
and
treble,
and
no
video
lag
using
bluetooth
the
pasonomi
is
thin
tinny
and
crackly
with
no
bass,
the
video
lags
several
seconds

up
using
the
tips
off
of
my
old

for
good

and
still
terrible
audioin
conclusion
the
form
of
these
is
great
the
charging
case
worked
ok,
and
they
are
light
weight
and
secure
in
my
ear
its
just
that
if
the
audio
is
no
good
then
you
can't
or
don't
want
to
listen
to
music
if
it
lags
too
bad
then
watching
videos
is
annoying,
so
what
are
these
good
for
this
little
guys
are
great
sound
is
clear,
not
completely
cancelling
but
pretty
good
battery
life
is
about
hours
and
they
can
be
pair
independently
the
only
thing
about
the
product
that
don't
love
is
when
call
comes
in
when
they
are
connected,
they
recite
the
number,
which
is
great,
but
if
you
answer
quickly,
it
keeps
talking
and
whomever
is
on
the
line
cant
hear
you
until
the
number
completes
if
this
is
fixed
in
the
software,
would
give
stars
there
is
also
not
lot
of
information
in
the
instruction
that
come
with
themalso
had
great
experience
with
service
when
contacted
them
through
amazon
had
accidentally
deleted
the
pairing
and
they
would
not
reset
and
could
not
find
any
information
on
how
to
reset
online
and
get
them
to
pair
to
my
phone
again
customer
service
was
quick
and
sent
back
very
specific
instructions
on
how
to
reset
and
get
them
paired
again
am
very
happy
with
these
and
will
buy
again
and
would
recommend
to
others
these
are
pretty
sweet
set
of
little
earbuds
the
sound
quality
is
good
and
clear
and
the
fitment
is
comfortable
not
too
loose
or
to
tight
their
charge
lasts
for
hours
on
end
haven't
had
them
die
on
me
yet
using
for
hours
straight
the
earbuds
come
with
micro
usb
charging
cable
and
many
different
sized
silicone
earbuds
to
swap
out
as
you
feel
fit
these
are
true
wireless
bluetooth
earbuds
at
very
competitive
price
great
purchase
for
the
active
person
who
doesn't
want
to
be
tied
down
by
cords
the
other
positive
bonus
is
that
the
case
is
also
charging
box
for
the
earbuds
not
only
that,
but
the
case
can
also
charge
cell
phone
as
well
don
buy
them
tried
to
be
cheap
and
avoid
buying
ear
pods
or
legit
headphones
spend
the
extra
money
because
these
are
cheaply
mademanufactured
in
place
where
items
are
cheap
and
massively
produced,
the
battery
life
is
non
existent
one
headphone
charges
and
the
other
doesn
sometimes
the
charging
case
they
live
in
will
turn
on
randomly
and
drain
itselfjust
cheap
embarrassing
if
it
was
gift
loved
these
earbuds,
they
are
manageable
size
and
stay
in
my
ears
when
running
especially
liked
the
long
battery
life
plus
that
fact
that
the
case
can
recharge
the
earbuds
0+
times
and
be
used
as
power
bank
in
pinch
they
also
sounded
pretty
decent
as
well
and
couldn't
hear
thing
around
me
when
using
the
right
size
silicone
tips
to
make
sure
had
good
seal
in
my
earhowevermy
first
pair's
right
bud
started
fading
out
and
becoming
quiet
after
about
weeks
and
would
not
come
back
this
happened
just
towards
the
end
of
my
return
window
so
returned
them
and
bought
replacement
set
thought,
maybe
just
had
bad
pair
but
my
second
pair
did
the
exact
same
thing
in
about
the
same
amount
of
time
so
returned
those
as
well
was
not
willing
to
try
again
because
what
if
they
last
just
week
longer
next
time
and
i'm
out
of
my
return
window
bought
similar
pair
from
different
brand
so
we'll
see
how
long
these
last
love
the
size
of
the
ear
buds
and
the
sound
quality
is
awesome,
like
the
compact
size
of
the
charging
case
and
that
you
can
get
multiple
charges
out
of
it,
they
do
fit
very
well
in
my
ears
also
they
don't
hurt
my
ears
at
all,
but
the
battery
life
is
not
great
at
all,
and
that
is
charging
them
prior
to
use,
started
listening
at
0:0
am
0:0
they
needed
to
be
charged
only
and
half
hours,
that's
the
reason
for
the
star
review
will
keep
them
as
to
use
for
short
durations
if
your
looking
to
buy
these
be
aware
that
they
will
need
to
be
charged
often
the
headphones
work
pretty
well
indoors
and
the
sound
is
decent
for
truly
wireless
buds
but
as
soon
as
you
take
them
outside,
the
sound
cuts
out
constantly
unless
you
have
your
phone
outside
of
your
pockets
the
touch
controls
can
be
very
annoying,
as
they
are
sensative
any
brush
against
the
headphone,
even
from
water,
will
pause
the
audio
or
bring
up
voice
command
it
is
also
very
annoying
that
you
can't
turn
them
off
unless
you
put
them
back
in
the
charger,
which
is
bit
bulky
to
carry
aroundi
blame
myself
for
not
returning
them
initially
but
after
couple
months
with
minimal
useindoors
the
sound
went
out
on
the
right
headphone
emailed
the
company
for
any
advice
or
help
and
got
zero
replyspend
few
more
dollars
and
buy
from
more
reliable
company
was
tired
of
working
out
with
regular
earphones
because
they'd
keep
getting
snagged
on
things
like
my
hands
when
running
eventually
put
the
cord
in
my
shirti
then
had
pair
that
wrapped
around
my
head,
but
they'd
get
stuck
on
my
neck
after
sweating,
so
makes
turning
your
head
without
popping
one
out
pretty
easyso,
finally
bought
this
true
wireless
set
and
was
initially
pleased,
the
extra
earbud
covers
were
never
able
to
fit
right
in
my
ear
and
after
some
time,
they
felt
like
fish
hooks,
so
replaced
them
with
deeper
earbud
covers
from
another
deviceahhhh,
much
betternow
for
the
really
weird
stuff
despite
following
the
directions
from
the
manual,
the
right
earbud
was
always
considerably
lower
than
the
left
one
no
matter
what
tried
to
do
reset,
resync,
use
one
at
time,
adjust
volume
on
my
phone
the
right
one
never
was
loud
enough
to
hear
went
back
to
standard
earbuds
to
test
if
my
hearing
was
badnope,
it
was
equal
sounding
on
that
pair
if
had
the
volume
up
to
normal
where
can
have
conversation
but
still
listen
to
music
and
took
out
the
left
earbud
on
this
pasonomi,
then
the
right
sounded
like
someone
was
whispering
i'd
pump
up
the
volume
to
get
the
right
one
louder,
but
then
the
left
one
sounded
like
was
at
rock
concertdirections
said
that
putting
the
earbuds
into
the
charging
case
with
the
charge
cable
plugged
into
wall
outlet
would
shut
off
the
buds
nope,
not
the
all
i'm
sitting
here
and
hear
the
muffled
sound
of
music
and
when
walk
over
to
the
pasonomi
charging
case,
sure
enough
the
earbuds
are
"on"
and
playing
songs
from
my
phone
can't
shut
these
darn
things
off
which
comes
to
my
other
issue
with
these
budsthe
directions
say
to
hold
the
mfb
for
seconds
to
turn
them
on
when
they
are
actually
off,
ok
that
worked
then
hold
for
seconds
to
turn
them
off
negative
it
just
beeps
and
the
stays
paired
to
each
other
and
the
devicei
literally
had
to
let
the
batteries
run
out
or
turn
off
bluetooth
on
my
phone
these
earbuds
keep
autoconnecting,
even
when
they're
in
the
charging
case
and
plugged
into
an
outlet
i've
had
them
in
my
car,
in
knapsack,
coat
pocket
and
each
time
my
phone
rang
and
i'd
answerthe
pasonomi
x0's
would
immediately
commandeer
wait,
hijack,
the
phone
call
so
had
to
constantly
grab
them
or
quickly
press
the
button
on
my
phone
to
switchagain,
initial
month
or
were
bliss,
but
now
it
seems
to
have
given
up
the
ghost
or
at
least
the
rightside
ghost
after
months
if
was
going
to
be
stuck
with
one
earbud,
should
have
only
paid
half
the
pricebuyer
beware
not
as
loud
as
would
like,
but
good
sound
quality
but
do
have
some
hearing
loss
so
maybe
that
why
don
think
they
are
loud
enough
update
these
headphones
are
way
too
sensitive
if
move
my
head
certain
way,
they
will
pause
my
music
or
audiobook,
or
drop
important
phone
calls
when
in
phone
call,
the
other
person
can
barely
hear
me
no
problem,
ll
just
take
them
out
well
doing
that
somehow
hangs
up
the
call
very
frustrating
looking
for
other
options
liked
these
headphones
for
the
first
few
months
of
using
them
the
battery
life
of
the
charging
case
is
amazing,
used
them
0x
week
and
only
had
to
charge
the
case
itself
once
every
weeksthe
sound
quality
is
good,
it
clear,
and
the
bluetooth
range
was
impressivethere
isn
too
much
for
noise
cancellation,
but
fine
with
that
as
that
was
not
my
purpose
for
buying
thesenow
that
it
been
about
months
since
ve
bought
these,
they
suddenly
disconnected
from
my
phone
and
are
no
longer
showing
up
at
all
in
my
discoverable
devices
or
saved
devices
frustrated
and
disappointed
in
that
they
re
basically
now
useless
ve
tried
to
restart
my
phone,
recharge
the
case,
messing
with
each
ear
bud,
disconnecting
and
reconnecting
my
bluetooth,
removing
all
of
my
precious
bluetooth
devices
and
trying
to
reconnect
them,
etc
it
just
these
headphones
that
no
longer
seem
to
be
compatible
with
my
iphone
xsi
still
going
to
give
them
good
review
for
their
price,
fit,
sound
quality,
and
battery
life
but
in
terms
of
the
overall
product
life
months
apparently
when
first
received
these,
they
were
great
the
sound
is
good,
the
charge
lasted
long
time,
and
they
stayed
well
in
my
ears
four
months
later,
they
won't
keep
any
charge
plug
in
the
charger,
put
them
in
my
ear,
and
it
says
they
need
to
be
charged
wipe
them
off
with
damp
cloth
after
every
use,
and
i've
cleaned
off
the
place
where
they
connect
for
charging
nothing
works
contacted
"customer
service,"
which,
by
the
way
is
china,
and
they
said
to
send
me
video
of
the
problem
now
how
do
you
video
charging
them
and
then
putting
in
your
ear
and
"hearing"
that
they
need
to
be
charged
this
is
put
off,
and
i'm
really
annoyed
beware
although
they
are
good
to
start
with,
i'm
afraid
they
will
not
last
good
product
for
the
price
the
battery
life
is
good
the
battery
life
in
the
charging
unit
is
excellent
have
gone
weeks
without
charging
it,
so
when
the
buds
go
dead
just
pop
them
in
and
i'm
ready
to
go
in
about
minutes
purchased
this
in
and
in
the
last
month
my
calls
were
dropping
which
was
inconvenient
but
no
problems
with
listening
to
music
suggest
getting
the
insurance
because
made
claim
they
reimbursed
the
money
paid
didn't
have
to
return
the
damaged
ones
ended
up
getting
another
pair
was
looking
for
bluetooth
headphones
while
working
and
listening
to
music
on
my
macbook
something
lightweight
and
fairly
invisible
unlike
white
airpods
and
these
had
some
very
solid
reviews
it
took
minute
to
two
to
get
both
of
them
connected
to
my
laptop
but
it's
been
super
easy
ever
since
the
initial
pairing
i'm
pretty
impressed
with
the
sound
quality,
isolation
is
quite
good
and
the
build
quality
is
rock
solid,
especially
given
the
price
the
earbud
tips
are
shaped
differently
than
most
but
had
no
problem
switching
them
for
one
of
the
smaller
included
pairs
and
got
really
nice
seal
i'm
notorious
for
always
adjusting
headphones
and
i've
noticed
that
don't
fuss
with
these
as
much
the
fact
that
the
case
doubles
as
battery
pack
is
nice
touch
too
was
truly
surprised
by
the
sound
and
quality
of
this
earbuds
honestly
didn't
expect
much
from
these
until
opened
the
box
in
which
it
was
packaged
nicely
in
easy
to
store,
it
also
has
led
lights
on
the
front
to
indicate
charging
operation
is
simple
was
surprised
with
the
amount
of
bass
coming
from
these
did
not
expect
that
at
all
did
test
these
out
on
the
treadmill
also
and
they
did
fine
for
0minute
run,
they
held
in
place
and
sweat
is
definitely
not
an
issueoverall,
am
very
pleased
with
the
product
my
son
bought
these
for
my
birthday
because
can
charge
the
battery
while
using
earbuds
on
the
iphone
they
are
fantastic
petite
so
some
earbuds
don
fit
comfortably
on
my
ears
these
look
big
but
they
re
very
comfortable
and
fit
snugly
sound
quality
is
great
and
the
recharging
case
is
very
nice
the
earbuds
fit
in
by
magnet
like
that
can
pause
movie
by
tapping
the
earbud
nice
featureseems
to
be
high
quality
product
and
very
happy
with
it
absolutely
love
my
pasonomi
wireless
earbudsas
person
who
listens
to
hours
and
hours
of
all
types
of
music,
the
concept
of
wireless
earbuds
seemed
amazing
to
me,
and
wanted
to
get
pair
of
airpods
so
badly
however,
when
looked
at
the
price
of
them,
they
were
much
too
expensive
for
me,
and
lost
all
hope
believing
that
they
were
the
only
wireless
earbuds
on
the
market
later,
after
some
research
on
amazon,
came
to
realize
that
there
were
countless
wireless
earbuds
everywhere,
most
of
which
were
blatant
copies
of
airpods
from
sketchy
companies
these
ripoffs
are
usually
scams
and
don
work
well
or
at
all
pasonomi
earbuds
are
different
they
leave
behind
the
design
of
airpods
and
adopt
new
shape
that
can
say
with
confidence
is
much
better
with
their
ergonomic
design,
they
fit
perfectly
in
my
ears
and
have
passive
noise
cancelling
capabilities
that
leave
even
some
overear
headphones
in
the
dust
the
sound
quality
is
amazing,
and
some
of
my
friends
who
own
airpods
say
that
it
is
better
they
are
comfortable,
and
their
case
is
larger
meaning
that
the
case
battery
is
much
larger
also,
have
never
gotten
to
the
point
at
which
they
are
on
low
battery,
so
their
individual
batteries
are
amazing
as
well
everyone,
purchase
these,
they
are
absolutely
stunning
and
better
than
airpods
first
off,
this
is
real
review,
completely
unsolicitedi
am
traveling
more
for
work
and
was
looking
for
some
wireless
earbuds
to
save
space
in
my
bag
since
my
wireless
anc
headphones
take
up
too
much
space
the
thing
that
really
drew
me
to
these
was
the
larger
battery
that
could
use
for
charging
my
phone
but
noticed
the
sound
was
better
than
expected
out
of
these
are
they
suitable
for
audiophiles
probably
not
but
they
are
more
than
sufficient
for
watching
movie
on
the
plane
are
just
jamming
to
some
tunes
while
working
and
the
bass
is
not
near
as
bad
as
some
of
these
reviews
make
it
out
to
be
wish
they
were
bit
more
comfortable
in
my
ear
thus
the
stars
not
deal
breaker
though
probably
just
need
smaller
bud
cover
the
touch
controls
are
pretty
responsive
and
fairly
intuitive
i've
only
had
them
for
day
and
have
had
them
in
now
for
about
hours
with
no
battery
issues
yet
i'll
update
if
my
opinion
changes
i've
only
received
this
couple
of
days
ago,
so
can't
comment
on
durability
they
pair
well
with
my
other
devises
and
connect
quickly
sound
quality
is
very
good
for
moderately
priced
earbuds
the
case
is
bit
larger
and
heavier
than
some
others,
but
only
slightly
so;
and
the
battery
inside
is
claimed
to
allow
numerous
recharges
of
the
earbuds,
to
the
extent
that
it
can
be
used
like
power
bank
to
recharge
other
devices
finally,
they
are
comfortable,
and
feel
secure
so
far
am
completely
pleased
was
considering
various
wireless
bluetooth
earbuds
including
the
more
expensive
ones,
but
took
chance
on
this
one
looked
at
all
the
features
available
in
this
set
and
it
seemed
very
good
valuehad
to
buy
this
as
replacement
for
earphones
that
was
using
taking
calls
got
constant
complaints
from
my
coworkers
about
the
voice
being
muffled
and
inaudible
seems
that
complaint
has
been
resolved
since
using
these
earbudsthe
appearance
of
the
earbuds
is
very
good
and
the
charging
unit
also
is
of
high
qualitypairing
was
very
easy
and
was
able
to
quickly
start
using
these
earbuds
with
my
samsung
s0my
first
impressions
of
the
product
are
pretty
good
the
sound
quality
for
listening
to
music
as
well
as
for
calls
is
very
goodthe
control
pad
took
some
time
getting
used
to,
but
once
you
get
used
to
it,
it
becomes
very
convenientas
has
been
advised
in
some
other
reviews,
remember
to
remove
the
green
protective
plastic
strips,
so
that
the
earbuds
can
chargehappy
with
the
purchase
so
far
in
less
than
months
the
left
earbud
stopped
working
no
way
to
contact
seller
to
resolve
buy
at
your
own
risk
update:
changing
the
star
rating
after
contacting
the
seller,
they
advised
that
clean
the
earbud
by
removing
the
tip
and
wiping
down
the
white
filter
that
resolved
the
problem
and
now
the
volume
is
the
same
as
the
right
ear
bud
only
reason
didn't
give
stars
is
because
the
battery
life
isn't
really
good,
hours
at
best
spent
*maybe*
$0
on
my
first
pair
of
bluetooth
headphones
over
years
ago
from
groupon
and
after
they
finally
started
to
lose
connection
to
one
ear
decided
to
spring
for
more
expensive
pair
was
happy
with
the
sound
quality
of
my
old
pair
but
was
expecting
lot
more
out
of
this
pair
especially
after
reading
all
the
reviews
after
listening
to
many
different
types
of
music
there
is
consistent
tinny
staticy
sound
during
certain
parts
of
the
music
it
also
seems
like
it's
more
in
the
left
side
than
the
right
have
used
these
twice,
both
for
less
than
half
of
my
workout
because
the
sound
was
so
distracting
also,
the
controls
seem
cool
but
was
adjusting
them
lot
and
accidentally
paused
them
each
time
so
it
ended
up
being
more
of
hassle
than
useful
will
be
sending
back
asap
am
pleasantly
surprised
at
the
performance
of
this
product
was
nervous
because
of
the
negative
reviews
received
this
product
on
march
and
started
actively
using
it
on
march
on
very
regular
basis
like
that
you
can
still
hear
what's
going
on
around
you
while
listening
through
the
earbuds
the
sound
quality
is
great
for
talking
and
listening
to
talk
videosi
was
able
to
get
hours
use
out
of
each
earbud
just
as
stated
at
first
the
earbuds
didn't
fit
well
in
my
ears,
but
simple
change
in
size
of
the
provided
ear
caps
solved
the
problem
however,
that
is
why
rated
them
rather
than
have
small
ears
and
so
the
fit
is
not
ideal,
but
they
do
stay
in
my
ear
believe
this
problem
prevents
me
from
experiencing
the
full
sound
quality
the
instructions
provided
were
easy
to
follow
no
issues
pairing
the
earbuds
to
each
other
or
my
devicein
conclusion,
the
charging
box
arrived
fully
charged
and
basically
making
the
earbuds
ready
to
use
with
that
being
said,
today
is
march
and
this
will
be
the
day
charge
the
box
for
the
first
time
used
these
earbuds
to
stream
youtube
videos,
talk
on
my
phone
and
listen
to
music
literally
all
day
long
this
required
recharging
each
earbud
at
least
to
times
per
day,
once
each
at
work
and
once
or
twice
each
at
home
hope
this
continues
to
give
me
pleasure
and
ease
of
use
for
long
time
to
come
used
the
pasonomi
bluetooth
earbuds
while
running
for
totally
hands
and
cord
free
experience
was
able
to
easily
pair
with
my
samsung
smartwatch
the
first
week
they
were
great
was
really
impressed
with
the
sound
quality
and
ease
of
use,
and
they
fit
well
in
my
ears
then
noticed
over
the
next
couple
weeks
the
sound
quality
was
fading
was
having
to
adjust
the
volume
higher
and
higher
after
the
0nd
week
the
right
earbud
had
hardly
any
sound
volume
inspected
the
ear
buds
thinking
maybe
little
earwax
could
be
the
issue;
however,
there
wasn't
any
wax
build
up
at
all
was
trying
to
change
the
ear
fitting
for
snugger
fit
to
see
is
this
may
help
with
the
right
earbud,
and
the
little
screen
that
fits
over
the
end
of
the
earbud
feel
out
now
the
right
earbud
beeps
in
my
ear
and
will
not
play
music
so,
will
contact
the
company
and
see
what
we
can
do
about
thisif
can
get
the
screen
replaced
think
the
earbuds
will
be
great
initially
this
was
great
purchase
just
take
them
out
of
the
charge
case
and
they
pair
automatically
however,
after
about
one
week,
the
left
earpiece
would
not
pair
leaving
me
eith
only
the
right
ear
piece
have
completely
unpaired
them
and
started
over
but
the
issue
remainsi
will
contact
seller
and
update
the
review
as
they
respondupdate:
contacted
seller
with
issues
was
having
after
some
back
and
forth,
the
seller
sent
me
brand
new
pair
and
so
far
i've
had
no
problems
with
them
stars
only
because
their
customer
service
is
slow
to
respond
and
the
hassle
work
in
pretty
loud
shop
where
hammering,
impacts
and
grinders
are
everyday
earplugs
can
get
lonely
without
music
coming
out
so
bought
pair
of
these
ear
buds
to
help
out
with
this
problem
of
mine
and
was
not
satisfied
the
first
day
they
came
in
tried
them
at
the
house
and
they
were
fine
sounded
great
and
functioned
like
it
should
then
at
work,
they
worked
just
as
good
but
for
only
about
an
hour,
the
volume
went
out
on
them
so
sent
back
the
set
and
gave
it
one
one
more
chance
then
that
pair
went
out
after
days
the
second
pair
had
few
more
issues
so
just
decided
to
just
get
my
money
back
absolutely
love
these
headphones
have
an
iphone
and
they
pair
great
with
them
used
them
while
i'm
working
out,
at
work,
and
riding
in
cars
for
long
road
trips
they
fit
comfortably
in
my
ear
they
can
also
be
discreet
if
needed
they
hold
charge
pretty
well
don't
charge
them
for
weeks
at
time
like
how
the
compact
can
double
as
charger
for
my
phone
as
well
will
purchase
them
again
if
needed
these
wireless
ear
buds
are
great
i've
had
them
for
about
months,
and
for
the
most
part,
they've
been
issuefree
more
recently,
i've
had
occasional
issues
with
the
right
ear
bud
not
automatically
turning
on
and
syncing
when
remove
it
from
the
charging
case,
but
by
putting
it
back
in
the
case
and
taking
it
back
out,
it
seems
to
reset
and
workthe
battery
life
is
exactly
as
described
use
these
all
the
time,
and
have
only
had
to
charge
the
case
once
since
purchasing
this
productthe
sound
quality
is
okay
listen
to
audiobooks,
and
for
that,
the
sound
quality
is
just
fine,
but
were
listening
to
music,
feel
like
the
quality
would
be
too
flat/diluted
to
be
enjoyablethe
ear
buds
aren't
noise
cancelling,
but
that's
perfect
for
me,
as
it
allows
me
to
easily
pause
my
books
and
talk
with
my
family
without
removing
themas
an
added
bonus,
use
these
while
on
conference
calls
at
home
and
they
work
excellently
the
microphone
is
fantastic,
and
have
no
issues
with
others
on
the
phone
hearing
me
clearly
i've
even
walked
my
dogs
near
park
while
using
these
ear
buds
for
call
and
the
individual
on
the
other
end
could
hear
me
clearlyif
you're
not
sure
about
these,
i'd
highly
encourage
you
to
give
them
try,
especially
at
such
low
price
point
these
earbuds
are
really
convenient
they
connect
to
my
phone
or
computer
and
each
other
automatically
once
you
take
them
out
of
the
case
the
case
is
smaller
than
bar
of
soap
so
it
super
easy
to
put
in
my
backpack
or
purse
it
also
nice
that
it
acts
as
portable
charger
you
could
probably
find
ear
buds
with
better
sound
quality
but
for
what
this
product
costs,
the
sound
quality
is
pretty
decent
couple
of
negative
things:
the
right
earbud
doesn
work
unless
the
left
earbud
is
out
of
the
case,
however,
the
left
earbud
works
while
the
right
is
in
the
case
also,
ve
had
this
product
for
days
and
ve
already
had
three
people
think
that
am
wearing
hearing
aids
it
fine
but
don
enjoy
having
to
explain
to
people
that
they
are
earbuds
had
to
return
the
first
set,
and
customer
service
was
great
here
improved
my
ratings
based
upon
the
second
set
they
were
easy
to
connect
to
my
phone
on
sound
quality,
the
midranges
are
quite
crisp
i'd
like
to
hear
more
low
range,
but
good
for
work,
and
stays
put
on
workouts
and
yard
work
did
changed
out
the
silicon
ear
pieces,
which
improved
sound
and
comfort
the
charging
case
is
nice,
and
allows
for
multiple
workouts
before
needing
recharge
overall
these
are
good
midpriced
earbuds
my
husband
got
pair
of
wireless
head
phones
for
christmas
have
been
wanting
pair
since
then
these
were
extremely
easy
to
set
up
and
use
the
sound
quality
is
great
the
charging
box
is
small
and
convenient
way
to
keep
the
earbuds
safe
while
charging
the
only
downside
is
that
they
are
not
super
comfortable
it
does
come
with
six
sizing
options
so
maybe
just
need
to
play
around
more
with
the
different
options
to
find
the
right
fit
really
like
that
you
can
pause/play
whatever
you
are
listening
to
from
the
ear
buds
themselves
also
love
that
they
are
waterproof
overall,
think
these
are
great
buy
if
you're
buying
these
ear
buds
to
listen
to
podcast
then
you'll
be
0%
happy
however,
if
you
listen
to
music
and
like
nice
and
full
sound
then
these
fall
way
short
of
marginal
the
sound
is
tinny
and
lacks
any
real
depth
i'm
not
an
audiophile
and
will
never
notice
the
nuances
of
great
headphone
however,
will
notice
when
something
sounds
bad
these
sound
bad
pass
on
these
and
do
what
i'm
going
to
do
from
now
onwatch
youtube
review
before
making
purchase
on
something
like
these
i've
had
these
for
weeks
of
course
the
return
window
is
days
and
already
they
are
not
working
properly
i've
probably
used
them
times
over
that
period
of
time
now
they
will
not
charge
left
one
nor
will
they
hold
charge
for
longer
than
minutes
right
one
they
also
do
not
disconnect
from
my
phone
so
have
to
go
into
setttings
and
"forget
this
device"
after
each
time
they
are
used
and
then
repare
them
when
i'm
ready
to
use
them
again
total
pain
in
the
a**
should
of
known
something
was
up
when
the
instructions
actually
go
over
this
problem
and
the
grammer
in
the
instructions
is
all
incorrect
piece
of
garbage
we'll
see
how
their
"customer
service"
is
and
will
update
this
review
later
after
one
month
since
purchasing,
they
have
proven
to
be
well
worth
the
price
the
audio
quality
is
on
par
to
other
wired
headphones
not
much
base,
however
find
that
if
moisten
the
rubber
ear
piece,
there
is
strong
seal
which
helps
amplify
the
sound
and
dampen
external
noise
can
speak
of
their
water
resistance
as
have
not
tried
them
under
wet
conditions
the
audio
during
phone
call
seemed
to
be
average
or
somewhat
below
as
the
recipient
mentioned
there
was
mild
difficulty
hearing
me
don
use
it
much
for
calls,
however
they
stay
in
place
with
ease
and
felt
like
barely
noticed
them
in
my
ears
these
earbuds
are
well
worth
the
money
and
purchase
them
again
if
had
the
choice
overall
thought
these
were
great
headphones
always
have
an
extremely
hard
time
fitting
any
headphones
in
my
ear
and
these
actually
fit
and
stayed
in
through
multiple
movements
when
using
the
volume
up
or
down
lot
of
times
the
siri
would
kick
in
because
that
hold
for
two
seconds
versus
the
seconds
to
change
the
volume
however,
once
you
get
used
to
the
touches
it
easier
thought
the
quality
of
the
sound
was
great
as
well
if
it
had
touch
more
base
would
give
it
stars
versus
would
definitely
recommend
this
produce
for
someone
who
is
looking
for
wireless
headphones
that
actually
stay
in
your
ear
and
the
fact
that
they
charge
in
the
case
is
very
convenient

bought
these
ear
pods
because
lost
my
airpods
at
first
didn
expect
them
to
be
super
good,
but
later
was
surprised
by
the
crisp
sound
quality
of
this
pair
of
ear
pods
the
battery
life
isn
bad
used
them
for
week,
hours
day,
and
have
charged
it
twice
or
three
times
the
looking
of
this
product
is
little
cheapfeeling,
personally
don
like
the
idea
that
there
is
red
led
blinking
during
charging
probably
white
led
would
be
better
but
all
in
all
this
is
good
purchase
and
costefficient
it's
not
the
best
out
there,
but
this
one
definitely
outperforms
for
its
price
did
lot
of
research
on
the
earbuds
in
this
cost
range,
and
i'm
glad
chose
these
pair
the
pairing
functionality
is
nearinstant,
the
battery
life
is
plenty
respectable,
and
the
sound
quality
is
just
fine
the
only
drawback
is
probably
its
calltaking
feature
just
make
sure
you're
out
of
the
wind
before
you
try
to
have
conversation
would
recommend
wholeheartedly
tried
these
earphones
and
they
worked
really
well
the
magnetic
charging
case
is
really
convenient
and
easy
portable
the
earphone
fits
really
well
it
wont
come
off
easily
and
they
can
work
separately
it
is
super
sensitive
to
touch
thought
that
you
could
listen
to
each
bed
separately
but
doesn't
seem
to
work
it
only
allows
the
left
one
as
single
earbud

make
out
what
is
being
said
satisfactorily
this
is
my
first
wireless
earbuds
and
so
far
i'm
loving
it
as
there
is
no
string
that
connects
these
i've
been
wanting
something
like
this
for
quite
some
time
love
how
this
comes
with
case
that
you
can
charge
the
earbuds
in
the
case
is
also
magnetic
so
it
stays
close
with
no
problem
besides
the
case,
it
also
come
with
bag
to
put
this
in
but
use
it
to
store
the
extra
silicone
earcases
and
instructions
the
one
thing
did
notice
is
the
lack
of
base
like
read
in
some
reviews
but
it
doesn't
bother
me
in
this
case
so
far
it
fits
great
in
my
ear
and
have
no
problems
so
far
was
bit
hesitant
when
bought
these
headphones,
regardless
of
all
the
good
reviews
my
main
concern
is
because
have
piercings
in
my
ears
that
make
harder
styled
wireless
headphones,
like
airpods,
to
never
fit
snuggly
and
always
fall
out
these
fit
wonderful
in
my
ears
since
they
re
softer
and
conform
around
my
piercingsthey
have
great
sound
and
noise
cancellation
for
when
go
on
walks
tested
them
out
for
an
entire
morning
while
doing
chores
to
see
if
after
time
my
ears
would
start
to
hurt
they
did
bit
after
about
five
or
six
hours,
but
it
wasn't
long
before
they
stoppedi
also
loved
that
they
synced
really
well
to
my
iphone
and
the
battery
life
is
amazing
haven
had
to
charge
them
once
since
purchasing
them
there
were
some
issues
with
the
grammar
in
the
instructions,
but
nothing
that
was
too
bad
proper
grammar
check
might
help,
but
overall
these
are
great
headphones
i'm
stunned
at
how
easy
these
are
to
set
up
and
use
very
user
friendly
was
cautious
at
first
about
picking
up
set
like
these
because
wasn't
sure
how
they
would
work
i'm
really
glad
that
did
get
them
after
all
couldn't
be
happier
and,
the
soundwell
the
sound
is
really
impressive
have
several
sets
of
headphones
that
use
for
my
music,
and
these
put
out
very
respectable
sound
have
not
used
these
for
phone
calls
yet
overall,
am
greatly
impressed
with
these
buds
got
these
earbuds
mainly
for
running
and
they
took
some
getting
used
to
didn't
particularly
enjoy
the
sound
quality
or
fit
at
first
but
they're
more
comfortable
now
that
i've
been
wearing
them
for
bit
thought
the
touch
feature
would
be
cool,
but
it
ended
up
being
more
of
nuisance
than
benefit
because
it's
too
easy
to
accidentally
brush
your
finger
on
the
surface
while
adjusting
them
the
range
and
battery
life
are
good
also
can
barely
hear
anything
anyone
says
when
have
them
in
so
they're
great
for
noise
cancellation
was
worried
that
they
would
fall
out
of
my
ears
while
running
but
they
hold
in
just
fine
bought
these
earbuds
with
so
so
expectations
have
hard
time
keeping
ear
buds
in
my
ears
and
without
wire,
was
worried
they
would
slip
out
while
working
out
have
worn
these
about
times
to
the
gym
the
touch
commands
on
the
buds
are
confusing
and
hard
to
understand
but
once
you
get
the
hang
of
them,
they
are
fine
they
come
with
multiple
size
ear
cushions
they
originally
slipped
out
of
my
ears
bit
once
worked
up
good
seat,
but
once
went
up
size
in
the
cushion,
they
stopped
slipping
have
used
the
elliptical,
run
on
the
treadmill
and
done
floor
exercises
and
they
have
been
great
didn't
know
what
to
expect
since
these
were
so
cheap
but
they
actually
work
very
well
wanted
to
be
critical
of
these
because
of
the
price
but
this
is
my
go
to
headset
for
workoutsthe
sound
quality
is
good
and
it
pairs
very
quickly
the
charging
case
works
real
well
i'd
definitely
recommend
for
the
price
you
won't
find
better
valuemy
complaints,
don't
think
it's
true
bluetooth
the
pair
does
pair
further
away
than
pair
of
bluetooth
headphones
have
but
i'm
told
bluetooth
is
supposed
to
have
times
the
range
which
don't
think
this
headset
is
capable
of
based
on
my
experience
i'd
say
doublethe
only
other
complaint
is
notice
on
some
sites
eg
cnncom
there's
little
lag
in
the
video
playback
and
audio
picked
up
by
the
headset
however,
on
my
plex
media
server
where
have
movies
and
tv
shows,
the
audio
syncs
just
finei'd
recommend
to
buy
if
you're
not
looking
to
break
the
bank
it's
definitely
good
product
for
the
price
this
is
pair
of
ear
buds
that
is
operated
via
touch
controls
instead
of
buttons
if
that
sounds
terrible
it's
because
it
is
on
good
day
they
are
challenge
to
us
and
if
you
plan
to
use
them
while
working
stay
awaythe
controls:
you
tap
an
ear
bud
once
to
pause
the
music,
double
tap
to
skip
forward
or
backwards
pausing
usually
works
on
the
first
try
after
long
pause
skipping
usually
takes
two
tries
these
are
the
inputs
that
work
well
the
user
experience
falls
apart
when
trying
to
raise
or
lower
the
volume
to
do
this,
you
press
the
left
or
right
ear
bud
for
several
excruciating
seconds
after
one
eternity
tone
will
sound
but
if
you
let
go
now
nothing
will
happen
you
have
to
keep
holding
for
several
more
seconds
eventually
the
volume
will
start
raising/lowering
in
steps
it's
up
to
you
to
detect
when
the
volume
has
decreased
one
or
more
notches
and
release
the
bud
with
careful
timing
if
you
overshoot
then
prepare
to
repeat
the
process
on
the
opposite
side
this
is
miserable
experience
but
isnt
exactly
showstopper
that
comes
when
any
part
of
you
gets
wetmy
experience:
for
the
past
couple
weeks
since
purchased
these
ear
buds
i've
struggled
to
use
them,
but
today
was
what
made
me
throw
them
out
was
going
for
run
it's
humid
day
so
got
pretty
sweaty
at
one
point
decided
to
repeat
song
that
just
played
input
the
gesture
several
times
and
nothing
happened
eventually
after
had
stopped
touching
the
device
heard
the
volume
tone
the
device
then
proceeded
to
decrease
the
volume
until
it
shrunk
out
of
existence
after
bit
of
struggling
managed
to
raise
it
again
undershot
the
volume
wanted
and
then
it
flat
out
stopped
responding
to
inputs,
so
just
sort
of
gave
up
and
listened
to
music
quietely
as
ran
then
without
any
prompt
at
all
the
ear
buds
raised
to
max
volume
immediately
threw
them
in
the
trashi've
had
other
gripes
with
these
ear
buds
they
fall
out,
lose
connection
with
my
phone
constantly,
can't
be
turned
off
without
the
dock
but
no
issues
are
as
critical
as
the
controls
if
don't
plan
to
use
these
for
exercise
and
never
plan
to
adjust
the
volume
then
they
might
work
ok
but
if
you
plan
to
use
these
for
running
recommend
the
phaiser
bhs0
instead
in
my
experience
they
stop
working
after
maybe
months
of
near
daily
use
but
that's
still
better
than
all
other
products
i've
tried
and
they
work
really
well
until
then
best
of
all
they
have
buttons
these
ear
buds
have
proved
to
be
much
better
than
expected
the
sound
quality
is
more
then
need
and
battery
life
supports
my
needs
very
well
and
have
been
using
them
daily
for
about
months
place
one
in
my
ear
prior
to
my
daily
shower
and
have
one
in
there
continuously
until
late
in
the
evening
am
listening
to
music
and
talk
radio
all
day
with
the
occasional
phone
conservation
thrown
in
find
it
very
convenient
to
take
one
earbud
out
and
place
the
opposite
one
in
throughout
the
day
occasionally
do
use
both
simultaneously
when
listening
to
music
and
am
very
delighted
with
the
exceptional
quality
of
sound
did
have
minor
issue
and
pasonomi
acted
very
swiftly
and
professional
in
resolving
the
issuei
highly
recommend
these
to
anyone
looking
for
midpriced
quality
bluetooth
ear
buds
got
these
for
my
boyfriend
and
he
instantly
fell
in
love
with
them
the
charging
case
is
so
convenient
and
the
earbuds
fit
perfectlywe
were
pleasantly
surprised
to
learn
that
by
tapping
the
earbuds,
you
can
use
all
the
functions
without
having
to
touch
your
phone
next
track,
previous
track,
volume,
answer/decline
calls
and
pause
musici
will
be
purchasing
pair
for
myself
soon
these
are
perfect
for
just
about
anyone
:
have
purchased
numerous
earphones
for
gym
use
this
is
by
far
the
best
in
all
aspectscomfort
level
unlike
other
ear
pod
design
which
falls
our
very
easily
this
one
definitely
stays
in
ears
and
it
extremely
comfortable
for
long
hour
usesound
quality
is
comparable
to

the

great;
no

only
two
dislikes
can
think
of
are
they
do
become
slightly
uncomfortable
after
several
hours,
and
it's
impossible
to
hear
anything
while
eating
however,
those
are
minor
annoyances
when
compared
to
the
great
quality
and
ridiculously
good
price
of
these
earbuds
we
are
an
iphone
and
android
home
the
earbuds
worked
great
with
bothmy
hubby
the
android
user
ended
up
swiping
them
from
me
happy
to
buy
second
pairi
will
start
with
the
cons
as
that
list
is
much
shorter:0
not
great
for
talking

free0
had
couple
issues
with
quality

and
could
not
determine
if
it
was
the

my
phone
or

experienced
"delays"
or
cutting

charging
stayed
charged
for
whole
work
day
and
was
great
outside
doing
yard
work
got
these
about
month
ago
and
charged
them
up
use
them
every
couple
of
days
for
about
two
hours
each
time
then
pop
them
back
in
their
case
to
recharge
haven't
had
to
charge
the
case
again
yet
think
the
sound
quality
is
good
they
also
stay
in
my
ears
really
well
i've
had
trouble
with
other
earbuds
not
staying
put
but
these
stay
pretty
well
walk
briskly
on
the
treadmill
and
ride
stationary
bike
and
am
able
to
watch
netflix
while
doing
it
the
sound
is
clear
and
they
stay
in
would
definitely
recommend
tried
to
find
decent
pair
of
cheaper
ear
plugs
the
battery
concept
on
these
is
their
greatest
feature
but
the
usability
isn't
worth
it
i'm
always
having
trouble
when
switching
between
devices
and
when
try
to
do
that
only
one
of
the
two
earbuds
will
switch,
and
the
other
will
connect
but
never
play
sound
then
get
to
play
the
tap
tap
game
for
minutes
trying
to
reset
the
earphones
and
pray
they
link
up
to
each
other
these
earplugs
are
good
in
theory,
but
unless
they're
only
going
to
be
used
for
one
device
with
'alright'
sound
quality,
wouldn't
consider
getting
them
again
got
to
say
i'm
extremely
impressed
with
these
headphones
however
you
have
to
change
the
rubber
inserts
to
get
the
best
sound
quality
and
noise
cancellation
and
that
means
that
you
might
not
necessarily
use
the
ones
it
brought,
you
might
have
to
use
other
rubber
inserts
from
other
headsets
like
sony
or
samsung
or
whatnot
as
long
as
they
fit
they
do
exactly
what
they
say
they
are
meant
to
do
use
for
working
out
and
the
only
time
they
might
get
little
sensitive
for
motion
is
when
do
sit
ups,
heck
i've
even
showered
with
them
and
they
work
just
fine
however
the
water
will
mess
with
the
settings
like
volume
or
pause
the
music
to
be
expected
guess
the
battery
case
charge
it
one
time
and
it
last
you
about
week
depends
on
use
it
is
fair
to
say
that
it
was
good
buy
because
it
has
been
more
than
months
and
they
still
work
great
takes
some
time
for
your
ears
to
get
used
to
it,
but
is
pretty
decent
noise
cancellation
but
only
use
one
earbud
because
of
policy
at
work
and
the
sound
quality
is
decent
it's
not
heavy
on
the
bass,
but
that's
perfect
for
me
doesn't
fall
out
easily
and
doesn't
hurt
my
earsi
will
say
the
battery
life
was
advertised
as
~0
hours
per
full
charge,
but
personally
have
seen
it
last
hours
on
my
average
use
with
constant
music
playing
imagine
it
lasts
longer
if
you're
only
listening
to
podcasts
or
have
some
intermittent
breaks,
so
guess
it
makes
sensethe
battery
pack
that
it
comes
with
lasts
really
long
time
and
think
it
charges
the
headphones
fast,
so
very
good
haven't
used
it
for
charging
phone
yet,
but
that's
neat
featureoverall,
great
product
for
the
price
happy
with
my
first
wireless
headphone
purchase
:
couldn't
give
these
full
stars
only
because
there
is
almost
no
bass
to
these
that
being
said,
these
are
great
little
headphones
for
my
purposes
plan
to
use
them
for
long
flights
to
listen
to
audio
books
so
bass
is
not
an
issue
the
one
selling
point
that
made
me
purchase
these
was
the
ability
to
use
one
side
while
the
other
is
charging
perfect
for
listening
on
plane
for
hour
flight
the
allintheear
option
for
wireless
headphones
is
something
that
usually
concerns
me
as
comfort
is
usually
sacrificed
that
isn't
the
case
with
this
set
providing
easy
to
install
ear
comfort
pads
that
can
easily
be
swapped
out
for
different
wearers,
you
hardly
know
you
have
these
earbuds
in
the
sound
quality
is
spot
on
love
that
you
know
these
are
paired
with
the
simple
command
check
the
charging
unit
is
compact
and
easy
to
use
do
wish
there
was
longer
charging
cable
overall,
great
price,
great
material
construction,
great
concept
quality:they
feel
solid
even
though
it
is
plastic
they're
kind
of
light
but
it's
nice
in
the
ear
like
nothing's
weighing
you
downfit:the
fit
is
just
ok
it
hasn't
fallen
out
of
my
ears
when
shake
my
head
but
there's
something
lacking
in
the
fit
that
makes
me
feel
confident
that
these
will
stay
in
maybe
because
they
feel
light
in
the
ear
use
the
middle
size
silicon
ear
tipssound
quality:mids
are
good
can
hear
vocals
very
clearly
the
bass
is
there
but
they're
not
as
bass
heavy
as
feel
like
people
are
saying
they
don't
rumble
highs
are
pretty
good
nothing
to
rave
about
volume
innoise
cancelation:they
do
good
job
when
music
is
playing
but
if
yobattery
case:the
battery
case
is
kind
of
large
nothing
you'd
be
putting
in
your
pant's
pockets
but
definitely
something
you'd
put
in
your
backpackoverall:these
are
cheap
option
for
true
wireless
ear
buds
for
the
gym
when
work
out
sound
quality
is
not
always
on
my
mind
so
the
fact
that
these
are
decent
is
plus
no
wires
are
great
wouldn't
carry
these
all
day
unless
knew
would
be
carry
my
backpack
too
for
the
set
that
bought,
if
you
keep
your
phone
in
your
pocket
and
look
straight
aheadthese
ear
buds
work
greatmy
set
tho
will
lose
connection
for
second
if
you
turn
your
head
to
the
left,
not
so
much
to
the
right
but
primarily
only
when
you
turn
to
the
left
not
sure
if
the
set
feels
like
it
losing
connection
and
then
reestablishes
it
has
all
the
different
ear
pieces
but
some
of
them
look
very
similar
so
don
mix
them
up
ride
my
bike
with
them
on
and
kept
my
phone
in
my
back
back
and
had
to
switch
it
back
to
my
pocket
cuz
kept
losing
connectionthey
definitely
keep
the
sound
out
when
you
are
listening
to
them
but
ve
received
complaints
when
using
them
as
microphone
when
talking
to
someone
outside
where
the
outside
noise
seems
to
muffle
or
sound
out
your
voiceoverall
this
product
is
ok
but
wouldn
purchase
againi
would
want
something
that
doesn
lose
connection
when
you
are
being
active
so
bought
several
earbuds
for
the
family
and
chose
this
one
for
myself
since
it's
white
there
weren't
many
white
earbuds
out
there
anyways,
know
these
wireless
ones
don't
work
well
all
the
time
but
this
one
is
working
great
so
far
always
update
my
review
if
hate
them
for
any
reason
so
will
but
for
now,
sound
is
great
and
the
connection
was
very
easy
impressed
with
these
earbuds
have
been
hesitant
to
try
pair
because
was
worried
they
would
fall
out
of
my
ear
and
then
be
hard
to
find,
but
these
stay
put
and
it
it
hasn't
been
problem
sound
quality
is
good
when
talking
on
my
cell
phone,
other
people
can
hear
me
fine
paired
easily
with
my
cell
phone
the
only
trouble
have
is
using
the
earbud
itself
to
change
the
volume,
it
has
been
easier
for
me
to
just
use
the
cell
phone
for
that
purpose,
but
it
rarely
needs
adjusted
so
not
big
deal
sound
quality
and
noise
cancellation
is
excellent
for
battery
life,
use
them
for
at
least
an
hour
every
day
and
as
long
as
you
store
them
in
their
case
and
remember
to
charge
it
at
least
once
month
you
are
golden
their
range
between
them
and
the
bluetooth
device
is
also
quite
goodonly
issue
note
stopping
stars
is
that
if
very
quickly
either
move
my
phone
away
or
towards
the
earbuds
or
quickly
shake
my
head
side
to
side
they
disconnect
for
second
before
reconnectingfantastic
first
purchase
for
those
interested
in
wireless
headphones
these
did
work
for
me
right
out
of
the
box,
but
that
was
the
last
time
after
that
they
simply
would
not
pair
with
each
other,
nor
with
my
phone,
save
for
occasionally
one
at
time
the
one
time
they
did
work
for
me,
the
sound
quality
was
very
subpar
virtually
nonexistent
bass
reproduction
purchased
pair
of
the
tranya
brand,
which
for
about
the
same
price
are
much
nicer
they
actually
pair
consistently
and
have
very
nice
sound
quality
it's
odd
in
that
they
seem
like
virtually
the
same
product,
but
one
is
definitely
superior
to
the
other
im
very
pleased
with
this,
had
always
use
iphones
but
didn
wanted
to
invest
on
airpods
because
wanted
to
be
able
to
use
this
ear
pods
with
other
devices
they
are
great
had
used
them
with
my
phone,
tv,
tablet
and
they
all
pair
without
any
trouble
use
this
everyday
at
work
usually
one
at
time
so
can
hear
whats
happening
in
the
office
battery
last
about
hours
so
switch
to
the
other
and
im
always
have
one
charged
and
ready
to
use
sound
quality
is
excellent,
they
stay
on
my
ear
while
walk
around,
bent
or
even
showered
with
on
on
lol
love
that
the
case
works
as
power
bank
to
charge
your
phone
it
had
save
me
few
times
when
my
phone
is
about
to
die
it
definitely
worth
the
money
first
off
it's
obvious
that
they
engineered
this
package
everything
makes
sense,
fits
well,
and
is
quite
functional
like
that
the
stem
from
the
main
body
of
the
earbud
is
longer
than
with
my
last
pair
different
manufacturer
which
gives
me
much
better
fit
have
large
ear
canals,
and
the
fit
gives
me
much
better
bass
response
without
having
to
monkey
around
with
them
my
only
issue
has
been
linking
every
so
often
my
phone
doesn't
see
the
earbuds
when
take
them
out
of
the
case,
easily
remedied
by
turning
off
bt,
putting
the
earbuds
back
and
then
when
you
take
them
out
again
and
turn
bt
back
on
all
is
well
look,
the
things
have
to
link
to
each
other
and
then
to
the
phone
think
this
kind
of
issue
is
to
be
blamed
as
much
on
bluetooth
as
the
manufacturer
they
never
have
failed
to
work
after
this
"reboot"
heartily
recommend,
these
are
an
excellent
value
these
are
the
best
earbuds
have
ever
bought
i've
had
airpods
i've
had
few
others
that
ive
spent
some
money
on
but
these
plus
the
price
was
great
as
well
and
so
well
worth
it
it
honestly
takes
out
any
noise
in
the
background
so
be
careful
if
not
paying
attention
because
you
cant
hear
anything
outside
of
your
music
the
sound
quality
is
amazing
and
crisp
and
loud
love
it
love
it
best
earphones
have
ever
bought
promise
you
will
not
be
disappointed
to
be
fair,
i'll
start
with
the
goodthe
charge
indicator
lights
in
the
case
are
very
nicethey
pair
really
easythe
fit
and
comfort
were
finenow,
the
badthe
sound
quality
was
awful
no
other
way
to
say
it
think
of
the
cheapest
headphones
you've
ever
listened
to,
and
these
are
themwhile
like
that
you
can
adjust
the
volume
from
the
buds,
more
times
than
not
would
activate
siri
while
trying
to
change
the
volume
very
annoying
perhaps
there
is
way
to
disable
this
from
happening,
it
didn't
matter
because
the
sound
was
so
poori
almost
feel,
because
of
so
many
positive
reviews,
that
these
were
somehow
defective
not
wanting
to
risk
having
to
return
second
set,
just
returned
them
for
refund
working
well
so
far
seems
like
good
build
quality
only
complaint
is
that
sometimes
have
to
unpair/pair
on
my
note
quality
sound
and
contrary
to
what
read
in
earlier
reviews,
get
stereo
audio
with
phone
calls
not
sure
if
there
was
change
to
the
firmware
not
quite
noise
reduction
but
pretty
close
i've
paired
to
multiple
devices
and
they
seem
to
work
well
all
setup
done
with
out
rtfm
my
only
fear
is
losing
them
since
i've
dropped
them
few
times
not
being
careful
with
them
purchased
this
item
for
my
son
he
has
been
using
them
for
months
now
with
no
issues
which
is
great
the
sound
quality
is
amazing
while
listening
to
music
but
isn't
very
good
for
phone
calls
just
recently
the
charging
dock
for
the
earbuds
quit
working
we've
tried
everything
to
try
to
get
them
to
work
and
nothing
this
product
comes
with
month
warranty
so
looked
for
number
or
web
page
to
contact
them
and
have
found
nothing
the
info
on
the
item
tells
you
to
click
onto
link
which
then
takes
you
to
another
page
telling
you
to
visit
their
page
again,
after
doing
all
that
still
come
up
empty
handed
with
any
kind
of
information
to
contact
the
manufacturer
for
the
warranty
if
anyone
has
dealt
with
this
company
please
send
me
any
info
to
contact
them
thanks
received
these
and
was
excited
to
check
them
out
am
always
misplacing
my
earbuds
and
wanted
pair
to
leave
at
work
these
will
work
out
perfectly
they
come
in
great
carrying
case/charger
they
block
out
all
the
sounds
need
them
to
at
work
very
easy
to
connect
to
my
iphone
and
ipad
they
were
exactly
as
described
on
the
listing
i've
tried
multiple
different
types
of
bluetooth
headphones
in
the
past
few
years
love
this
style
would
definitely
recommend
we
bought
these
for
my
stepson
who
broke
his
last
pair
of
headphones
and
wanted
to
switch
to
earbuds
we
did
not
want
to
spend
ton
of
money
so
decided
on
these
he
has
been
using
these
now
for
couple
of
weeks
and
loves
them
he
uses
them
all
the
time,
with
school
work
and
also
just
to
listen
to
music
our
house
can
be
little
crazy
and
noisy,
he
says
that
these
completely
cut
out
the
noise
and
have
great
sound
also
the
is
and
had
no
issues
setting
these
up
and
getting
them
connected
great
buy
for
the
price
much
better
than
the
iphone

headset

everything
in

wonderful

and
beautiful

you
don't
need

be
near
the

signal
the
alcanse
is
very
big
the
battery
charges
completely
super
fast
the
battery
lasts
long
enough
to
listen
all
day
and
night
until
half
the
next
day
compared
the
sound
with
friend's
iphone
device
and
was
impressed
with
the
quality
that
surpasses
the
iphone
brand
much
better
than
others
with
big
brands
in
the
market
would
buy
times
again
recommend
to
all
my
friends
the
price
is
super
fair
would
pay
even
more
for
this
wonderful

was
the
best
purchase
made
on
amazon
mi

looked
into
these
ear
buds
at
the
recommendation
of
friend
and
they
did
not
disappoint
the
packaging
is
sharp
looking
with
nice,
compact
charging
case
and
carrying
bag
it
took
few
hours
to
recharge
the
ear
buds
the
ear
buds
are
comfortable
to
wear
and
quite
intuitive
and
easy
to
use
an
audio
message
will
play
when
connecting,
low
battery,
etc
they
were
very
easy
to
connect
and
get
started
the
sound
while
listening
to
music
is
good
quality,
though
the
base
could
be
better
the
range
is
fairly
good
while
could
walk
around
the
house
without
my
phone,
there
was
little
interference
when
reached
about
feet
away
with
walls
in
between,
but
overall
was
satisfied
with
the
range
the
microphone
was
poor
in
quality
when
making
phone
call,
the
person
on
the
other
end
of
the
line
can
barely
hear
the
ear
bud
user
overall,
for
the
price
this
is
great
product
although
there
are
better
quality
products
on
the
market,
you
still
get
very
good

recently
lost
pair
of
wireless
headphones
so
went
online
to
find
new
pair
and
looked
at
some
of
the
reviews
couldn
remember
the
last
ones
bought
so
was
just
browsing
saw
decent
amount
of
good
reviews
so
purchased
these
first
off,
it
pairs
very
quickly
secondly
the
fit
is
quite
nice
and
like
how
there
are
different
sizes
of
earbuds
to
fit
your
ears
the
sound
quality
is
nice
but
there
isn
much
bass
unfortunately
but
for
working
out
these
are
perfect
because
they
re
snug
and
lightweight
and
sound
decent
enough
the
downfall
in
comparison
to
the
last
wireless
headphones
had
is
that
there
is
no
control
on
the
earbud
itself
my
last
pair
you
could
click
button
on
the
outer
part
of
the
device
while
you
were
wearing
it
to
pause
and
skip
if
someone
spoke
to
you
for
example,
and
you
wanted
to
hear
them
this
pair
guessing
you
can
only
control
with
your
phone
however,
that
being
said,
this
pair
has
power
bank
for
you
to
charge
not
only
your
headphones,
but
your
phone
as
well
so
thought
that
was
pretty
cool
overall
decent
headphones
if
you
re
looking
to
be
frugal
and
not
spend
over
$0
when
drive,
take
the
call
with
the
cell
phone,
policeman
give
me
the
ticket
freely
but
using
bluetooth,
talk
with
freely
in
drivingwhen
am
in
it
open
office,
am
worried
my
boss
misunderstanding
when
listen
the
music,
now
use
bluetooth,
can
listen
the
music
without
cord
inconvenientlynow
pasonomi
of
bluetooth
take
me
new
feeling,
high
qualty,
good
appearnce,
water
protection,
easily
handle
with
automatically
appearing
on
your
smartphone,
incredible
sound
qualityi
recommend
it
to
you
seriously
these
are
ok
battery
life
is
excellent
noise
cancellation
was
decent,
but
they
picked
up
lot
of
surrounding
noise
for
the
person
on
the
other
end
wish
the
volume
would
have
gone
higher
on
them
it
was
sometimes
hard
to
hear
even
with
my
phone
volume
all
the
way
up
they're
little
bulky
in
the
ear,
but
they
did
still
in
the
ear
for
the
most
part
found
them
to
get
little
uncomfortable
after
extra
time
on
the
phone,
so
you
may
want
to
consider
something
else
if
you're
on
the
phone
lot
for
work
the
signal
also
would
cut
out
randomly
and
disconnect
or
just
play
this
scrambled
signal
went
another
product,
and
am
stuck
with
these
because
it
was
past
the
return
date
purchased
set
of
these
about
year
ago
for
my
husband,
he
wears
them
at
work
and
said
they
were
good
for
that
got
set
for
myself
recently
and
mostly
like
to
use
them
when
mow
the
lawn
on
riding
mower,
and
can
easily
hear
the
music
still
they
fit
just
fine,
have
never
fallen
out
and
they
are
easy
to
link
to
my
phone
and
recharge
wish
the
battery
life
was
little
longer
as
sometimes
have
to
recharge
them
before
i'm
done
with
my
yard
work
also
have
to
drive
my
vehicle
with
windows
open
due
to
no
air
conditioner
at
the
moment
which
is
very
noisy,
so
use
them
in
the
car
so
that
can
hear
the
podcasts
enjoy
as
drive
overall,
they
are
very
good
quality
for
the
money
and
highly
recommend
them
am
ordering
another
set
for
my
son,
wish
they
had
different
colors
so
we
don't
get
ours
mixed
up
though
i've
recently
ordered
and
got
these
earbuds
since
my
old
blue
tooth
ones
died
wanted
pair
that
was
true
wireless
and
with
little
hassle
to
be
honest,
there
are
lot
of
earbuds
like
these
and
just
chose
the
one
that
fit
my
price
range
when
got
these,
was
very
disappointed
with
how
the
sound
was
when
playing
music
it
had
little
to
no
bass
and
was
extremely
flathowever,
realized
that
the
actual
earbuds
were
perfectly
fine
and
were
playing
quality
music
the
problem
lies
with
the
silicon
tips
they're
way
too
small
so
lot
of
the
noise
will
leak
out
when
playing
music
or
listening
to
anything
even
the
largest
silicon
tip
they
give
you
is
not
big
enough
my
recommendation
to
make
these
earbuds
sound
good
or
better
is
to
get
different
pair
of
silicon
tips
that
are
larger
and
pretty
much
fill
your
ear
don't
worry
if
they're
little
big
and
the
earbuds
don't
charge
when
the
lid
is
open
the
closed
lid
will
kind
of
give
it
little
push
down
so
the
earbuds
charge
properlypersonally
used
some
spare
tips
from
my
skull
candy
method
earbuds
but
you
can
use
whatever
tips
that
fit
your
preference
the
feature
ratings
are
for
the
base
kit
the
earbuds
provide
but
after
changing
tips,
it
felt
like
actually
paid
for
something
good
and
not
some
cheap
earbuds
battery
life
really
is
just
hours
and
it
takes
super
long
to
recharge,
around
the
same
time
that
it
takes
to
turn
off
~0hrs
my
earphones
glitched
on
me
showing
lots
of
static
and
in
the
beginning
they
would
not
turn
on
after
while
they
did
begin
to
turn
on
but
then
few
months
like
later,
the
time
they
took
for
the
battery
of
earphones
to
drain
was
less
than
hours
even
now
as
use
them,
have
them
fully
charged
but
they
only
work
for
an
hour
before
the
earphone
operator
asks
me
to
charge
the
earphones
again
take
fault
in
not
sending
them
back
on
time
since
did
not
know
if
the
warranty
would
cover
these
issues
or
if
they
would
blame
me
yes
it
took
almost
year
to
review
these
earphones
but
feel
its
the
best
way
to
answer
honestly
have
owned
lot
of
headphones
but
have
to
say
these
are
the
cheapest
and
best
in
my
opinion
as
soon
as
got
them
and
paired
them
to
my
device
loved
them
the
battery
lasts
long
time,
the
audio
is
loud
and
clear,
tap
to
play
and
pause
love
everything
about
these
headphones
highly
recommend
them
to
anyone
and
will
continue
to
use
them
till
inevitably
break
them
somehow
because
i'm
clumsy
but
none
the
less
great
headphones
this
instructions
are
simple,
and
worked
well
for
pairing
once
complete
the
pulled
up
one
of
my
favorite
songs
to
test,
and
was
blown
away
by
the
sound
quality,
rich,
deep,
clear
the
ability
to
charge
in
the
case,
with
out
wall
power
is
nice
as
well
tried
charging
my
s0
with
the
case,
and
was
little
disappointed
it
only
added
about
0%,
but
if
you
just
need
little
more
power,
this
will
do
it
for
you
i'd
also
be
careful
in
some
environments
wearing
them,
as
you
have
no
audio
situational
awareness,
wish
they
also
had
noise
cancelling
feature
to
hear
whats
going
on
around
you
am
enjoying
the
headphones
very
much
they
can
sometimes
be
spotty
in
connectivity
while
running
or
doing
any
fast
physical
activitythe
case
holds
good
charge
though,
and
like
how
they
connect
automatically
to
my
phone
would
not
recommend
them
for
running,
as
they
become
slippery
when
wet
and
can
fall
out
of
the
ear
the
connection
to
your
phone
also
seems
to
phase
in
and
out
when
moving
quicklythey
are
very
high
quality
for
the
price
charge
lasts
long
time,
and
with
the
case,
you
can
go
for
long
time
without
recharging
have
been
using
mine
on
and
off
at
work
for
about
week
and
have
not
had
to
recharge
the
case
yet
like
the
product
and
the
consistency
of
the
material
originally
ordered
the
black
pair
but
got
the
white
pair
in
the
mail
and
wasn
sure
if
it
was
worth
it
to
submit
as
return
since
wanted
to
use
them
already
decided
to
wait
few
months
before
posting
my
review
they
work
pretty
great
for
the
first
months
unfortunatly
sad
that
my
earphones
are
starting
to
break
apart
and
it
hurts
my
ears
take
good
care
of
them
but
the
right
earphones
plastic
glue
seems
to
have
come
off
and
it
rubs
my
ear
incorrectly
other
than
this
they
age
great
earphones
sound
is
great
and
it
fits
more
or
less
comfortable
wish
had
the
option
to
return
or
exchange
them
like
at
store
for
some
new
ones
or
ones
that
don
hurt
my
ears
will
likely
keep
using
them
until
can
anymore
it
worked
really
nicely
at
first,
but
then
all
of
sudden
it
stopped
charging
properly
got
mine
months
ago
and
it
worked
great
good
sound
qualitynow,
it
starts
blinking
once
meaning
that
it
is
low
battery
and
put
it
to
charge
leave
it
there
for
long
time,
but
then
try
it
and
it
is
basically
dead
if
leave
it
the
whole
night,
it
might
get
to
two/three
dots
but
it
still
doesn
hold
lot
of
change
anyways
think
the
charging
mechanism
is
broken
can
still
charge
my
headphones
overnight,
but
then
case
doesn
recharge
fast
enough
during
the
dayi
do
not
know
if
received
malfunctioning
one,
or
if
they
all
stop
working
after
about
months
i'm
no
audiophile
so
can't
comment
on
sq
it
sounds
sufficient
to
me,
but
the
buds
fall
short
after
trying
them
out
for
weeks
they
mainly
come
down
to
connection
range
and
fit
connection
range
is
very
limited
it
started
losing
connection
being
walls
away
from
the
source
fit
is
just
bad
none
of
the
silicon
tips
helps
then
realized
it
was
the
buds
design
that
hurts
my
ears
because
of
the
poor
fit,
they
never
felt
secure
and
were
constantly
on
the
verge
of
falling
out
on
the
positive
side,
the
touch
controls
are
intuitive
and
work
as
advertised
received
these
yesterday
they
were
already
charged
just
followed
the
simple
directions
and
had
them
synced
and
connected
to
my
phone
quickly
am
not
techy
so
was
relieved
that
it
was
easy
listened
to
music
all
evening
they
were
left
in
the
charger
last
night
have
used
them
all
day
with
no
battery
problem
phone
calls
are
easy
to
take
love
that
it
has
caller
id
and
speaks
the
number
they
seem
to
have
long
bluetooth
range
sound
is
clear
with
no
distortions
don't
have
to
worry
about
pulling
out
any
wires
and
can
easily
do
about
anything
with
them
on
they
fit
well
and
snug
they
have
several
different
size
attachments
to
ensure
fit
this
is
my
first
wireless
pair
and
am
very
pleased
with
them
haven't
found
anything
dislike
about
them
would
definitely
recommend
them
purchased
these
recently
not
expecting
too
much
for
the
pricethey
worked
beautifully,
at
some
point
one
stopped
working
tried
to
correct
it
to
no
avail
contacted
customer
service
via
email
they
gave
information
they
may
work
to
activate
the
left
one
it
did
not
emailed
customer
service
again,
they
sent
me
new
ones
,
no
problemcustomer
service
was
quick
and
thoughtful
will
purchase
more
for
family
and
friends
holidays
are
rapidly
approaching
am
music
producer
who
uses
ath
m0x's
as
my
main
type
of
headphone
when
received
these
wireless
earbuds,
was
shocked,
at
the
quality
these
had
coming
straight
out
of
the
box
they
feel
comfortable
in
my
ears,
and
i'm
able
to
wear
them
all
day
long
the
noise
cancellation
makes
the
listening
experience
feel
very
personal,
and
did
not
feel
cheated
for
my
money
at
all
the
sound
quality
is
great
for
the
money
that's
why
gave
it
star,
the
noise
cancellation
is
very
effective,
which
also
gave
stars
the
only
drawback
was
the
battery
life
lasting
for
hours
each
earplug
using
them
separately
gives
hours
of
battery
life,
and
there
is
portable
charger
that
allows
for
charges
that
each
take
around
an
hour
for
each,
or
both
headphones
in
my
opinion,
it's
the
best
feature
because
it
allows
you
to
listen
to
music
all
day
for
days
straight,
without
having
to
plug
anything
into
wall
these
are
awesome,
but
battery
life
is
shorter
than
expected
have
trouble
charging
the
right
earpiece
and
have
to
constantly
push
them
into
the
case
to
continue
recharging
they
are
awesome
when
fully
charged
sound
quality
at
full
charge
it
wonderful,
and
noise
canceling
works
very
well,
but
not
0%,
which
is
fine
at
this
price
overall,
good
product
for
the
price,
just
headache
to
keep
charged
both
love
and
hate
these
headphones
use
them
almost
every
day
and
have
waited
to
post
my
review
they
are
game
changer
for
me
after
using
wired
headphones
my
whole
lifepros:the
battery
life
is
very
good
and
charging
is
fasti
dropped
the
left
one
in
bucket
of
water
in
the
first
week
and
it
still
works
finecomfortablegood
fitcons:the
right
ear
bud
is
much
quieter
than
the
left
for
some
reasonthe
audio
will
cut
out
constantly
if
you
move
your
head
around
too
much
it's
incredibly
annoying
at
the
gymthey
sometimes
have
difficulty
connecting
to
my
phone
or
randomly
disconnectingconclusion:i
would
have
spent
more
on
nicer
pair
that
doesn't
constantly
cut
out,
but
they
are
ok
for
the
price
was
little
hesitant
in
making
this
purchase
because
have
tried
various
different
wireless
bluetooth
earbuds
and
many
of
them
just
did
not
live
up
to
their
steller
reviews
but
went
ahead
and
bought
them
anyway
and
thought
would
try
them
outso
glad
did
these
were
definitely
worth
the
purchase
and
think
they
are
an
amazing
price
for
what
they
are
they
are
awesome
quality
and
work
better
than
had
imagined
dont
have
single
complaint
if
you
are
on
the
fence
about
it,
definitely
make
the
purchase
everyone
needs
at
least
one
good
pair
of
earbuds
bought
these
for
my
kids
for
christmas
and
for
long
hour
road
trip
think
they
were
lost
before
we
made
it
to
key
west
battery
life
is
good,
but
they
could
not
keep
them
in
they
kept
falling
out
of
their
ears
they
used
headbands
to
keep
them
in
sound
quality
was
good,
but
when
they
keep
falling
out
guess
the
sound
quality
is
mute
the
small
charging
case
it
pretty
darn
sweet
tho
very
nice
touch
sound
quality
is
ok,
but
so
is
the
one
on
my
default
earbuds
that
came
with
my
phone,
that
as
good
as
you
ll
get
with
earbuds
so
there
that
the
fit
is
ok
too,
actually
nice
and
firm
but
not
uncomfortable,
my
real
problem
is
with
the
controls
for
doing
anything
beyond
pause/play,
it
virtually
impossible
and
the
most
infuriating
from
it
all
is
when
you
make
phone
call
and
want
to
take
them
off
to
use
your
phone
for
the
call,
0%
of
the
time
you
ll
end
up
hanging
up
the
call
and
if
it
so
happens
you
called
your
bank
and
used
your
earbuds
to
hold
on
line
for
0mins
just
to
hangup
the
second
you
re
turn
comes
up
and
eant
to
talk
to
the
other
person
well
you
get
my
point
ll
keep
these
to
use
at
the
office
only
while
work
and
charge
my
phone
since
apple
solved
the
jack
plug
problem
for
all
of
us
will
keep
this
simple
tried
couple
of
wireless
earbuds
that
were
more
expensive
and
they
simply
kept
falling
out
have
not
had
issues
with
these
falling
out

with

claim
is

if
you
have
nice
seal
with
the
rubber
cups
then
the
outside
sound
is
just
low
rumblethere
are
no
dislikes
so
far
this
is
the
first
set
of
ear
buds
that
have
decided
to
keep
listen
to
lot
of
podcasts
and
interviews
so
am
excited
to
add
these
to
my
headset
collection
very
satisfied
for
the
quality
for
the
price
there
are
few
weird
nuances
that
that
can't
figure
out
for
instance
the
button
on
the
side
turns
on
the
lights
to
show
you
how
much
battery
is
left
however,
this
light
turns
on
sporadically,
on
its
own,
and
can't
get
it
off
seems
to
happen
more
the
more
charged
it
is
doesn't
seem
to
affect
it
in
any
way,
maybe
drains
battery
more
as
power
brick
it
doesn't
do
much
as
far
as
charging
goes
it
will
charge
my
iphone
one
time,
and
use
all
of
the
battery
if
you
just
use
it
for
the
ear
buds,
it
can
charge
those
up
like
times
before
another
charge
is
needed
obsessed
with
these
headphones
use
them
almost
everyday
the
little
charger
box
is
easy
to
open
and
charges
pretty
fast
say
they
last
about
three
hours
of
continuous
music
and
takes
about
min
to
full
charge
btw
these
are
estimates
ve
gone
through
couple
of
different
bluetooth
headphones
like
nenrent
and
these
are
my
favorite
purchased
these
with
intentions
of
using
while
run
based
on
all
the
reviews
first
time
used
it
straight
out
of
the
packaging
the
right
ear
bud
had
total
diminished
sound
quality
like
it
was
stuck
on
the
lowest
setting,
immediately
messaged
the
company
who
gave
me
run
around
and
trouble
shooting
steps
back
and
forth
emails
until
they
finally
sent
me
another
pair
great
right
the
new
pair
has
the
exact
same
problem
after
uses
,
to
top
it
all
off
inside
the
packaging
of
the
new
pair
there
was
card
that
said
congratulations
winner
and
instructions
to
email
so
did
out
of
curiosity
when
the
replied
they
said
to
receive
free
pair
write
star
review
and
screen
shot
the
message
and
send
it
back
to
this
email
to
get
free
pair
well
now
know
why
there
so
many
positive
reviews
because
they
were
bought
save
your
money
this
is
garbage
the
earbuds
are
great,
they
worked
fine
and
have
good
audio
and
noise
canceling,
while
they
lasterone
thing
it
failed
on,
personally,
it
was
little
invasive
and
uncomfortable
on
the
earthen,
the
right
earbud
died
completely
after
months,
and
the
left
earbud
start
failing
and
couldn't
hear
anymore,
even
they
seem
to
be
turned
on,
cannot
hear
anything,
that
was
after
monthsso
that's
my
view,
wish
they
would
work
longer
but
that's
my
rating
based
on
my
experience
hope
it
was
only
my
earbuds
specifically
and
not
all
deployments
of
this
product
this
is
simple
to
use
product
with
great
features
the
earbuds
are
comfortable
and
stay
securely
in
your
ears
with
lots
of
movement,
like
running
and
jumping
the
charging
case
is
fantastic
super
convenient
the
battery
life
is
better
than
expected
my
teenager
keeps
trying
to
take
them,
but
won
give
them
up
maybe
he
needs
his
own
for
christmas
this
may
be
too
early
of
review
as
have
only
had
them
for
about
days
but
i've
used
them
every
day
and
they
are
great
wouldn't
call
the
sound
quality
or
call
quality
of
these
high
end,
however
they
are
not
bad
either
setting
these
up
was
as
easy
as
possible
and
using
them
quickly
whenever
need
to
is
super
easy
as
well
take
them
out
of
the
case
and
stick
them
in
your
ears
and
they
connect
automatically,
you'll
be
listening
to
your
music
in
less
than
seconds
the
touch
controls
work
well
also
am
pleasantly
surprised
with
how
nice
these
are
for
the
price
paid
will
update
this
if
have
any
trouble
with
these
but
so
far
am
very
pleased/impressed
with
their
quality
recently
researched
and
purchased
black
pair
of
these
wireless
earbuds
received
the
order
couple
months
ago
and
unfortunately
after
about
dozen
uses,
the
right
earbud
has
become
significantly
lower
in
sound
volume
than
the
left,
sometimes
not
working
at
alli
have
taken
care
of
this
product
and
have
no
issues
pairing
them
etc
but
this
makes
them
useless
to
only
listen
to
music
in
one
earprior
to
this
issue
was
very
satisfied
with
my
purchase
they
were
an
affordable
option
for
wireless
earbud,
and
they
worked
great
for
workouts
at
the
gymi
contacted
the
seller
over
week
ago
and
have
not
received
response
the
only
reason
regret
my
purchase
is
that
received
defective
pair
and
the
seller
has
not
attempted
to
solve
this
after
combing
over
the
reviews,
decided
to
roll
the
dice
and
see
if
these
guys
were
worth
it
guess
what,
they
were
heh
the
sound
quality
is
powerful;
incredibly
noise
canceling,
even
on
phone
calls
have
friend
who
is
critical
of
sound
quality
during
our
calls
he
actually
complains
about
how
much
sound
the
device
picks
up
while
in
the
grocery
store
on
the
phone
with
him
he
instructed
me
that
new
lane
had
just
opened
up
for
the
next
in
line
"sarah
line
four
just
open
up"
was
clueless
due
to
the
noise
canceling
abilities
he
jokes
that
when
i'm
running
someone
will
warn
me
of
loose
loin
and,
boom,
i'm
eaten
occasionally
there
is
slip
of
the
bud
when
suction
is
broken
but
that's
it
can
vigorously
shake
my
head
side
to
side
and
no
slippage
my
only
complaint
is
the
sensor
touch,
especially
to
end
phone
call
one
touch
of
either
bud
phone
call
ends
so
if
i'm
moving
my
hair,
accidentally
touch
it
or
adjusting,
call
ended
overall,
great
product
plus,
the
magnetic
case
is
cool
and
compact
first
impressions:
the
earbuds
fit
snugly
in
the
ear
am
pleasantly
surprised
by
its
noise
isolation
sound
is
okay
the
base
could
have
been
better
there
is
no
delay
between
sound
and
video
and
that
is
great
the
charging
case
looks
solidoverall
it
was
very
easy
to
setup
and
good
listening
experience
these
are
the
first
wireless
earbuds
that
i've
ever
bought
and
am
loving
ithere
are
some
pros
and
cons
i've
noticed
since
using
this
productcons:shorter
battery
life
than
other
mainstream
earbuds,
but
then
again,
bought
these
for
$0
so
that
was
to
be
expectedtapping
on
the
headphones
to
pause,
rewind
and
skip
through
songs
are
neat,
but
it
can
be
inconvenient
at
times
for
examples,
taps
on
the
earbud
may
only
register
as
0,
but
that
is
nothing
majorwhen
clumsily
drop
my
phone,
there
will
be
no
wires
to
save
itthats
all
for
the
cons,
so
farpros:i
can
now
beat
my
meat
without
the
wires
getting
in
my
way
im
seriouslouder
than
expected
but
thats
no
problem
for
mesound
quality
is
decent
definitely
better
than
some
headphones
out
in
the
market
in
this
price
rangefits
nicely
in
my
ear
due
to
the
wide
variety
of
tipsjust
the
convenience
of
having
no
wires
getting
in
the
way
is
bonus
itselfand
thats
it
folksi
also
used
samsung
s0+
to
pair
with
these
headphonesedit:
after
using
these
for
year,
they're
still
working
just
as
great
as
when
bought
them
have
not
bought
another
pair
since
though
the
battery
life
has
shortened
bit
due
to
frequent
use
over
the
year
definitely
worth
the
bucks
bought
them
with
love
pairing
up
this
bluetooth
earbuds
with
my
android
so
awesome
to
use
and
very
easy
to
pair
sounds
quality
is
good
enough
for
me
the
noise
cancellation
feature
is
ok,
but
don't
know
if
that
means
you
have
to
turn
up
the
volume
to
reach
noise
cancellation
levels
also
like
the
battery
charging
case
works
as
well
as
advertised
very
convenient
and
holds
the
earbuds
well
these
bluetooth
earbuds
are
great
price
for
good
productthe
packaging
was
good,
and
the
item
came
securely
packed
the
earbuds
came
in
nice
portable
case,
with
small
carry
bag
the
usb
cord
used
to
charge
the
case,
the
extra
ear
caps,
the
charging
case
all
fit
into
the
small
carry
bag
the
compact
design
of
the
charging
case
is
feature
appreciate
as
carry
many
items
in
my
pockets
and
purse
love
that,
if
needed,
can
also
charge
my
cell
phone
with
the
charging
casethe
earbuds
fit
snuggly,
and
there
are
several
options/sizes
to
choose
from
for
the
ear
caps
even
while
out
gardening,
or
jogging,
they
fit
snuggly
and
stay
in
placemy
house
has
several
different
devices
to
pair
with
pairing
was
simple
and
worked
well
with
all
our
devicescell
phones,
tablets,
ipads,
even
our
tvbattery
lifewith
three
kids
and
husband
who
loves
to
use
theseis
awesome
my
kids
use
these
in
the
car
when
we
travel
they
easily
keep
charge
for
four
hours
and
recharge
pretty
quickly
you
can
use
them
separately,
which
is
nice
if
they
are
watching
the
same
movie,
or
if
you
want
to
listen
to
music,
and
also
listen
to
the
kidsthe
sound
quality
overall
is
good
we
tried
many
platforms
we
used
different
cell
phones
to
test
the
sound
quality
from
each,
we
played
games
on
our
tablets
and
ipads,
and
we
used
them
for
music
as
we
did
gardening
and
jogging
overall,
the
sound
quality
was
pretty
good,
even
with
the
music
the
music
quality
does
not
register
below
hertz
so
for
bass
lovers,
this
might
be
an
issue
but
the
sound
was
still
high
qualityin
summary,
we
all
love
these
earbuds
the
ease
of
pairing
them,
sound
quality,
and
length
of
battery
life
make
these
good
price
and
good
product
was
needing
some
new
bluetooth
earbuds
and
didn
want
to
drop
bunch
of
money
on
some,
so
these
were
godsend
the
battery
life
is
great,
was
able
to
sit
and
watch
netflix/listen
to
music
for
nearly
hours
straight
they
block
good
amount
of
sound
and
sound
pretty
good
tooi
do
have
some
downsides
that
aren
too
major
for
some
cause
they
might
not
effect
them
as
much
for
me
ve
always
found
lot
of
in
ear
headphones
hurt
my
ears,
like
something
is
digging
into
them
slightly
but
only
ve
ever
had
this
problem
and
it
kinda
rare
with
these
aside
from
that,
the
only
true
downside
that
would
be
universal
is
how
easy
it
is
to
pause
audio
and
use
the
controls
if
you
aren
careful
and
that
the
rubber
bits
for
the
earbuds
are
kinda
on
the
small
and
shallow
end,
so
not
the
most
comfortable
for
people
with
larger
ears
like
me
still
good
though
you
get
what
you
pay
for
for
the
price
these
earbuds
are
fairly
decent
and
work
great
was
not
impressed
with
the
quality
of
the
charging
case
plastic
and
earbuds
they
feel
cheap
but
don
feel
like
they
would
break
have
had
these
for
days
and
have
only
had
one
problem
with
the
earbuds
not
playing
music
but
other
than
that,
the
pairing
and
accessibility
features
are
easy
to
use
and
fantastic
the
sound
quality
is
decent
in
high
pitches
but
the
bass
is
absolutely
trash
when
tampered
with
the
eq
on
spotify
to
amplify
the
bass,
the
speakers
crackled
bit
and
had
to
turn
it
back
down
the
fit
is
amazing
and
have
been
to
the
gym
with
no
problems
the
touch
sensor
is
not
very
responsive
and
you
have
to
tap
it
just
right
for
it
to
pause
or
skip
overall
great
product
for
the
price
but
if
you
are
looking
for
sound
quality
and
material
quality
look
for
something
little
higher
on
the
price
scale
was
skeptical
at
first
but
i'm
good
bought
these
at
first
the
fit
and
sounds
quality
were
bad
tired
the
different
tips
provided
but
they
didn't
seal
well
enough
out
if
they
did
it
would
hurt
my
ears
after
while
also
tired
different
tips
from
other
headphones
the
sounds
with
improved
but
it
still
hurt
my
ears
finally
landed
on
ones
like
the
link
below
they
had
to
be
modified
to
fit
in
the
case
but
it
worked
out
really
well
i'm
super
happy
with
the
sounds
and
comfort
nowhttps://wwwamazoncom/dp/b0zhjlv/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_apa_i_ttlbdb0ch0j0e
good
pair
of
bluetooth
headphones
found
out
by
trial
and
error
that
only
the
left
ear
bud
has
mic
to
pick
up
sound
when
on
phone
call
but
sound
quality
better
than
expected
the
instructions
are
descriptive
enough
but
there
is
broken
english
in
use
as
believe
this
is
an
asian
brand
or
something
not
the
best
for
phone
calls
have
to
speak
louder
than
i've
had
to
before
with
other
pairs
of
headphones
but
it's
not
terrible
touch
functionality
is
good
and
not
overly
sensitive
one
bad
thing
i'll
have
to
note
is
the
headphones
charging
case
isn't
the
most
secure
on
keeping
the
headphones
latched
to
the
charging
port
within
the
case
the
case
itself
is
solid
but
the
charging
port
for
the
headphones
you'll
have
to
make
sure
they
are
really
on
there
for
them
to
charge
at
least
in
my
experience
better
than
spending
twice
the
money
on
an
apple
product
purchased
these
for
$0
with
coupon
and
so
far
ve
run
miles
with
them,
sat
through
hour
tattoo
session
and
sat
around
and
watched
couple
netflix
shows
they
are
well
worth
the
money
if
sound
quality
is
not
critical
to
you
the
sound
is
all
high
frequencies,
very
aluminum
can
with
no
low
end
my
old
jabra
with
the
strap
between
the
ear
pieces
has
way
better
sound
and
the
same
battery
life,
but
they
were
times
the
cost
well
used
to
love
these
headphones
until
my
husband
stole
them
from
me
and
uses
them
at
work
he
chef
so
he
needed
something
that
was
handsfree
now
apparently
his
whole
kitchen
staff
wants
them
toowhen
was
using
them
they
fit
in
my
ear
so
easily
they
stayed
put
unlike
the
airpods
and
you
re
able
to
still
answer
calls
from
them
very
light
weight
and
easy
to
use,
great
sound
quality
looks
like
need
to
order
another
pairthe
best
part
has
been
the
customer
service
emailed
with
troubleshooting
question
and
got
the
nicest,
and
extremely
prompt
response
that
right
there
makes
world
of
difference
great
product,
great
customer
service
very
happy
with
my
purchaseand
apparently
so
is
my
chef
husband
not
great
sound,
but
you
wont
be
dissapointed
if
you
need
something
to
get
you
through
the
day
without
the
annoying
cables
in
the
way
wish
could
use
the
right
one
by
itself
while
being
able
to
store
the
left
one
in
the
case
to
re
charge
looks
like
this
is
only
possible
in
the
reverse
order
the
case
doubling
as
battery
pack
for
other
devices
is
useful
feature
absolutely
love
these
earbuds
bought
them
for
working
out
at
the
gym
and
so
far
they
have
been
great
the
fit
is
perfect
and
they
never
fall
out
the
sound
isn't
extravagant,
but
good
enough
to
get
me
through
my
workout
without
being
bothered
by
all
the
noise
around
me
they
paired
pretty
easily
and
stay
paired
the
case
is
great
for
storage
and
charging
and
they
charge
fairly
quickly
the
battery
life
is
great
as
can
go
whole
week
without
having
to
recharge
the
case
my
life
revolves
around
music
as
listen
to
music
nearly
every
second
everyday
first
off,
this
product
is
$0,
so
you
can't
expect
to
have
the
quality
such
as
some
kind
of
$0
bose
headphones
am
always
hesitant
to
purchase
brands
that
don't
have
much
information
on,
however,
took
chance
and
it
was
worth
it
the
sound
quality
was
crisp
and
was
quite
pleased
with
the
amount
of
bass
that
this
earbud
had
as
for
the
ear
tips,
they
fit
pretty
snug
on
myself
as
there
are
plenty
of
options
that
come
along
with
them
the
size
of
the
portable
charger
was
reasonably
small
enough
for
me
to
be
satisfied
with,
although
also
own
airpods
and
loved
the
size,
but
they
had
to
consider
battery
size
the
earbuds
last
quite
while,
i've
used
'em
for
about
hours
and
minutes,
but
probably
could
last
longer
what
love
most
about
the
charging
case
is
that
it
can
also
charge
your
phone
overall,
this
earbud
is
worth
it,
the
earbuds
went
past
my
expectations
as
wasn't
expecting
much
can
hear
absolutely
nothing
besides
whisper
have
an
iphone
with
the
volume
fully
up
and
it
almost
no
noise
coming
from
them
had
them
resend
me
new
one
the
same
day
and
guest
what
still,
didn't
work
if
turn
my
volume
down
notches
from
the
max
volume
it
completely
silent
understandably
annoyed
with
this
defective
product**update
0/0/0
the
company
was
super
attentive
to
the
fact
had
not
the
best
experience
when
first
&
replacement
ordered
after
leaving
my
review
moved
on
to
look
for
another
product
to
my
surprise
the
company
contacted
me
and
gave
me
full
nohassle
refund
although,
since
they
value
their
customers
being
happy
they
issued
me
yet
another
headset
and
must
say
this
was
the
experience
hoped
for
in
the
beginning
thank
you
so
much
to
the
sellers
customer
service
team
am
happy
with
the
headphones
no
they
don
have
bass
really
but
hey
it
great
price
for
product
that
seems
to
work
fine
for
me
for
all
know
it
can
be
the
same
product
but
it
finally
working
on
my
phone,
‍♀
‍♀
thanks
so
much
bag
to
keep
them
in
check
charging
case
to
rest
them
in
checkcharge
cord
check
multiple
ear
cushion
sizes
checkthere
are
sooooo
many
pluses
they
have
year
warranty
and
are
waterproof
too
i've
had
them
for
weeks
and
have
no
issuesi
"thought"
had
an
issue
but
that
was
my
problem
didn't
read
the
directions
and
would
touch
the
right
one
to
adjust
it
if
you
do
that
it
pauses
your
stream
this
feature
rocks
can
do
this
super
quick
when
someone
talks
to
me
rather
than
get
my
phone
unlocked
wow
hands
down,
this
product
surprised
the
hell
out
of
me
had
the
bose
sport
ear
buds
that
accidentally
forgot
had
on
before
jumping
into
the
pool
and
ruining
them
so
decided
to
go
the
cheaper
route
and
read
the
positive
reviews
on
it
and
wanted
to
see
it
for
myself,
damn
that's
all
need
to
say
the
sound
quality
is
amazing,
once
you
find
the
right
ear
inserts
to
close
any
gaps
in
the
ears,
the
comfort
is
beyond
expected,
the
dependability
and
ease
of
it
staying
in
your
ears
without
fear
of
it
coming
out,
unbelievable,
great
battery
life
is
ridiculous
amazing,
pairing
is
automatic
and
the
charging
case
is
perfect
for
any
occasion
this
is
my
first
pair
of
wireless
earbuds
&
have
to
say
really
like
them
they
are
very
comfortable
the
fit
is
snug
and
they
stayed
in
place
without
fear
of
them
falling
out
they
came
with
multiple
sizes
in
the
ear
pieces
which
is
great
because
you
are
bound
to
have
an
earpiece
that
fits
you
the
sound
quality
is
great
talked
on
the
phone
for
over
an
hour,
walked
all
over
my
house
&
outdoors
without
skip
in
the
conversation
the
only
issue
have
is
that
the
directions
weren
easy
to
follow
too
many
steps,
repetitive
at
times,
felt
like
the
translation
over
to
english
may
have
been
the
culprit
easy
fix
though
over
all
very
happy
with
this
product
and
would
definitely
recommend
this
product
to
friends
&
family
had
been
struggling
between
purchasing
the
apple
pods
to
be
able
to
listen
to
music
and
talk
on
my
iphone
however
was
struggling
with
justify
the
cost
$0
for
pair
of
headphones
that
would
only
work
with
an
apple
product,
just
did
not
sit
well
with
me
anyway,
was
in
desperate
need
of
wireless
headphones
so
did
search
and
these
popped
up
liked
the
appearance
of
the
headphones
and
the
price
caught
my
attention
began
reading
all
of
the
reviews
and
decided
to
give
them
chance
i've
only
had
them
for
days,
but
am
soooooo
pleased
definitely
worth
the
money
great
product
comfortable,
great
quality,
clean
sheek
look,
and
easy
to
use
definitely
recommend
this
product
will
update
my
review
if
that
changes
in
the
next
few
weeks
but
so
far
so
good
update:
these
earbuds
have
lasted
me
less
than
year
ve
taken
really
good
care
of
them
but
the
max
volume
all
of
sudden
was
0%
lower
than
it
was
initially
it
unfortunate
that
have
to
now
buy
new
set
from
different
companyinitial
review:
the
battery
life
is
incredible
i've
had
it
for
about
month
and
use
the
earpods
for
an
average
of
about
hours
day
this
being
said,
have
only
had
to
recharge
the
case
once
they
have
great
noise
cancellation
and
good
sound
quality
for
the
price
paid,
wow
did
not
expect
this
device
to
work
the
way
intended
to
use
it
it
lasts
the
minimal
hours
it
reaches
all
the
way
across
the
warehouse
work
at,
and
the
sound
quality
is
amazing
especially
when
listening
to
asmr
:,
great
product
for
the
price/value
ratiothe
only
con:
wish
the
earpieces
were
tinybit
smaller
to
fit
thru
my
ear
perfectly
now
they
do
not
fall
out
or
anything
they
are
securely
in,
but
can
feel
the
pop
in
my
area
like
when
you
have
unsecured
lid
on
coffee
cup,
but
not
annoying
enough
for
less
than
stars
overall
great
earpiece
me
encantaron

único
detalle
aclarar,
que
cuando
voy

hay
muchos

el

entrecorta

supongo
que

update
replacement
earbuds
were
quickly
sent
to
me
work
0%
as
advertised
would
happily
recommend
to
anyone
who
asks
about
themoriginal:
only
one
ear
bud
works
troubleshooting
led
to
nothing
will
update
if
it
ever
gets
resolved
these
have
been
wonderful
and
they
sound
great
did
have
problem,
thought,
with
the
right
earpiece
connecting
to
the
left
and
hence,
no
sound
after
watching
several
videos
and
reading
several
reviews
and
few
comments,
was
ready
to
try
and
get
replacement
pair
but
did
little
more
investigation
with
my
sound
controls
on
my
phone
and
discovered
that
the
right
device
was
packed
with
earwax
yuck
my
bad
cleaned
'em
up
and
now
they
work
great
again
the
only
con
have
is
that
am
reluctant
to
wear
them
while
outside
jogging
for
fear
of
one
device
falling
out
of
my
ear
but
that's
just
me
update:
the
left
headphone
just
went
out
yesterday
no
explanation
have
no
idea
what
the
cause
was
so
sad
really
liked
thesepros:
size
have
small
ears
so
most
ear
buds
either
hurt
or
fall
out
of
my
ears
these
are
great
size
they
don't
hurt
and
stay
put
the
sound
is
great
the
battery
life
is
fantasticcons:
my
phone
pairs
to
the
headphones
even
while
in
the
case
and
can't
get
it
to
disconnect
unless
tell
my
phone
to
forget
the
device
super
annoying
maybe
there's
way
to
turn
them
off
and
missed
it
also
wish
the
headphones
would
stay
connected
at
greater
distance
from
my
phone
but
that's
not
huge
problem
for
me
just
would
make
them
better
so,
bought
these
in
april
of
it's
now
october
0th,
the
charging
base
has
stopped
charging
the
ear
buds
which
makes
them
useless
don't
know
if
there
is
some
sort
of
warranty
have
used
the
ear
buds
four
nights
week
for
an
hour
or
two
really
liked
them
and
the
whole
device
is
too
light
to
use
as
boat
anchor
don't
buy
great
quality
sound,
no
problems
with
hearing
people
or
people
hearing
me
on
call,
easy
to
connect,
easy
functionalities,
and
battery
life
is
pretty
good
and
it's
pretty
nice
to
be
able
to
charge
my
phone
on
the
charging
dock
thing
when
i'm
out
and
about
they
are
little
bigger
than
expected,
but
doesn't
seem
to
be
problem
also,
if
you're
wondering,
they
really
are
waterproofmy
son
wore
them
in
the
shower
these
are
horrible
do
not
buy
especially
for
children
had
mine
for
only
few
weeks
only
used
couple
times
took
forever
to
charge,
then
they
would
read
fully
charged
and
battery
would
die
in
around
an
hour,
then
while
in
use
for
about
half
hour
got
burned
on
inside
of
my
ear,
it
just
got
very
hot
very
fast
luckily
was
able
to
take
out
fast
but
if
it
was
child
it
could
have
been
way
worse
would
not
recommend
these
at
all
only
getting
star
cause
you
can't
leave
it
at
zero
bought
these
mainly
for
the
gym
and
have
to
say
that
i'm
not
impressed
they
are
fine
for
use
around
the
house
but
went
for
run
and
had
my
ipod
in
my
pocket
and
the
music
kept
cutting
out
every
second
so
held
my
ipod
around
my
waist
and
there
was
no
change
had
to
hold
it
near
my
head
to
get
fairly
continuous
music
but
it
still
cut
out
intermittently
maybe
got
lemon
but
wouldn't
recommend
these
unless
you
are
watching
youtube
at
homeupdate:
so
the
customer
service
is
very
attentive
they
contacted
me
after
my
review,
offered
to
refund
my
purchase
and
send
me
new
pair
to
try
agreed
and
gave
the
second
pair
shot
went
for
another
run
and
there
was
no
change
during
the
run
switched
my
ipod
from
my
right
side
to
my
left
side
this
made
noticeable
difference
but
the
must
still
cut
in
and
out
they
work
best
when
your
device
has
clear
shot
at
the
left
earbud
and
if
you
keep
your
head
straight
anytime
turned
my
head
or
looked
up,
the
music
cut
out
again,
still
wouldn't
use
them
for
working
out
this
product
is
amazing
for
going
to
the
gym
the
bluetooth
headphones
stay
in
your
ear
which
is
incredibly
surprising,
and
never
fell
out
don't
feel
weary
with
the
cost,
it's
definitely
worth
it
when
first
tried
it
out,
was
concerned
because
it
didn't
feel
comfortable
but
realized
that
there
were
other
ear
pieces
to
try
on
mine
was
medium
would
totally
give
it
more
stars
if
could
this
is
my
0th
time
wearing
it,
each
day
around
0/0
hours
the
sound
quality
is
great,
can
hear
the
music
i'm
playing
clearly
and
loudly
the
design
is
better
than
other
ear
buds
seen
on
amazon
because
it
actually
is
for
human
ears
and
not
some
weird
alien
with
tubes
as
ears
if
you
put
these
on
correctly,
you
can
shake
your
head
as
hard
as
you
can
and
they
won't
come
off
also
because
of
how
they
fit,
they
cancel
out
noises
nicely
we
have
several
earbuds
in
the
family
and
these
are
by
far
the
easiest
to
pair
with
device
that
we
have
sound
quality
is
good
as
is,
but
the
product
includes
several
sizes
of
attachments
to
adjust
the
size
of
the
earbuds
to
create
better
seal
around
the
ear
and
optimize
the
sound
with
few
micro
adjustments,
you
will
notice
difference
have
not
used
these
around
water
yet,
so
cannot
comment
on
the
waterproof
aspect
it
will
be
summer
before
will
know
for
sure,
but
in
the
meantime
really
enjoying
using
these
they
look
sleek
also
picture
included
really
enjoyed
using
these
headphones
the
past
day
and
half
can
say
that
am
very
happy
with
my
purchase
the
sound
quality
is
amazing
and
compares
to
some
of
the
top
notch
wireless
earbuds
on
the
market
today
with
or
without
my
dolby
atmos
on,
also
really
enjoy
that
the
bud
themselves
are
durable,
and
the
waterproofing
works
i've
used
them
in
the
shower
but
not
for
too
long
also
the
bud
are
touch
sensitive
on
the
logo
which
makes
pausing
music
or
skipping
to
the
next
track
so
simple
and
easy
the
charge
life
on
these
things
are
amazing
i've
used
them
for
about
or
hours
straight
and
haven't
even
got
the
battery
low
warning
the
charge
box
is
also
very
durable
and
keeps
great
charge
while
also
charging
the
buds
within
an
hour
didn't
really
have
chance
to
use
the
power
bank;
but
made
sure
that
it
worked
properly
it
also
comes
with
small
bag
to
keep
your
charge
box
in
overall
give
0/0
only
because
the
right
bud
had
problems
staying
on
the
charger
connectors,
but
it
only
took
light
poke
to
reconnect
so
in
my
opinion
it's
great
product
and
perfect
alternative
to
expensive,
over
priced
wireless
ear
buds
**update**
when
wrote
my
initial
review,
was
beyond
amazon's
requirements
to
qualify
for
refund
it
left
me
very
disappointed
due
to
the
fact
had
only
had
my
earbuds
short
while
when
they
stopped
working
correctly
since
that
time,
the
manufacturers
took
it
upon
themselves
to
contact
me
with
the
intent
to
replace
my
earbuds
at
no
cost,
as
well
as
refund
my
purchase
this
was
something
they
didn't
have
to
do
but
they
did
also,
the
replacement
headphones
are
working
well
so
fari'm
very
impressed
with
any
organization
that
will
go
out
of
their
way
to
provide
their
customers
with
the
best
possible
experience
still
only
gave
four
stars
only
because
of
the
issues
found
with
the
previous
earbuds
however,
i'd
like
to
give
an
overwhelming
stars
for
the
amazing
customer
service
provided
to
me
thank
youi
don't
normally
leave
reviews
for
products
ordered
these
earbuds
the
beginning
of
the
year
so
could
use
them
while
working
out
after
doing
some
research,
decided
to
go
with
the
pasanomi
earbuds
because
of
the
reviews
as
well
as
the
value
the
design
is
great
and
the
earbuds
fit
comfortably
in
the
ear
that
being
said,
they
were
great
for
the
time
they
worked
i've
only
had
them
for
two
months
and
connectivity
now
continues
to
be
an
issue
as
sound
cuts
in
and
out
additionally,
one
earbud
will
work
while
the
other
cuts
out
all
togetheri've
done
all
the
troubleshooting
and
they
still
don't
work
proper
very
frustrating
as
i'm
unable
to
return
i've
had
these
earbuds
for
month
wear
one
at
time
while
i'm
at
work
but
the
case
latch
is
loose
and
the
bluetooth
keeps
saying,
"second
device
connected,
disconnected,
connected,
disconnected",
over
and
over
again
this
is
because
the
case
loosens
enough
for
it
to
connect
to
my
phone
even
though
it's
still
in
the
case
this
happens
about
times
every
minutes
it's
very
annoying
but
seem
to
have
solved
the
problem
with
tape
around
the
case
and
piece
of
paper
inside
to
keep
the
earbuds
firmly
in
place
so
they
won't
turn
on
it's
very
irritating
to
have
that
interruption
constantly
throughout
the
day
for
the
price
paid
on
these
shouldn't
need
tape
and
peice
of
paper
to
make
them
function
properly
all
other
aspects
of
this
bluetooth
like
the
battery
life
is
amazing
and
the
sound
quality
is
great
i've
had
these
for
little
while
at
first
was
super
unhappy
with
the
battery
life
but
realized
that
should
have
read
the
description
better
because
it
does
state
the
battery
life
duration
would
have
looked
for
better
options
i've
also
had
issues
with
them
staying
in
my
ears
regardless
of
which
size
use
but
have
this
problem
with
all
ear
buds
so
maybe
have
weird
ears
my
main
gripe
is
where
the
pause
function
is
because
every
time
slightly
touch
the
ear
bud
it
pauses
my
music
really
blown
away
by
this
product
and
how
it
is
still
holding
up
it
has
some
connection
problems
from
time
to
time
they
do
tend
to
collect
lot
of
earwax
to
the
point
it
tends
to
get
gross
from
time
to
time
the
charge
of
the
pack
itself
holds
for
good
amount
of
time
very
compact
as
well
honestly
want
another
pair
for
back
up
soon
the
product
is
pretty
epic
in
my
option
first
of
all
its
small,
compact,
and
its
black
it
doesn't
stand
out
when
wearing
it
like
those
airpodsmotion
sensor
for
the
finger
to
control
the
music,
phone
call,
or
volume
what's
cool
about
this
is
that
each
earpiece
had
mic
meaning
could
wear
one,
my
friend
could
wear
one,
and
we
both
can
talk
to
the
same
person,
from
certain
distance
apart
the
design
of
the
earpiece
as
it
is
made
to
stay
in
when
in
constant
motion
like
me
doing
parkour
but
the
downside
is
that
the
cheek
muscles
can
push
against
it,
potentially
force
it
out;
mostly
includes
smilingit's
waterproof
and
that
meant
can
take
shower
with
it
on,
go
running
in
the
rain,
or
go
swimming
in
my
friend's
backyard
pool
advice
to
not
take
shower
with
them
on
and
sleeping
with
them
on
it
would
increase
the
chance
of
an
ear
infection
or
possibly
hearing
loss
if
the
volume
is
to
the
max
loved
these
when
first
got
them
about
months
in,
lost
some
sound
in
the
left
earbud
now
months
in,
lost
sound
in
both
have
tried
unpairing
and
redoing
and
still
won't
work
for
what
paid
guess
their
ok
but
wish
they
lasted
longer
will
say,
used
everyday
for
about
hours
and
got
some
use
out
of
them
now
will
get
different
brand
won't
even
bother
contacting
the
company
after
what
others
have
gone
through
i'm
sure
it's
the
norm
for
these
these
are
hands
down
the
best
earbuds
own
battery
life
is
phenomenal
hours
straight
music
play
no
problem
case
last
week
without
charging
sound
is
crystal
clear
,not
noise
canceling,
but
you
can
forget
they
are
in
they
are
so
comfortable
the
only
con
is
the
case
is
hard
to
open
always
use
some
steelstick
epoxy
to
make
lip
to
make
it
easier
to
open
design
lip
to
open
easier
have
been
searching
for
affordable
wireless
earbuds
that
are
not
only
easy
to
use
but
have
long
battery
life
these
wireless
earbuds
are
exactly
what
needed
and
wanted
the
case
is
small
and
compact
can
easily
carry
it
in
my
purse
or
just
in
my
hand
the
only
recommendation
have
with
the
case
is
to
have
place
to
store
the
usb
cord
since
the
case
is
so
small,
you
are
forced
to
store
the
cord
elsewhere
was
able
to
easily
connect
the
bluetooth
and
the
earbuds
are
comfortable
in
your
ears
have
small
ears
and
am
always
looking
for
earbuds
that
are
comfortable
or
are
customizable
in
size/fit
was
surprised
by
how
comfortable
they
were,
but
also
how
well
they
stayed
put
the
battery
life
is
perfect,
especially
since
use
the
earbuds
for
work,
gym,
and
just
hanging
out
we
wanted
wireless
earphones
to
use
at
the
gym
and
they
showed
up
on
our
search
we
bought
of
them
and
they
do
their
job
well
earphones
do
not
fall
off,
even
while
running
one
of
our
box
broke
where
it
was
not
charging
the
left
side
earphone
we
worked
with
the
seller
to
get
replacement
and
they
sent
us
one
immediately
very
good
customer
service
bought
these
to
listen
to
my
music
they
came
in
an
awesome
package
and
was
able
to
listen
to
my
music
as
soon
as
opened
them
up
like
the
case
it
is
securely
keeps
the
buds
in
as
well
as
easy
to
charge
super
easy
to
operate
with
my
iphone
the
sound
clarity
is
amazing
better
than
expectedthe
fit
of
the
ear
buds
has
taken
me
little
time
to
get
used
too
and
if
wear
them
for
few
hours,
my
ears
don
hurt,
but
do
notice
the
weight
of
the
bud
not
terrible
thing,
but
it
is
why
didn
give
stars
at
first,
wrote
great
review
these
were
working
perfectly
was
amazed
but
$0
earbuds
do
not
last
for
long
weeks
later:the
connectivity
is
terrible
every
seconds
have
to
take
out
the
earbud,
put
it
back
in
the
case,
and
put
it
in
again
even
then,
it
takes
forever
to
reconnect
both
earbuds
are
named
the
same
thing
x0
so
don't
know
what
to
connect
to
finally,
as
was
watching
video,
the
audio
cut
out
completely
do
not
buy
these
earbuds
they
work
for
weeks
and
then
break
down
am
now
returning
the
earbuds
and
am
planning
on
buying
different
pair
from
another
company
these
are
worth
the
buy
if
you
don
care
about
brand
names
the
quality
is
really
good
they
are
noise
canceling
and
the
bass
is
goodthese
stay
in
my
ear
when
working
out
haven
had
any
trouble
with
them
slipping
out
yetpairing
them
to
my
phone
was
super
easy
after
the
initial
pair
they
auto
pair
right
after
you
take
them
out
the
charging
pod
and
put
them
into
your
earyou
can
tap
the
outside
of
the
bud
to
pause
or
play
on
either
left
or
right
sidenot
sure
about
the
battery
life
as
ve
been
using
these
for
about
week
now
and
haven
had
to
charge
them
yet
will
follow
up
in
couple
months
about
battery
lifethe
charging
case
is
little
bulky
but
it
not
too
bad
it
will
stick
out
if
you
try
to
keep
it
in
your
pocketoverall,
highly
recommend
if
wear
the
right
hat,
can
use
these
at
work
even
though
the
boss
says
zero
tolerance,
know
about
him
taking
the
new
girl
who
cleans
at
night
on
secret
warehouse
tours
like
she
needs
tour
twice
week
she's
been
working
here
for
over
month
already
and
she
doesn't
even
clean
in
the
warehouse
real
subtle
dale
that
being
said
these
suck
they
constantly
take
over
my
blue
tooth
you
can't
turn
them
off
and
they
hate
working
alone
for
the
price
of
these,
am
impressed
it
was
simple
to
pair
and
connect
them
to
my
phone
and
the
sound
quality
was
better
than
expected
these
come
in
nice
charging
case,
can
only
hope
the
lid
lasts
through
long
term
use
do
not
know
how
long
full
charge
will
last,
as
have
only
used
them
for
few
minutes
each
time
tried
them
in
different
areas
indoors,
outdoors
recommend
these
for
anyone
looking
for
wireless
earbuds
but
don
want
to
pay
high
price
am
frequently
active
in
my
daily
life,
whether
it
be
walking
around
or
going
to
the
gym
needed
set
of
bluetooth
earbuds
that
accommodated
this
lifestyle
since
have
broken
five
or
so
"dongles"
that
are
dollars
apiece
from
apple
was
incredibly
close
to
buying
apple
airpods,
but
am
glad
didn't
and
saved
the
extra
dollars
these
earbuds
perform
the
job
very
well
this
is
what
noticed
after
wearing
them
consistently
every
day
for
week
and
halfthey

high

bluetooth
earbud
read
so
many
good
reviews
on
this
product
and
had
high
hopes
in
the
end
wasn't
satisfied
because:0
the
sound
quality
is
horrible
not
sure
if

defective
earbuds0
the
earbuds
do
not
connect
to
my
phone
once
take
them
out
of
the
case
have
to
repeatedly
unpair
the
earbuds
and
pair
again
or
else
it
won't
connect
at
all
once
the
earbuds
say
"pairing"
and
have
turned
off
my
bluetooth
to
see
if
it
will
connect
after
turn
it
back
on
and
it
does
not
very
dissatisfied0
the
earbuds
randomly
start
lagging
on
my
music
after
moving
my
phone
from
my
chest
to
my
waistthe
only
good
thing
about
this
is
the
case
charger
haven't
had
to
charge
it
once
since
received
it
and
it's
still
at
full
battery,
but
it's
not
worth
the
hassle
because
of
the
above
issues
not
worth
bucks
these
headphones
were
pretty
good
for
about
three
months
not
the
most
comfortable
but
the
sound
quality
is
pretty
good
and
they
never
fell
out
of
my
earshowever,
after
about
months
of
rare/intermittent
use,
the
headphones
stopped
pairing;
music
would
only
play
out
of
one
earbud,
and
the
only
way
could
find
to
pair
them
again
was
to
plug
them
into
an
outletthen,
after
about
months
of
intermittent
use,
the
right
earbud
suddenly
started
putting
out
only
quiet/tinny
soundtldr;
decent
earbuds
for
few
months
but
stopped
properly
working
fairly
quickly
would
not
recommend
like
that
these
earphones
are
portable
which
you
can
fit
into
ur
pocket
lasts
long
for
about
mayb
hrs
if
only
use
one
earbud
at
time
whenever
have
already
connected
it
to
ur
phone
and
just
put
it
back
into
case
to
charge,
then
use
it
again
it
will
automatically
reconnect
to
ur
phone
like
it
for
being
on
the
go,
portable,
and
being
at
good
price
for
all
of
it
featureshope
this
helps
also,
gave
it
as
gift
to
my
dad,
he
was
the
one
who
mentioned
these
points
as
well
:
these
worked
for
me
for
few
months
and
liked
them,
but
out
of
nowhere
one
of
them
stopped
working
its
so
quiet
can
just
barely
hear
anything
coming
out
of
it,
while
the
other
works
normally
i've
tried
the
resync
and
i've
tried
resetting
the
bluetooth,
tried
on
multiple
devices,
and
no
dice
my
review
would
have
been
but
they're
unusable
now
these
are
good
headphones
for
the
price
gave
stars
because
there
isn't
'quick
charge'
option
will
drain
phone
battery
quickly
when
plugged
into
that
as
charger
liked
that
the
case
has
magnetic
piece
to
keep
the
earbuds
in
place
for
charging
as
far
as
sound
quality,
it
is
definitely
good
for
the
price,
but
not
in
the
same
category
as
bose
or
even
jaybird
the
anatomy
of
my
ear
is
unique,
and
usually
cannot
wear
headphones
without
the
part
that
hugs
the
ear
however,
have
not
had
one
issue
with
these
falling
out
it
was
so
nice
not
to
have
to
stop
during
my
workout
to
adjust
the
earpiece
the
controls
were
also
easy
to
get
used
to
double
tap
to
skip
track,
etc
noticed
difference
in
sound
quality
when
streaming
music
as
opposed
to
having
it
on
my
phone
other
than
that,
would
recommend
these
bought
these
headphones
months
ago
and
after
two
months
of
constant
use,
can
honestly
say
this
was
great
purchase
pros:0
these
do
great
job
of
cancelling
surrounding
noise0
in
my
opinion,
the
quality
of
sound
is
fantastic
for
the
price
point0
ve
run
races
and
done
various
types
of
work
outs
and
they
remain
in
place0
the
battery
lasts
forever
think
charge
them
once
every
week
or
two
and
use
them
every
day
at
work0
love
the
magnetic
case
it
comes
with
easy
to
throw
into
gym
bag
or
purse
and
it
charges
the
ear
buds0
easily
pairs
with
my
phone
and
doesn
randomly
disconnectcons:0
for
me,
it
pain
to
change
songs/pause/increase
volume
find
have
to
hit
the
ear
buds
the
right
way
for
it
to
work
and
think
it
could
be
more
user
friendly
just
got
these
and
so
far,
exactly
what
expected
they
paired
with
my
phone
instantly,
the
sound
quality
is
actually
better
than
thought
it
would
be
however,
the
bass
is
truly
lacking
but
the
mid's
and
high's
are
nice
and
crisp
took
phone
call
so
far
and
was
told
that
the
sound
was
great
on
the
other
side
i'm
glad
because
these
are
much
more
comfortable
than
over
the
ear
headphones
that
push
my
ears
into
my
glasses
which
after
while
really
hurtsso,
only
the
first
day
guess
we'll
see
how
they
hold
up
and
how
long
they
work
but,
for
the
price
paid,
couldn't
be
happier
love
the
sound
of
the
apple
airpods,
but
they
fall
right
out
of
my
ears
so
really
had
to
find
something
else
these
earbuds
have
the
best
sound
quality
from
other
earbuds
ve
had
and
the
noise
cancellation
is
great
too
can
barely
hear
someone
talk
when
have
these
ini
also
love
how
easy
it
is
to
connect
and
disconnect
the
earbuds
from
your
phone
with
these
earbuds
you
never
have
to
worry
about
it
battery
life
when
you
want
to
turn
it
off
because
it
automatically
disconnects
when
it
put
in
it
charging
casealso
speaking
of
the
charging
case
it
has
an
outlet
for
you
to
charge
your
phone,
and
the
lights
in
the
case
is
great
help
to
show
how
much
battery
the
case
itself
hasone
suggestion
do
have
for
the
product
is
for
the
charging
case
to
have
more
mah
power,
to
charge
my
phone
faster
but
also
the
company's
response
to
me
reaching
out
to
them
but
let's
tarantino
thisi
used
these
headphones
for
about
two
weeks
before
making
my
opinion
on
them
was
initially
extremely
impressed
by
the
look
of
these
headphones
the
box
looked
professional,
clean
the
headphones
looked
the
same
the
case
was
great
size,
not
too
big,
not
too
small
they
didn't
fit
perfectly,
but
we
all
have
different
sized
ears
once
put
one
of
the
many
replacement
ear
tips
in,
they
fit
great
however,
there
was
one
huge
thing
that
turned
me
off
about
them:they
sounded
horrible
according
to
their
amazon
page
these
earbuds
offer
"crystal
clarity
and
deep,
resonant
bass
with
delicately
tuned
sound
signature
deliver
immersive
sound
and
put
you
on
the
stage
center"
on
the
contrary,
found
that
the
earbuds
offered
no
base
at
all
none
in
fact,
there
was
so
little
bass
that
the
treble
gave
sickening
feeling,
piercing
feeling
that
gave
you
nothing
but
discomforti
emailed
the
company
and
mentioned
this,
wondering
to
them
if
maybe
the
headphones
were
faulty
because
there
is
no
way
they
could
be
designed
this
way
and
they
thought
it
was
good
idea
to
describe
the
bass
in
this
manner
and
this
is
when
started
noticing
some
issues
with
their
service:
they
told
me
to
change
the
ear
tipsi'm
sorry,
what
the
ear
buds
fitting
better
in
my
ear
are
not
going
to
miraculously
fix
distinct
lack
of
the
lower
end
of
the
audio
spectrum
however,
was
patient
and
tried
it
lo
and
behold,
it
did
nothing
they
then
told
me
to
download
some
app
or
another
told
them
that,
no
offense
meant,
but
did
not
want
to
have
to
litter
my
phone
with
apps
that
don't
want
in
order
to
make
their
headphones
work
the
way
they're
supposed
to
work
this
is
when
they
completely
lost
me
as
customer:
they
offered
to
give
me
$0
refund
now,
until
this
point
was
completely
fine
with
returning
the
headphones
and
trying
out
another
pair
just
in
case
it
was
manufacturing
issue
but
this
almost
seemed
like
slap
in
the
face
$0
back
is,
once
again,
not
going
to
fix
the
issueall
in
all,
the
only
reason
this
even
got
star
review
is
because
the
case
worked
like
it
was
supposed
to
and
the
ear
buds
fit
decently
other
than
that,
the
sound
quality
is
horrendous
and
customer
service
is
clearly
lacking
in
common
courtesy
got
these
headphones
as
wanted
something
wireless
and
more
portable
than
the
over
ear
headphones
use
at
home
they
fit
well
in
the
ear,
they
sound
good
and
they
pair
easily
with
my
devices
would
really
like
to
like
them
the
problem
is
that
the
sound
in
the
right
ear
keeps
cutting
out
if
understand
correctly,
the
right
ear
piece
pairs
with
the
left,
and
the
left
pairs
with
the
device
the
sound
in
the
left
ear
is
fine,
but
the
signal
between
the
left
and
right
does
not
seem
good
do
like
them,
but
it
is
annoying
when
the
sound
cuts
out
every
minute
or
two
haven't
pursued
any
customer
service
options
this
far,
but
my
first
impression
is
not
as
good
as
would
have
hoped

you

for

price
thoroughly
recommend
the
pasonomi
x0
earbuds
as
an
owner
of
apple
airpods
was
bit
skeptical
but
was
very
impressed,
they
fit
in
my
ears
better
because
of
the
soft
ear
tip
pieces,
also
was
able
to
put
different
tip
on
my
left
ear
which
seems
to
have
slightly
larger
opening,
so
they
fit
perfectly
and
stay
in
well,
even
while
walking
around
like
that
they
also
don
stop
if
one
does
fall
out,
like
my
airpods
do
really
glad
to
have
found
these
earbudsi
think
might
have
to
buy
my
teenage
daughter
pair
they
also
come
not
only
with
the
charging
case
but
small
drawstring
leatherish
bag
that
will
make
them
harder
to
misplace
got
these
for
my
husband
and
he
loves
them
they
were
packaged
very
nicely
and
the
rechargable
case
is
very
solid
and
nice
looking
the
buds
themselves
are
very
solid
as
well
and
there
were
many
sizes
of
adapters
to
fit
any
size
ears
the
sound
is
great
and
they
re
very
easy
to
pair
they
can
be
tricky
to
not
hit
the
button
when
your
inserting
them
but
it
just
takes
some
getting
used
to
definitely
great
purchase
and
would
highly
recommend
just
like
anything
else,
was
super
skeptical,
however
since
the
manufacture
offered
year
warranty,
assumed
they
would
be
decenti
was
blown
away
do
about
minutes
of
cardio
and
minutes
of
weight
training
days
week
out
of
the
package,
have
not
had
to
charge
them
yet
the
holding
case
is

alone
charging
device,
so
every
time
you
finish
working
out
and
put
the
buds
away,
they
start
to
charge
againit
comes
with
multiple
sizes
s/m/l
and,
think
at
east
of
each
my
last
set
of
headphones,
my
trophies
tore
apart
the
buds,
so
had
to
use
the
incorrect
size

these
are
awesome
headphones
have
zero
complaints
can
wear
then
for
about
hrs
before
have
to
charge
them
and
the
have
to
stick
them
in
it
takes
about
minutes
to
charge
the
buds
back
up
my
only
complaint
is
that
someone
stole
them
at
work
so
dont
have
them
anymore
the
first
month
was
the
only
month
when
this
product
performed

then
started
to
see
the
following

would
recommend
spending
more
money
on

not
very
happy

again,

one
day
the

just
suddenly
dropped
significantly
lower
than
the
left
and
just
never
went
back
to

later
emailed
the
company
requesting
to
renew
the

policy
that
came
with
the
headphones
they
instead
sent
me
instructions
on
how
to
reset
the
headphones,
which
resulted
in
the
left
earbud
now
longer
connecting
at
all,
and
the
right
still
connecting,
but
with
the

lower

only
grabbed

of
dollars
on
the
apple
or
samsung
alternatives
was
between
the
samsung
galaxy
buds
and
these
for
my
father's
birthday
he
works
lot
and
has
been
looking
for
wireless
earbuds
to
use
when
outdoors
the
quality
of
these
buds
and
their
ease
in
syncing
with
galaxy
s0
was
incredible
just
take
them
out
of
the
charging
case
and
perform
onetime
sync
with
your
phone
and
that's
it
when
you
take
one
out,
it
pauses
your
music
temporarily
but
lets
you
resume
so
you
can
work
with
only
one
in
built
in
touch
controls
are
great
for
skip/rewind
and
volume
control
the
case
doubling
as
power
bank
is
nice
to
have
feature
when
on
the
go
even
when
sweaty
and
moving
about,
they
grip
in
the
ear
without
any
pressure
and
block
out
ambient
noise
very
well
overall,
would
buy
again
absolutely
love
these
earbuds
love
the
way
they
fit
the
bass
is
stellar
the
sound
is
clear
and
crisp
am
so
surprised
honestly
expected
way
worse
the
only
reason
am
giving
stars
is
because
of
the
flashing
blue
light
while
it
connected
in
the
dark
look
like
robot
or
alien
space
explorer
covered
it
with
micro
piece
of
electric
tape
to
stop
the
flashing
otherwise
amazing
was
very
impressed
with
these
earbuds
was
slightly
skeptical
with
the
price
point
to
begin
with
they
came
in
quickly
the
price
was
more
than
fair
the
case
and
earbuds
themselves
do
not
feel
cheap
at
all
they
charge
quickly
and
the
battery
life
actually
impressed
me
they
were
easy
to
sync
and
the
sound
was
pretty
good
my
only
complaint
was
that
the
bass
wasnt
that
great
but
for
the
price
and
all
of
the
other
pros
of
the
product,
will
gladly
deal
with
it
had
to
replace
the
0st
set
got
bc
earbud
stopped
charging
and
they
didn
allow
me
to
hear
my
conversations
this
0nd
set
of
earbuds
has
been
great
can
hear
all
my
conversations
and
all
my
music
fits
in
my
ears
great
and
comes
with
extra
buds
for
different
fitting
the
battery
is
decent,
it
could
be
longer,
but
it
does
have
the
charger
box
that
will
recharge
it
again
it
didn
take
to
long
just
received
these
earbuds
and
had
an
user
error
issue
in
the
beginning
reached
out
to
the
company
and
the
promptly
respond
to
assist
me
now
that
know
what
am
doing
am
very
happy
with
my
purchase
the
range
on
the
ear
buds
when
am
away
from
my
phone
is
awesome
can
leave
the
phone
on
my
desk
at
work
and
go
to
the
restroom
with
them
still
in
my
ears
was
surprised
the
music
didn
cut
out
also
wear
these
when
working
out
and
they
don
budge
from
my
ears
the
only
thing
is
would
practice
using
them
before
you
get
to
the
gym
for
me,
controlling
them
was
little
tricky
at
first
really
lime
it,
had
it
only
for
month
and
it
not
disappointed
me
so
far
,
they
starts
working
asap
take
them
out
of
the
container
and
it
connects
beautiful
cannot
tell
you
the
quality
of
sound
because
use
youtube
lot
so
the
quality
of
sound
could
be
anything
and
never
had
very
highquality
topnotch
brands
headphones
prior
to
this
but
this
one
sounds
pretty
good
and
have
no
complain
so
far
over
all
very
much
loved
them,
they
were
bit
sensitive
for
me,
my
hair
would
turn
them
off
easy
gave
them
to
my
boyfriend
who
used
them
at
work,
he
never
had
this
issue
what
actually
ended
up
being
the
biggest
thing
was
the
charge
port
from
day
one
it
was
finicky
but
we
just
dealt
with
it
just
few
days
ago,
after
only
having
it
maybe
months
wanted
to
charge
it
and
when
put
the
wire
in
the
port
retreated
into
the
base,
haven't
tried
to
get
it
out
mostly
cause
in
my
experience
it
just
makes
it
worse
my
bf
very
much
loved
these
had
good
long
life
so
he
rarely
had
to
mess
with
them
at
work,
and
sense
he
kept
them
under
those
work
muff
things
he
never
had
an
issue
with
them
turning
themselves
off
the
earbud
tip
is
like
cut
in
half
earbud
tip
for
this
reason,
it
does
not
allow
for
snug
fitthe
sound
is
too
airy
and
is
weighted
more
towards
mid
and
treble
kind
of
sounds
distant
like
listening
through
tubethe
amount
of
bass
left
you
wanting
more
this
is
slightly
due
to
not
having
snug
fitnot
fan
of
the
"congratulations
winner"
card
in
the
box
on
the
back
of
the
card
was
directions
to
email
strange
email
address
dont
know
what
happened
but
the
left
ear
peice
is
never
the
same
volume
level
as
the
right
it
wasnt
like
that
at
first
but
over
month
or
so
it
happened
ear
peice
itself
fits
nicely
in
my
ear
and
stays
where
it
should
the
response
time
from
the
moment
hit
pause
to
the
moment
it
actually
pauses
is
or
full
seconds
samething
with
song
change
battery
life
is
decent
distance
can
go
from
my
phone
while
bluetooth
is
working
is
real
nice
would
rate
these
stars
if
they
were
easier
to
clean
sadly,
the
earbuds
plug
with
earwax
until
it
is
almost
impossible
to
hear
sound
then
cleaning
them
is
difficult
and
it
seems
that
damaged
mine
attempting
to
do
soover
the
years
have
used
perhaps
dozen
different
kinds
of
earbuds
and
these
are
the
only
ones
that
ever
plugged
with
earwax
tend
to
use
as
single
ear
unit
so
can
still
hear
others
while
working
either
of
these
units
can
pair
as
single
and
play
both
channels
through
the
one
piece,
or
you
can
pair
both
together
for
full
stereo
sound
this
allows
continuous
swapping
of
unit
throughout
the
day
with
the
case
charger
sound
volume
is
not
as
high
as
some
other
units
but
so
far
functionality
is
top
units
also
maintain
contact
with
phone
up
to
0ft
away
depending
on
walls,
etc
these
headphones
do
what
was
hoping
for
when
i'm
sitting
at
my
desk
or
at
home
the
big
issue
have
is
as
soon
as
go
outside,
connectivity
becomes
crap
shoot
regularly
going
in
and
out
of
both
ears
considering
that
my
primary
use
time
is
during
commutes,
this
can
get
incredibly
frustratingbeyond
issues
with
audio
going
in
and
out
when
outside,
have
also
had
numerous
issues
getting
the
headphones
to
pair
with
my
phone
leading
me
to
have
to
factory
reset
them
on
nearly
weekly
basis
ve
been
using
these
consistently
over
the
past
year
for
about
hours
per
day
during
the
week
while
working
they
are
very
good
in
terms
of
sound
and
noise
cancellation
and
they
re
very
easy
to
connect
and
use
in
start/stop
schedule
throughout
the
day
however,
the
left
earbud
has
been
getting
more
and
more
faint,
and
is
slowing
ceasing
to
function
the
right
is
still
going
strong
but
it
is
now
almost
impossible
to
have
both
in
together
due
to
the
balance
difference
the
malfunction
is
causing
they
re
great
headphones
while
they
last,
but
would
seriously
question
the
quality
if
you
re
intending
to
use
these
multiple
hours
per
day
consistently
frankly,
not
great
certainly
not
worth
the
$0°°
price
tag
consistently
can't
decide
if
it
should
connect
to
your
paired
device
or
try
to
pair
to
new
one
have
to
constantly
put
the
buds
back
in
the
case
and
remove
them
again,
hoping
they'll
connect
this
time
and
not
randomly
go
into
pairing
mode
also
difficult
to
remove
from
the
case
your
fingers
have
no
purchase
on
the
smooth
buds
and
there's
no
lip
to
get
under
to
pull
them
out
left
bud
is
now
much
quieter
than
the
rightit
is
nice
having
case
that
can
charge
your
phone
though
because
like
them
so
much
i've
had
these
true
wireless
earbuds
for
couple
of
months
now
and
really
enjoy
them
first,
appreciate
their
battery
life,
lasting
about
hours
i'm
able
to
work
with
one
earbud
in
and
then
when
it
dies,
just
put
in
the
other
earbud
without
much
hasslefor
working
out,
wouldn't
trust
them
running
because
i'm
little
paranoid
about
them
falling
out
and
stepping
on
them,
but
for
biking
think
they're
perfect
their
noise
cancelling
isn't
great
but
that's
good
for
outside
exercise
since
you
want
to
be
able
to
hear
what's
around
youthey
come
with
large
number
of
sizes
of
tips
so
it
should
cover
wide
variety
of
ear
shapes
and
sizestheir
range
is
decent,
ranging
from
feet
or
so
to
about
if
you
want
to
walk
around
the
house
away
from
your
phoneoverall,
highly
recommend
buying
these
as
first
pair
of
true
wireless
earbuds
had
difficulty
getting
them
to
work
at
first
but,
was
able
to
figure
it
out
the
sound
was
great
and
love
that
they
are
wireless
especially
like
using
them
while
at
the
gym
they
stayed
in
my
ears
with
no
problems
and
liked
not
feeling
like
was
attached
to
my
treadmill
also
likes
using
them
while
doing
things
around
the
house
was
able
to
listen
to
my
music
while
in
the
other
room
it
was
better
than
having
to
move
my
potable
bluetooth
from
room
to
room
am
very
happy
with
this
product
and
have
no
complaints
the
only
negative
thing
have
with
them
thus
far;
really
like
the
quality
of
the
material
and
the
sound
is
crisp
there
is
only
slight
white
noise
that
is
hardly
audible
but
my
ears
are
very
sensitive
to
sound,
the
only
negative
thing
have
with
them
is
the
touch
panel
on
each
bud
is
way
too
sensitive
wish
could
turn
it
off
via
an
app
or
in
the
bluetooth
settings
on
my
phone,
my
hairbrushes
it
and
sometimes
causes
it
to
pause
do
need
haircut
though
but
overall
am
quite
satisfied
the
sound
is
good
and
they
wear
well
but
the
problem
is
they
connect
automatically,
sometimes
even
if
don't
want
them
to
i'll
be
trying
to
listen
to
music
through
bluetooth
in
my
car,
and
the
music
is
instead
playing
through
these
earbuds
no
way
to
turn
them
off
have
had
to
unpair
them
several
times
just
to
make
them
stop
connecting
like
the
sound
quality,
function,
ease
of
use,
compactness,
battery,
etc
these
are
fantastic
value
they
pair
quickly
and
easily
the
sound
is
full
and
clear
the
part
that
fits
inside
the
ear
canal
is
small
and
the
rest
does
not
protrude
but
depending
on
your
shape
of
ear,
they
may
not
be
comfortable
see
the
attached
image
if
the
leg
of
the
helix
extends
prominently
into
the
concha,
as
in
the
left,
these
and
other
buds
with
the
same
basic
design
will
likely
be
less
than
comfortable
if
not,
like
the
ear
on
the
right,
they
should
be
nice
and
comfy
for
those
in
the
right,
these
would
fit
nearly
flush
in
the
ear
and
might
even
be
ok
laying
on
them
for
those
on
the
left,
don't
even
think
about
laying
in
themso
anyway
just
like
to,recommend
people
to
buy
it
,use
it
very
good
have
very
difficult
time
finding
ear
buds
that
fit
my
ears,
and
these
fit
perfectly
from
the
second
put
them
in,
they
have
been
extremely
comfortablebest
features:
comfortable
carrying
case,
pictured
tao
the
ear
bud
to
pause
your
music
almost
noise
canceling
explanation
below
affordabilityi
mention
the
noise
canceling
because
you
see
earbuds
costing
0x
more
than
these
do
wore
them
at
school
to
test
them
out
in
the
hallways
to
see
what
could
hear
had
very
faint
noise,
but
couldn
really
make
out
any
conversationsi
would
recommend
these
if
you
were
looking
for
good
set
of
earbuds
that
won
destroy
you
wallet
really
love
that
they
truly
have
noise
cancellation,
don
hear
noises
or
talking
in
the
background
at
all,
have
to
take
out
earbud
out
just
in
case
also,
it
doesn
bother
other
people
around
me
and
the
volume
is
to
the
loudest
haven
changed
the
rubber
tips
to
fit
me
perfectly,
but
it
honestly
doesn
bother
me
and
they
don
fall
out
when
working
out
and
haven
tripped
about
sweat
probably
the
only
thing
dislike
but
honestly
don
mind
at
all,
is
that
there
limit
of
how
far
you
should
be
to
your
device,
it
ll
start
to
static
but
really
that
not
even
problem
my
final
thought
about
these
are:
0%
with
buying
for
$0
and
they
are
perfect
in
every
way
definitely
will
keep
buy
more
for
gifting
lost
the
earphones
that
came
with
my
iphone
and
these
were
great
alternative
they
were
easy
to
connect
and
sounded
great
they
feel
very
comfortable
in
your
ears
and
stay
put
had
no
issues
with
them
falling
out
at
the
gym
like
other
ear
buds,
love
that
they
are
wireless
too
they
case
chargers
them
up
so
as
long
as
the
case
is
charged
they
can
be
charged
on
the
go
buy
these
you
won't
be
disappointed
own
about
headsets
all
bluetooth
these
have
very
good
powerlife
ran
on
hour
on
and
off
not
too
bad
like
how
they
fit
into
their
compact
charger
still
trying
to
figure
out
how
long
that
charger
stays
charged
while
headsets
are
in
interesting
how
the
lady's
voice
tells
you
one
is
on
and
0nd
one
is
on
will
give
this
time
to
see
if
my
needs
are
met
in
longer
term
not
bad
for
price
not
buying
those
qtip
looking
headsets
either
never
no
complaints
other
than
slight
delay
and
some
very
brief
audio
stuttering
on
occasion
but
for
the
price
you
really
can't
beat
iti
literally
have
taken
showers
with
these
and
taken
calls
in
there
with
no
problem
other
than
the
sound
of
the
water,
hahai
recommended
these
to
everyone
was
always
skullcandy
type
of
guy
and
wanted
to
get
away
from
their
new
bluetooth
headphones
due
to
them
being
an
expensive
buy
when
found
these
figured
may
as
well
give
them
try
and
see
how
well
like
them
the
shipping
was
speedy
and
efficient,
which
was
bonus
to
the
product
now
onto
the
product
itself
at
first
was
very
skeptic
to
how
well
they
were
going
to
perform
and
if
they
were
going
to
perform
to
my
standards
and
to
say
the
least
they
actually
raised
my
standards
when
it
comes
to
wireless
headphones
they
are
comfy,
nearly
soundproof
and
best
of
all
they
are
waterproof,
so
can
listen
to
music
in
the
shower
and
when
work
out
without
worrying
about
them
getting
wet
the
case
for
the
headphones
was
also
very
nice
touch
on
the
developers
side
asthe
case
could
charge
both
the
headphones
and
my
phone
which
was
near
dying
to
near
full
charge
overall
worth
the
buy
when
received
they
already
had
full
charge
which
made
it
great
to
try
right
out
of
the
packageinstructions
for
pairing
were
very
straight
forward
had
no
issues
having
the
buds
pair
together,
but
it
did
take
few
attempts
before
my
iphone
would
pair
with
themthese
stayed
in
my
ears
very
comfortably
and
they
didn
move
throughout
my
run,
ve
had
many
earbuds
that
dont
stay
in
well
so
this
was
huge
plus
for
mein
the
first
minutes
of
use
the
right
earbud
would
cut
out
for
about
second
at
time
but
after
that
zero
issues
and
the
sound
was
greatlightweight
charging
case,
makes
it
easy
to
bring
along
in
my
bagoverall,
great
product
headphones
are
all
right
as
long
as
you
do
not
go
further
than
ft
from
where
it's
connected
or
if
you're
moving
it's
only
redeeming
quality
is
the
battery
life
on
the
headphones
and
the
case
can
be
used
as
an
external
battery
for
any
usb
honestly,
as
for
headphones
either
get
better
bluetooth
or
stick
to
wired
oneedit:
received
new
set
and
it
actually
works
better
and
doesn't
have
as
much
static
or
disconnects
if
you
go
further
than
foot
away
only
because
it
might
be
coin
flip
on
what
you
get,
wouldn't
recommend
them
but
they
aren't
bad
in
my
dedication
to
getting
out
and
doing
some
more
exercise,
decided
to
get
these
so
can
listen
to
music
while
running
or
more
honestly,
slowly
trotting
these
fit
very
well,
and
are
comfortable
in
my
ear
love
that
the
case
is
charging
case
the
sound
quality
is
very
good
considering
that
it's
bluetooth
very
similar
to
airpods
in
quality,
but
obviously
these
are
much
cheaper
strongly
recommended
refuse
to
spend
my
hard
dollars
on
just
name
tried
this
because
of
the
many
reviews
and
boy
was
it
worth
every
penny
of
mine
love
the
sleek
look
and
they
fit
perfectly
the
sound
quality
is
great
and
the
battery
life
is
up
there
mainly
use
them
for
my
jog
in
new
york
city
very
noisy
and
while
at
my
desk
at
work
love
them
love
these
headphones
they
take
some
getting
used
to
as
far
as
the
fit
and
the
battery
life
is
okay
about
hours
with
normal
use,
but
that's
where
my
complaints
stop
the
sound
quality
is
amazing
for
bluetooth
wireless
headphones,
the
durability
is
awesome
i've
dropped
them
many
times,
and
the
case
is
just
the
right
size
and
holds
its
battery
for
long
time
waited
to
write
this
review
until
month
later
to
test
if
they
would
break,
and
so
far
so
good
often
get
asked
where
bought
them
and
how
much,
and
i'm
happy
to
brag
about
my
amazing
headphones
awesome
headset
for
the
price
good
audio
quality,
good
reception
distanceunless
outside
and
downtownminneapolis
for
some
reason
each
ear
phone
can
connect
individually
to
your
phone
so,
you
can
charge
one
while
listening
through
the
otherunlike
some
brands
which
is
great
for
people
that
want
to
listen
to
something
and
also
have
an
available
ear
to
audibly
detect
what
else
is
happening
around
themconstruction,
late
night
walks
ectbattery
life
per
earpiece
is
only
about
0hrs
of
continuous
play
so,
if
you're
looking
for
headset
that
will
last
0hrs
for
both
headphones
this
isn't
your
productthe
fact
that
the
charging
case
is
also
backup
phone
charger
is
also
major
plus
had
tired
of
my
over
the
ear
headphones
and
saw
these
and
the
reviews
so
thought
would
give
them
try
as
musician
use
my
headphones
daily
and
was
pleased
with
the
quality
of
the
sound
the
set
up
for
the
earbuds
was
easy
and
pairing
with
my
iphone
and
getting
access
to
my
itunes
account
was
no
issue
once
sinked
the
earbuds
enjoyed
listening
without
having
the
bulky
old
headphones
carrying/charging
case
was
ready
to
go
when
it
arrived
battery
life
of
earbuds
as
well
as
case
was
good
earbuds
lasted
about
hours
and
have
not
needed
to
charge
the
case
yet
would
suggest
these
if
you
want
ease
of
use
for
good
price
quality
was
worth
much
more
than
the
price
guyslet
me
tell
youyou
seriously
need
to
try
these
earbuds
right
now
ordered
myself
pair
month
ago
with
the
day
shipping
the
product
arrived
in
only
one
day
which
had
me
really
excited
as
couldn't
wait
for
this
to
come
in
the
maillistening
to
music
in
these
made
me
feel
as
if
was
getting
personal
performance
by
all
of
the
worlds'
finest
musicians
whenever
would
pop
these
bad
boys
in
my
ear
wear
them
when
eat
cereal
in
the
morning
wear
them
when
want
to
tune
my
wife
out
wear
them
when
my
kids
beg
me
to
stop
by
burger
king
for
food
when
they
know
well
enough
that
we
have
food
in
the
fridge
at
home
these
earbuds
made
my
grandmother
listen
to
all
of
lil
wayne's
albums
and
now
she's
wearing
young
money
cash
money
tshirts
these
earbuds
are
horrible
they
didn
even
make
it
year
from
when
purchased
them
at
first
they
worked
great
then
they
went
down
hill
one
earbud
works
sometimes
and
it
doesn
cancel
any
noise
bought
these
based
on
the
reviews
and
was
disappointed
when
they
did
not
hold
up
the
crazy
thing
is
used
my
on
average
maybe
or
times
week
overall
really
enjoyed
this
product
the
sound
quality
is
amazing,
and
the
price
is
lower
than
most
other
competing
brands
love
the
case
especially
because
can
use
it
not
only
to
charge
the
headphones
but
to
charge
my
phone
as
well
the
sound
quality
is
great
did
have
some
challenges
getting
it
to
work
well
during
phone
calls,
but
the
music
quality
makes
my
daily
workout
they
pair
really
easily
just
make
sure
you
take
the
tape
off
the
headphones
otherwise
it
doesn
work
compared
to
other
user
manuels
this
one
is
amazing
the
translation
is
comparatively
on
point
really
happy
with
this
product
and
plan
to
buy
my
sister
one
in
the
near
future
use
earbuds
to
listen
to
podcasts
and
stream
amazon
prime
while
hiking,
these
sound
thin,
all
treble
like
an
old
am
radio
maybe
my
pair
has
an
issue,
but
they
make
the
podcasters
normally
listen
to
sound
unrecognizable
the
functionality
of
the
pairing
and
the
quality
seemed
quite
good
for
the
price,
but
i've
had
bluetooth
earbuds
that
have
far
superior
sound
too
bad
was
looking
forward
to
having
waterproof
pair
of
wireless
earbuds
sound
is
weak
and
it
really
easy
to
accidentally
bump
one
of
them
and
turn
your
music
off
or
unpair
them
they
don
work
like
airpods
that
need
physical
tap
to
operate
if
they
are
touched
by
mistake,
you
ll
make
them
do
something
you
didn
want
to
also,
after
about
week,
the
right
ear
started
putting
out
barely
any
soundvery
annoying
returned
them
for
full
refund
alreadygreat
in
concept,
but
this
is
low
quality
product
took
chance
based
on
friend
recommendation,
but
should
have
when
with
my
gutyou
get
what
you
pay
for
at
first
was
hesitant
to
purchase
from
unfamiliar
brand
but
the
reviews
are
good
enough
that
it
conviced
me
to
buy
it
anyway
so
after
month
of
use
can
really
say
that
it
was
beyond
what
expected
the
battery
life
is
great,
and
the
quality
of
music
is
really
lit
it
doesn't
feel
loose
and
really
comfortable
even
when
go
to
the
gym
really
worth
every
single
penny
the
charging
case
featuring
usb
port
is
also
quite
the
suprise
it
saved
me
couple
times
when
my
phone
loses
battery:
it
maybe
slow
in
the
uptake
but
it
get
the
job
done
pros:
very
easy
to
pair
to
my
iphone
xr
and
both
connect
instantly
every
time
take
them
out
of
the
charger
case
the
touch
functions
for
play/pause
and
advancing
tracks
works
very
well
plenty
of
cone
options
for
the
earpieces
to
fit
many
ear
canal
sizes
blocks
outside
noise
with
snug
fit
fairly
well
allowing
the
music
to
be
heard
even
in
loud
environment
phone
call
quality
is
good
on
both
sides
of
the
call
sound
clarity
is
goodcons:
almost
no
discernible
bass
makes
for
very
tinny
mostly
treble
sound
good
for
voices
but
not
great
for
high
bass
music
like
hiphop
and
hard
rock/metal
etc
excellent
product
at
an
awesome
price
keeps
its
charge
&
very
nice
case
for
easy
charging
although
the
cord
could
be
little
longer
it
was
charged
&
ready
to
use
when
opened
the
box
which
did
&
recommend
trying
the
multiple
ear
size
fittings
beforehand
because
wouldn
have
dropped
it
in
my
casserole
was
making
but
was
able
to
rinse
it
in
water
&
it
still
worked
perfectly
was
able
to
move
around
while
cleaning
&
they
stayed
in
&
we
re
not
heavy
had
great
sound
quality
without
any
adjustments
they
also
have
good
range
so
didn
have
to
keep
my
phone
on
me
great
product
initially
received
defective
pair
it
worked
for
few
months
and
then
had
issuesi
giving
them
stars
because
they
did
originally
live
up
to
its
promise
and
really
enjoyed
themonce
they
stopped
worked
reached
out
to
the
seller
and
they
replaced
themthis
pair
works
great
for
the
price
you
get
very
comfortable,
long
lasting
pair
of
headphones
ve
worn
them
during
half
marathons
with
no
issues
they
fit
well,
connect
to
my
phone
easily
and
sound
fine
listen
to
audiobooks
while
doing
chores
and
eventually
the
earbuds
need
to
be
recharged
so
wanted
another
set
of
earbuds
thought
i'd
try
different
product
since
this
was
my
first
purchase
of
earbuds
ever
went
with
the
tozo
the
tozo
may
have
slightly
crisper
sound
quality,
but
they
are
bulky
and
fall
out
of
my
ear
lot,
and
the
charging
case
needs
to
be
plugged
in
frequently
the
battery
life
on
the
pasanomi
is
phenomenal
bet
don't
have
to
charge
the
case
more
than
once
week
got
lucky
with
my
first
purchase
pasonomi
earbuds
they
are
very
good
product
use
this
for
the
gym
the
only
downside
with
these
is
the
sound
quality
is
absolutely
terrible
unfortunately,
since
they're
headphones,
that's
their
sole
purposethe
silicone
ear
tips
they
come
with
muffle
the
sound
quality
and
make
it
sound
like
$0
bluetooth
speaker
from
distance
no
bass,
no
decent
quality
sound,
or
anything
luckily
had
some
old
tips
from
different
ear
set
had
purchased
on
amazon
for
like
$0
that
completely
changed
the
sound
0%
to
actually
be
decentkeep
in
mind
i'm
total
audiophile
so
i'm
bit
biased
bose
headphones
are
the
only
ones
i'll
use,
except
their
truly
wireless
ones
suck
have
tried
several
different
bluetooth
headphones
and
these
are
handsdown
my
favorite
so
far
each
earbud
has
about
hours
of
battery
life,
which
makes
it
super
convenient
for
my
job,
which
involves
lot
of
driving
there
are
only
really
two
things
can
say
are
negative
about
these
0:
the
only
way
to
turn
them
off
or
on
is
by
taking
them
out
or
putting
them
back
in
the
charging
case,
it
would
nice
if
there
was
way
to
do
so
through
the
touch
commands
0:
one
of
the
touch
commands
in
particular
is
annoying;
by
holding
down
the
touchpad
on
the
earbud,
you
trigger
siri
on
your
phone,
which
is
not
very
useful
when
i'm
trying
to
listen
to
music
other
than
those
things
though,
the
sound
quality
is
very
good,
and
am
very
happy
with
this
purchase
update
since
having
issues
the
company
pasonomi
did
great
job
to
resolve
my
issues
and
provide
me
with
new
working
pair
of
earbuds
thanks
youi
purchased
these
based
off
the
high
reviews
for
walking
every
day
positive
easy
to
pair
to
each
other
and
my
iphone
xr
negative
the
right
earbud
has
mind
of
it's
own
keeps
cutting
in
and
out
when
ever
move
my
head
very
disappointing
keep
trying
to
reestablish
pairing
and
it
still
keeps
cutting
in
and
out
when
your
walking
long
distance
this
is
horrible
the
cord
on
my
iphone
buds
was
not
optimal,
but
this
is
worsesorry
but
very
poor
quality
control
for
$0
item
enjoyed
these
ear
buds
for
year
my
only
original
complaint
when
both
ear
buds
worked
was
the
tinny
sound,
with
little
bass
but
lived
with
it
what
can't
live
with
is
that
now
after
weeks
of
no
use,
they
won't
sync
only
one
ear
bud
at
time
will
sync
can
sync
the
left
and
when
try
to
reset,
then
right
will
sync
but
never
together
i've
reached
out
to
customer
service
asking
for
help,
and
have
received
no
response
have
followed
the
directions
given
for
the
fix
but
nothingfrustrating
do
not
recommend
purchased
these
after
reading
all
of
the
wonderful
reviews
unfortunately,
was
never
able
to
connect
them
to
my
iphone
they
were
complete
waste
of
money
ended
up
purchasing
another
pair
from
different
seller
and
had
no
issues
connecting
them
whatsoever
don
recommend
these
at
all
fit
nice
in
your
ear
and
have
several
sizes
so
you
can
find
your
perfect
size
only
bummer
is
that
even
with
full
charge
can
never
get
them
to
last
longer
than
0hrs
this
wouldn
be
big
deal
if
your
only
working
out,
but
if
you
plan
to
use
them
on
plane
you
ll
run
out
of
juice
mid
flight
and
have
to
put
the
ear
pieces
back
in
their
case
to
charge
these
earbuds
have
very
bad
sound
quality
little
to
no
bass
and
the
noise
cancellation
doesn't
really
work
at
all
the
only
thing
really
liked
about
them
was
that
you
can
change
the
song
by
tapping
the
right
earbud
twice
not
enough
incentive
for
me
to
keep
them
will
definitely
be
returning
these
$0
is
much
too
expensive
for
these
tinny
sounding,
no
bass
earbuds
these
are
supposed
to
be
headphones
that
you
can
wear
in
the
gym
and
not
worry
about
them
quitting
functioning,
but
that
is
what
happened
almost
year
to
the
day
after
purchased
them,
the
right
ear
phone
quit
working
after
way
too
many
back
and
forth
emails
with
the
guy
who
barely
speaks
or
comprehends
the
english
language,
was
advised
that
they
would
not
pay
the
shipping
costs
for
me
to
send
back
the
defective
product
and
have
it
replaced
they
did
not
last
year
of
being
worn
times
week
for
about
an
hour
and
half
in
the
gymother
than
that,
they
were
decent
headphones
for
the
price
but
would
do
yourself
favor
and
spend
the
extra
$0
and
get
more
reputable
brand
with
warranty
that
isn't
garbage
when
first
received
these
headphones
did
not
expect
such
great
quality
for
such
low
price
they
are
easily
accessible
and
extremely
easy
to
pair
the
distance
at
which
they
work
at
was
astonishing
and
not
once
did
the
sound
quality
degrade
used
these
daily
for
almost
days
straight
with
little
to
no
complaints
music
was
incredibly
enjoyable,
without
getting
into
too
much
musical
detail,
acoustic
songs
had
genuine
"raspy"ness
when
strings
were
plucked
and
electric
beats
had
little
to
no
distortion,
sound
quality
in
these
headphones
made
you
hear
the
true
production
value
of
what
was
being
played
whether
it
be
music,
audio
books,
podcasts,
movies,
or
any
other
form
of
media
these
ear
buds
are
perfect
for
me
and
most
kinds
of
people
one
of
those
people
who
constantly
has
there
earbuds
in
and
can
honestly
say
that
these
fit
that
need
perfectly
runner
so
it
is
very
important
for
earbuds
to
not
move
around,
fall
out,
or
be
susceptible
to
water
damage
also
like
the
battery
case
it
comes
in
which
always
you
to
charge
your
earbuds
and
phone
on
the
go
had
my
first
pair
for
six
months
and
they
worked
fine
without
any
issue
until
someone
stole
them
was
so
pleased
with
these
earbuds
that
had
to
buy
another
pair
the
product
comes
with
extra
earbud
tips
to
allow
the
perfect
fit
different
sized
ears
0/0
would
recommend
for
the
price
and
amazing
quality
was
in
the
market
for
good
sounding
wireless
earbuds
that
could
use
for
working
out
and
college
and
this
is
the
first
one
that
stuck
out
for
me
received
them
today
and
my
review
is
based
on
full
hour
of
listening
with
anything
sound
related
it
takes
good
hours
of
playtime
until
you
can
get
the
full
capacity
of
any
speaker
or
earbuds
as
the
drivers
and
things
need
to
warm
up
and
get
loose
they
have
pretty
good
mid
range
sound
similar
to
the
apple
ear
buds
but
without
the
bass
for
me
my
left
bud
overpowers
the
right
one
the
left
ear
bud
has
really
good
sound
and
bass
but
the
right
side
bud
is
way
quieter
and
has
no
bass
at
all
but
the
fact
it
has
the
portable
charger
for
your
phone
is
plus
give
this
four
stars
because
for
the
price
and
what
you
get
it
would
satisfy
me
love
heavy
bass
and
they
have
enough
to
satisfy
me
the
unevenness
of
sound
is
very
distracting
but
mine
might
just
be
lemon
0/0
stars
for
the
potential
and
fact
that
the
left
earbud
sounds
really
good
so
first
off
great
design
love
the
wireless
headphones
that
have
charging
case
these
are
in
my
purse
as
emergency
headphones
for
gym
there
limited
bass
and
sound
isn
amazing,
but
truly
not
bad
at
all
good
quality
for
the
price
if
you
need
precise
crisp
sound
with
bass
you
ll
need
to
spend
significant
amount
of
money
so
these
are
great
as
backups
bought
these
earbuds
at
the
expensive
price
of
$0
know
it's
cheap
when
compared
to
known
and
vetted
manufacturers
of
high
quality
products
but
there
are
lot
of
these
type
of
hitormiss
products
on
amazon
figured
between
the
price
and
good
reviews
had
good
chance
used
these
for
around
months
exclusively
during
short
peloton
workouts
minutes
each
so
less
than
hours
use
they
were
just
fine
sound
was
decent,
battery
life
was
sufficient
for
what
needed,
and
volume
was
ok
now,
the
max
volume
is
0%
less
than
it
ever
was,
and
the
voice
that
tells
you
"connecting"
is
barely
audible
this
makes
them
useless
hope
it's
just
defective
pair
and
everyone
doesn't
have
to
deal
with
this
after
going
through
several
earbuds
have
got
to
give
this
pair
stars
out
of
comfortable,
great
sound,
long
battery
life
hours
of
constant
use
the
no
button
feature
is
simply
amazing
just
tap
it
and
it
turns
on/off
double
tap
for
siri
no
voice
lag
when
watching
videos
the
microphone
is
insanely
awesome
work
in
an
extremely
loud
factory
and
when
my
wife
calls
she
can
hear
me
perfectly
clear
over
the
background
noise
ve
never
been
so
impressed
by
product
these
bluetooth
ear
buds
are
great
they
stay
in
my
ear
and
never
fall
out,
especially
during
my
workout
sessions
bought
these
because
was
tired
of
snagging
my
wired
earbuds
onto
things,
and
always
hated
the
hassle
of
untangling
wired
earbuds
they
have
few
nice
features
as
well;
you're
able
to
control
skipping
to
next
song
or
returning
to
the
previous
song,
pausing,
and
replaying
by
just
tapping
either
the
left
or
right
earbud
all
in
all,
would
recommend
these
for
anyone
who
hates
wired
earbuds
initially
liked
the
earbuds
they
fit
nicely
in
my
ear
sound
quality
is
decent
for
wireless
small
speakers
have
had
no
issues
with
the
battery
life
what
has
been
and
issue
is
connectivity
while
talking
on
the
phone
they
consistently
disconnect
and
reconnect
and
make
using
them
for
phone
call
absolutely
useless
have
to
end
up
turning
off
my
bluetooth
since
usually
don
have
the
case
near
me
they
also
have
issues
having
constant
stream
from
my
phone
even
if
it
in
my
pocket
right
one
has
more
issues
then
left
onei
decided
to
return
them
and
ordered
the
same
ones
hopefully
just
got
defective
pair
will
write
an
update
when
receive
the
new
ones
i've
been
using
these
for
month
now
the
reviews
seemed
stellar
so
had
to
give
these
gopros:
the
battery
life
on
these
guys
is
about
~0hrs
on
one
charge
you
can
use
one
earbud
while
the
other
charges
they're
not
bulky
and
feel
pretty
comfortable
in
my
earscons:
when
work
out
they
do
fall
occasionally
the
sound
quality
is
bit
disappointing,
the
bass
is
very
weak
however,
adjusted
my
audio
settings
on
my
phone
and
it's
tolerable
nowoverall,
think
i'll
keep
these
as
my
spare
i'll
likely
purchase
different
pair
with
better
audio
quality
in
the
near
future
really
like
these
wireless
earbuds
the
box
looks
very
high
techthey
are
super
comfortable
and
have
great
sound
quality
it
charges
very
fastit
easy
to
pair
with
my
phone
and
ipad
and
the
sound
is
very
clear
love
this
producti
would
highly
recommend
these
the
sound
quality
is
very
good
for
the
price
range
also,
they're
light
and
they
fit
extremely
well
they
stay
in
my
ears
even
when
do
cardio
the
battery
life
is
top
notchfor
the
negatives,
the
bluetooth
range
is
not
the
best
and
when
making
calls,
the
individual
on
the
other
line
has
difficulty
hearing
meoverall,
really
impressive
for
around
$0
have
historically
bought
some
wireless
headphones,
but
the
ones
with
wire
between
them,
and
any
headphones
with
wire
find
tend
to
break
faster
than
i'd
like
use
them
lot
these
seem
to
really
fit
the
bill
of
what
i'm
looking
for,
affordable
and
they
look
less
silly
than
the
apple
ear
budsso,
i'm
not
someone
who
knows
how
to
be
overly
picky
about
sound
quality,
but
these
sound
really
good
and
smooth
to
me,
with
good
amount
of
bass
love
the
portable
charging
case
and
how
they
magnetically
snap
in
they're
comfortable
but
don't
feel
like
they'll
fall
out
on
run
did
some
test
jumping
around,
lol
but
the
thing
that
really
gets
me
excited
is
how
great
of
connection
these
maintain
the
pasonomi
bluetooth
earbuds
fit
perfectly
in
adult
ears
recommend
them
for
someone
who
is
very
active
indoors
or
outdoors
work
in
kitchen
and
the
forest
service,
these
earbuds
have
never
let
me
down
the
pasonomi
earbuds
are
waterproof,
so
you
don't
have
to
worry
about
perspiration,
steam,
or
rain
the
sound
quality
is
in
tier
with
name
brand
"wireless"
headphones;
as
is
noise
cancellationthe
only
downside
of
the
pasonomi
earbuds
are
the
battery
life,
however,
it
doesn't
take
long
for
them
to
rechargei
definitely
recommend
0/0
these
headphones
are
surprisingly
comfortable
usually
use
the
wired
headphones
that
came
with
my
ipad,
but
they
actually
make
my
ears
sore
these
earbuds
are
nice
shape
and
dont
make
my
ears
sore
at
all
the
fit
is
great
the
sound
is
really
good
too
i've
watched
videos
at
home,
and
used
for
walk
on
busy
street
both
times
they
were
comfortable
and
great
sound
quality
my
husband
wants
pair
now
too
he
likes
to
run
don
let
the
price
fool
you
ve
had
many
more
expensive
pairs
of
ears
buds
and
these
so
far
has
out
performed
those,
especially
for
the
money
and
had
one
small
issue
that
was
my
fault
and
pasonomi
worked
with
me
to
resolve
the
problem
sounds
is
very
good,
and
decently
loud
can
hear
some
background
noise
at
the
gym
but
not
like
some
others
brands
have
tried
controls
work
very
well
after
you
use
them
some,
little
stiff
and
sensitive
at
first
charging
case
is
awesome
fit
is
light
and
comfortable
in
my
opinion
you
would
have
to
spend
to
times
the
money
to
find
pair
any
better
than
these
bought
these
on
april
0,
0,
was
very
surprised
it
arrived
the
next
day
these
earbuds
fit
comfortably
in
my
ears
unlike
other
brands
love
how
easily
it
was
to
pair
with
my
iphone
the
sound
quality
is
very
good
and
it
didn
fall
out
while
working
out,
which
is
great
always
read
all
the
reviews
and
do
my
research
on
things
buy
for
the
price
would
say
these
are
great
would
love
to
give
this
five
star
rating,
however,
i'm
on
my
second
pair
where
they
just
disconnect
and
reboot
themselves
in
the
middle
of
conversation
have
not
seen
it
done
with
listening
to
music
but
while
on
the
phone
the
earbuds
we
just
reboot
themselves
and
you
have
to
wait
till
that
process
complete
before
they
reconnect
do
love
that
they
fit
in
my
ears
comfortably
and
they
play
sound
through
both
earbuds
simultaneously
hoping
they
workout
bought
other
brands
with
better
ratings
before
these
and
returned
them
both
because
they
just
wouldn't
stay
in
my
ears
these
are
great
regularly
run
with
them
and
never
have
to
adjust
them
once
put
them
in
they
are
also
smaller
than
the
previous
brands,
so
it
doesn't
feel
like
something
heavy
is
awkwardly
hanging
out
of
your
ear
noise
cancellation
is
great;
can't
hear
anyone
once
they
are
in
the
sound
quality
is
great
too,
no
hollow
sound
the
touch
button
features
for
pause,
start,
shuffle,
etc
can
be
bit
sensitive
if
you
brush
against
it,
but
that's
my
only
complaint,
these
are
great
these
are
nice
really
like
not
having
cord
that
gets
snagged
on
everything,
these
have
good
sound
quality
and
are
pretty
convenient
to
have
it
pretty
nice
being
able
to
charge
my
phone
from
their
case
while
on
the
go
had
an
issue
with
the
first
pair
but
the
company
proved
to
be
reliable
and
shipped
me
new
pair
before
was
even
able
to
return
the
old
ones
sound
quality
was
great
the
earbuds
arrived
just
in
time
the
only
bad
thing
can
say
about
them
is
that
they
don't
work
independently
would
like
to
be
able
to
charge
one
while
using
the
other
then
alternate
you
can
use
the
left
one
while
charging
the
right
one
but
if
you
try
to
charge
the
left
one,
the
right
one
shuts
off
was
nervous
at
first
to
get
product
brand
didn
know,
but
in
the
end
really
loved
these
earbuds
for
starters
they
are
very
easy
to
pair
once
they
are
paired
with
your
bluetooth,
they
sync
rather
quickly
the
sound
quality
is
great
love
the
ability
to
listen
to
music
while
doing
things
around
the
house,
and
not
have
to
worry
about
wires
getting
in
the
way
find
other
bluetooth
headphones
that
have
connection
wire
in
the
back
to
be
very
annoying,
and
these
fit
so
perfectly
have
small
ears,
so
was
little
nervous,
but
they
fit
great
the
battery
life
for
me
is
great,
especially
since
don
really
have
them
in
for
longer
than
couple
hours
to
clean
around
the
house,
but
the
added
bonus
of
the
charging
case
is
wonderful
not
to
mention,
have
dogs
that
get
into
everything
so
having
the
case
is
extrememly
helpful
all
in
all
this
is
great
product
and
would
definitely
recommend
it
these
earbuds
work
as
advertised
and
are
indeed
waterproof
use
them
most
days
for
my
runs
and
they
last
between
0hrs
before
needing
to
recharge
my
first
pair
was
working
well
for
0mths
but
then
the
left
ear
wouldn't
charge
for
some
reason
suspect
it
was
because
should
be
cleaning
these
more
than
once
week
however,
contacted
customer
service
and
was
sent
new
pair
after
trying
to
clean
both
earbuds
and
charger
very
happy
with
this
purchase
very
easy
to
pair
came
with
earpieces
to
adjust
the
size
fits
good
in
my
ear
which
has
been
an
issue
with
previous
ear
buds
nice
charging
box
that
has
an
additional
usb
port
guess
to
charge
your
phone
as
well
didn't
have
to
charge
very
long
when
first
got
them
so
i'm
thinking
it
has
good
battery
life
would
definately
recommend
this
product
they
work
super
well
so
far,
exactly
as
stated,
and
my
best
friend
also
has
pair
that
he
got
year
ago
that
are
still
going
strong
for
him
as
well
haven
even
used
my
beats
in
while
because
these
are
so
much
more
convenient
when
want
something
smaller
the
sound
quality
is
absolutely
amazing,
genuinely
have
no
complaints
so
far
i'd
previously
had
cheaper
earbud
and
thought
i'd
go
up
in
price
point
to
see
if
could
find
product
that
had
better
sound
quality,
and
had
longer
battery
life
these
turned
out
to
be
just
okthough
these
earbuds
were
better
in
sound
quality
and
had
longer
battery
life,
encountered
problem
had
not
anticipated
cannot
seem
to
control
them
from
the
buds
themselves,
so
can't
pause
have
to
pause
from
my
phone,
and
that
is
not
always
convenient
the
infuriating
thing
is
as
soon
as
pause
it,
it
senses
the
phone
and
starts
to
play
again
automatically
so
frustrating
think
when
first
got
it,
left
the
buds
on
my
nightstand,
and
it
played
my
music
throughout
the
night
no
buenosadly,
would
not
get
these
again
the
earbuds
received
had
connection
issues
and
once
they
were
connected,
they
kept
cutting
out
also,
the
sound
quality
was
not
as
good
as
was
expecting
attempted
to
contact
customer
support
by
email,
but
never
received
reply
the
"guarantee
card"
sent
with
these
only
has
an
email
and
facebook
contact,
no
phone
number
there
are
better
options
out
there
for
less
money
have
started
return
on
these
and
purchased
elecitizon
bluetooth
earbuds
highly
rated
on
amazon
and
like
them
much
better
they
do
have
wires
connected
to
piece
worn
around
the
neck,
but
they
are
less
expensive,
sound
better,
stay
connected,
and
the
battery
lasts
much
longer
on
single
charge
bought
these
months
ago
they
have
very
good
sound
quality
and
was
very
happy
with
them
after
0/0
months,
the
bluetooth
connectivity
began
to
be
spotty
with
phone
in
my
pocket,
the
earbuds
cut
out
regularly
to
the
point
that
have
to
hold
the
phone
in
my
hand
by
my
ear
in
order
for
them
to
work
without
interruption
like
these
but
not
practical
with
the
bluetooth
issueupdate;
emailed
customer
service
and
they
immediately
responded
with
technical
support
to
reset
earbuds
they
work
great
now
these
earbuds
were
great
right
out
of
the
box
fully
charged
and
ready
to
go
they
were
easy
to
pair
with
each
other
and
with
my
phone
initial
charge
out
of
the
box
lasted
hours
with
constant
use
and
then
only
took
hour
to
charge
againi
love
the
charger
it
both
charger
and
storage
box
all
in
one
forever
losing
earbuds
so
this
concept
should
keep
them
safei
do
wish
that
they
got
more
range
so
could
walk
further
away
from
my
phone
while
listening
also
the
sound
could
be
little
crisper
but
for
the
price,
these
are
great
buy
have
held
off
buying
bt
earbuds,
did
some
research
before
decided
on
thesei
found
them
to
be
easy
to
setup
and
pair
with
my
phone
and
soundbar
charged
them
the
first
day
received
them,
i'm
on
my
fifth
day
and
they
are
still
playing
strongthe
material
is
substantial
and
well
made
the
charging
cube
is
just
the
right
size
and
easy
to
read
the
buds
also
came
with
many
rubber
coversi
strongly
recommend
these
buds:
love
these
bluetooth
earbud
so
far
use
them
to
listen
to
music
in
the
office
at
work
the
volume
level
is
good
and
they
stay
in
my
ears
well
my
mom
used
to
tell
me
had
small
ears
and
most
other
ear
buds
like
to
fall
out
the
charging
box
holds
charge
for
very
long
time
and
the
earbuds
charge
fast
don't
have
to
wait
hours
between
charges
to
listen
to
music
again
i'm
not
sure
how
noise
cancelling
these
really
are,
but
they
do
block
significant
amount
of
sound
when
fitted
correctly
very
happy
with
these
have
been
looking
for
reliable
headphones
for
while
have
an
iphone
and
these
headphones
pair
perfectly
every
time
extremely
easy
to
operate
and
recharge
the
headphones
notify
me
when
they
need
to
be
recharged
spend
lot
of
time
on
the
phone
for
work
and
love
to
listen
to
music,
that
means
the
headphones
need
to
be
comfortable
and
reliable
look
no
further,
get
these
and
live
life
on
your
terms
overall,
generally
liked
these
they
were
comfortable
and
had
pretty
reasonable
sound
quality
the
microphone
is
almost
useless,
but
didn't
buy
it
for
that
unfortunately,
these
have
the
same
issue
pretty
much
all
the
bluetooth
earbuds
i've
tried
have
they
work
great
until
get
to
the
gym
and
then
they
constantly
cutout
because
so
many
other
people
have
headsets
too
ended
up
returning
since
the
gym
was
my
primary
use
case
these
are
great
set
of
bluetooth
earbuds
for
the
price
they're
comfortable,
easy
to
use
and
look
good
the
only
downside
for
me
is
the
sound
quality
which
isn't
the
greatest,
however
for
the
price
overall
i'm
happy
with
these
definitely
recommend
them
after
buying
them,
for
days
they
were
amazing
the
sound
quality
was
loud
in
both
buds
including
the
base
pairing
one
bud
automatically
connected
to
the
other
leaving
synchronized
music
playing
after
two
weeks,
the
pairing
for
buds
was
difficult
have
an
s0
which
allows
me
to
double
pair,
so
had
to
pair
the
buds
separatly
the
sound
went
crazy
meaning
one
bud
would
be
loud
then
sometimes
it
won't
sometimes,
the
buds
would
fall
out
of
snyc
leaving
the
music
to
play
at
different
times
the
charging
dosen't
take
long
for
the
buds,
but
it
took
two
hours
for
the
case
after
two
weeksoverall,
they're
pretty
good
for
days,
but
it
won't
last
had
them
for
more
than
month
they
are
better
than
the
bose
wanted
something
that
had
stereo
sound
phone
calls
and
after
purchasing
the
bose,
sony,
and
jlab
all
$0
the
pasonomi
were
by
far
the
best
and
they
were
pretty
reasonable
price
read
all
the
reviews
and
it
took
month
to
finally
order
them
because
just
couldn
make
decision
was
worried
because
they
were
inexpensive
but
the
quality
was
better
than
thought
they
would
be
the
case
even
has
usb
plug
so
you
can
charge
your
phone
from
its
battery
this
is
the
best
wireless
earbud
have
purchased
this
year
and
purchased
many
the
buds
fit
snugly
in
the
ear
and
do
not
fall
or
move
out
place
no
matter
the
activity
have
very
active
lifestyle
and
it's
good
to
have
earbud
that
fits
securely,
actually
has
nice
cancellation
properties,
moisture
wicking
properties
and
decent
battery
life
furthermore
can
walk
away
from
my
phone
approximately
to
ft
and
still
have
reception
the
only
issue
would
say
have
with
it
is
the
touch
sensitivity
when
it
comes
to
pausing
video
by
tapping
the
ear
bud
sometimes
it
sometimes
it
works
perfectly
other
times
it
doesnt
could
be
moisture
on
my
finger
interfering
with
the
sensor
but
still
not
enough
for
me
to
dislike
it
this
is
definitely
most
buy
am
disappointed
in
these
ear
buds
first,
they
have
approximately
hour
battery
life
the
left
unit
stays
in
my
ear,
but,
the
right
has
been
known
to
fall
out
will
be
going
back
to
the
horse
shoe
bluetooth
headset
with
retractable
earbuds,
longer
battery
life
and
if
one
falls
out,
it
is
tethered
the
headphones
are
good
sound
is
great,
battery
is
fantastic,
and
live
the
fact
can
use
them
separately
the
extra
large
battery
for
charging
your
phone
means
that
rarely
have
to
charge
the
case
often
use
one
headphone
and
the
swap
it
for
the
other
when
the
battery
gets
low
with
this
cycle
can
play
music
all
day
with
no
interruptionto
top
it
all
off,
their
customer
support
through
facebook
messenger
was
fantastic
had
an
insane
in
which
the
headphones
stopped
pairing
with
each
other
could
use
each
one
separately,
but
could
not
use
them
in
stereo
the
customer
service
went
above
and
beyond
to
not
only
resolve
he
issue
but
make
sure
was
sattisfiedthe
only
downside
is
the
call
quality
it
will
definitely
get
by
in
pinch,
but
often
have
to
hand
the
call
off
to
my
phone
as
the
person
on
the
other
side
complains
they
can
hear
me
well
am
very
happy
with
these
earbuds
bought
them
for
running
and
to
connect
to
my
samsung
fit
pro
watch,
and
they
work
really
well
so
use
them
when
not
running
also
they
were
easy
to
pair
and
connect
automatically
when
you
remove
them
from
their
case
the
case
has
an
internal
battery
that
charges
the
earbuds
automatically
they
are
touch
sensitive
which
works
well
to
pause
and
skip
tracks
the
only
negative
thing
can
say
about
them
is
that
the
earphones
are
not
the
absolute
best
in
terms
of
sound
quality,
but
they
are
quite
good,
better
sounding
than
most
of
the
other
earbuds
wired
have
tried
the
earbuds
seemed
to
have,
for
the
most
part,
good
reviews
and
wasn't
interested
in
investing
lot
of
money
in
anything
expensive
so
went
with
these
work
in
very
loud
environment
and
even
with
one
earbud
in,
can
hear
my
music
well
and
it
helps
the
night
go
by
faster
however,
there
is
absolutely
no
bass
so
that
was
killer
for
me
the
pairing
was
easy
to
do
but
the
battery
doesn't
last
very
long
before
it
needs
to
charge
they
are
decent
if
you
are
looking
for
something
as
background
noise
but
don't
buy
these
if
you're
looking
for
something
amazingyou
will
be
very
disappointed
very
pleased
with
these
headphones
as
just
bough
my
second
pair
for
my
wife
reviews
are
very
important
when
deciding
between
one
product
vs
another
can
say
with
confidence
that
these
headphones
perform
exactly
as
described
and
most
importantly
they
stay
snug
in
the
ear
while
running,
walking,
or
just
working
around
house
sound
quality
is
great
the
design
of
the
charging
case
is
very
convenient
the
best
part
for
me
was
the
price
initially
the
headphone
were
the
best
but
not
after
using
them
for
few
months
the
issues
arise
the
headphone
do
not
work
unless
you
have
the
charging
box
base
station
with
you
to
relay
the
audio
additionally
the
headphone
would
randomly
disconnect
from
the
charging
station
and
connect
to
you
phone
which
would
either
cut
off
calls
or
music
on
aux
in
your
car
after
few
months
of
usage
would
not
recommend
this
brand
due
to
these
two
main
issues
bought
this
in
april
0,
it
february
and
one
headphone
no
longer
works
didn
even
last
me
year
and
actually
didn
even
use
them
often
because
couldn
use
the
microphone
poor
quality
and
no
one
talked
to
could
ever
hear
me
right
they
were
nice
because
they
were
compact
and
came
in
nice
case
but
in
the
not
worth
it
they
are
good
enough
to
bail
on
his
jbl
overear
headset
and
my
skull
candy
over
ear
he
previously
lost
pair
of
expensive
samsung
earbuds
and
tons
of
cheap
knockoffs
that
are
wired
together
but
bluetooth
initially
tried
to
replace
mine
with
jbuds
version
and
found
tons
of
issues
with
those
should
have
reordered
these
and
we'd
have
two
to
sharethe
battery
with
usb
port
in
case
helps
him
charge
his
phone
without
carrying
another
battery
researched
several
options
for
truly
wireless
earbuds
off
and
on
over
several
weeks
and
finally
decided
on
pasonomi
am
very
pleased
with
my
decision
think
that
if
you
set
your
expectations
accordingly
you
will
find
that
these
earbuds
are
very
good
you
can
not
expect
the
fullness
of
sound
and
bass
that
larger
earphones
would
provide
nor
the
crystal
clear
phone
calls
that
earphones
with
microphone
located
near
your
mouth
might
providei
bought
these
for
hands
free
phone
calls,
travelling,
yard
work
and
for
the
gym
they
have
performed
well
in
all
applications
music
sound
is
good,
can
hear
people
clearly
on
phone
calls
and
the
person
on
the
other
line
can
hear
me
clearly
with
the
quality
being
similar
to
using
my
bluetooth
in
my
car
they
stay
secure
while
working
in
the
yard
and
in
the
gym
even
better,
barely
notice
them
during
workoutsthey
do
not
cancel
all
of
the
noise
from
loud
airplane,
but
didn't
expect
them
to
perform
in
this
wayi
would
definitely
buy
them
again
and
recommend
them
to
my
friends
these
headphones
are
very
annoying
to
wear
because
the
right
earbud
always
cuts
out
rarely
will
it
work
well
so
most
of
the
time
you
have
to
listen
to
only
the
left
earbud
it's
shame
because
the
design
is
pretty
decent
they
don't
stay
in
my
ears
very
well,
but
don't
do
much
physical
activity
so
usually
can
find
sweet
spot
it
just
takes
little
bit
the
battery
is
very
good,
and
love
the
concept
of
the
usb
port
on
the
case
have
friend
who
has
these
headphones
and
he
also
has
an
issue
with
the
right
earbud
coming
in
and
out
of
signal
if
you
can
increase
the
transmit
power
of
the
left
earbud
i'm
assuming
this
is
the
master
earbud
then
these
headphones
would
be
very
good
purchase,
but
as
this
is
not
the
case,
it's
waste
of
money
if
it's
possible
to
implement
technology
where
the
sound
quality
of
both
buds
decreases
if
the
signal
isn't
good
enough
instead
of
completely
cutting
the
audio
signal
to
the
right
bud,
that
would
be
much
better
that
product
is
freak
hot,
working
excellent,
special
like
driing,
if
you
want
to
listen
to
drive,
and
not
distract
,
shose
this
one
also
this
come
weih
small
boxes
and
charge
your
ear
buds
also
is
easy
to
set
upto
use
and
the
most
important
thing
for
me
the
qulity
of
the
sound
like
cystal
and
strong
suoporting
bass
sound,
also
is
easier
to
use
to
music
am
really
haapy
to
get
this
one
,
is
worh
it
to
get
this
product
more
,and
their
brand
customer
service
worked
with
me,
my
initial
pair
had
some
issues
have
had
my
earbuds
for
week
now
and
would
like
to
share
my
thoughtsfirst
right
out
of
the
charger
they
were
by
far
the
easiest
to
pair
with
my
iwatch
took
them
out
of
the
charger,
they
immediatly
paired
with
each
other,
looked
them
up
on
my
bluetooth
and
paired
with
no
delay
now
when
take
them
out
of
the
charger
they
immediatly
pair
with
my
iwatch
they
hold
thier
charge
thourgh
out
my
hour
workout
they
periodically
drop
but
pair
right
back
up
they
have
held
up
wuite
well
with
as
much
as
sweat
which
is
ton
my
only
wish
is
that
they
had
more
bass
but
still
great
buy
love
these
earbuds
this
is
my
first
pair
of
wireless
earbuds
and
they
are
good
actually
bought
pairs
and
tested
them
out
both
but
ended
up
returning
th
others
and
keeping
these
love
the
snug
fit
the
sound
quality
is
good
and
the
are
for
sure
waterproof
already
dropped
my
by
accident
in
the
sink
and
they
are
working
just
fine
no
real
complaints
about
the
headphones
like
how
you
can
connect
to
one
headphone
at
time,
which
is
great
if
two
people
want
to
use
only
one
at
the
same
time
wish
the
battery
life
is
longer,
but
the
charge
time
is
fast
and
you
get
multiple
charges
from
the
base
without
having
to
recharge
the
base
itself
overall
i'm
happy
with
my
purchase
ordered
two
pair
for
my
wife
and
to
run
in
they're
not
comfortable,
the
sound
is
horrendous
and
they're
poorly
made
returned
both
pair
after
trying
to
run
in
them
there
is
zero
bass,
they
sound
awful
do
not
buy
went
ahead
and
decided
to
get
jabra's
which
were
more
expensive
but
sound
incredible
and
you
can
control
the
eq
and
pass
through
buy
the
jabra
elites,
even
if
you
buy
them
used
the
half
the
price
don't
buy
these
turds
bought
these
headphones
two
months
ago
they
were
great
at
first,
but
now
they
glitch
and
cut
out
lot
it
doesn't
happen
all
the
time,
but
i'd
say
about
0%
of
the
time
sometimes
it
happens
right
when
they
turn
on,
or
it
happens
after
i've
been
listening
for
while
really
like
them
otherwise,
but
it's
frustrating
when
can't
catch
half
of
the
song
or
audiobook
that
i'm
trying
to
listen
to
usually,
listen
to
music
when
i'm
frustrated
and
need
break
from
the
outside
world
it
doesn't
really
work
when
can't
actually
listen
to
music
i'll
probably
buy
new
headphones
from
different
company
because
these
weren't
worth
my
money
the
pasonomi
bluetooth
wireless
earbuds
fit
my
ears
nicely
they
are
easy
to
carry,
easy
to
charge
and
the
battery
life
seems
real
good
the
sound
quality
is
not
as
good
as
expensive
over
the
ear
earphones,
however
had
no
expectations
that
they
would
be
they
are
very
adequate
for
my
everyday
listening
have
uploaded
bunch
of
music
and
listen
to
it
lot
with
these
new
earbuds
am
very
happy
with
them
have
to
update
this
review,
customer
service
send
me
an
email
and
replace
the
defective
unit
at
not
cost
even
though
it
was
after
the
days
thank
you
pasonami
i'm
impressed
the
following
is
my
original
review
only
used
the
earbuds
for
couple
of
times
while
doing
some
weight
training
and
there
were
ok,
but
then
about
week
ago
decided
to
use
them
while
jogging
and
walking
and
sound
was
cutting
off
all
the
time,
tried
to
unpair
and
pair
again
and
again
and
finalize
realize
maybe
just
had
bad
set
unfortunately
my
window
to
returned
them
closed
days
ago
my
mistake
thought
had
an
other
week
guess
not
all
of
them
are
going
to
be
good
and
have
to
track
my
purchase
date
better
in
the
future
in
the
mean
time
i'll
keep
them
and
be
as
immobile
as
can
while
i'm
listening
to
them
love
these,
these
are
awesome
but
unfortunately
lost
one
of
the
ear
buds
when
was
out
for
run
is
there
way
could
get
replacement
of
the
one
lostedit*i
emailed
them
and
got
replacement
sent
to
me
but
don't
know
how
to
sync
them
together,
they
aren't
synced
together
and
play
millisecond
apart
from
each
otheredit
**ok
went
to
their
facebook
page
and
found
out
how
to
sync
them
good
great
sound
quality;
excellent
base
for
wireless
headphones
once
you
install
the
right
rubber
tip,
the
headphones
will
not
fall
out
use
them
to
workout
frequently
and
have
never
had
problem
reasonable
pricebad
very
serious
connectivity
issues
work
in
central
business
district
surrounded
by
tall
buildings,
subways,
and
lots
of
people
when
walking
around
near
my
office,
or
anywhere
that
matches
the
characteristics
described
in
the
last
sentence,
the
headphones
are
unusable
spoke
to
customer
service,
and
they
informed
me
that
this
was
common
problem
once
i'm
back
inside
my
office
and
at
my
desk,
the
connection
is
great
but
this
is
big
problem
battery
life
is
pretty
short;
between
hoursoverall:
if
you
don't
live
or
work
in
major
city,
these
might
be
good
option
for
you
otherwise,
would
look
into
other
companies
purchased
these
earbuds
about
months
ago,
and
have
enjoyed
them
tremendously
the
sound
quality
is
great,
and
use
them
one
bud
at
time
to
listen
to
news,
podcasts,
music
etc
when
the
battery
in
the
bud
i'm
using
gets
low,
swap,
and
since
they
charge
faster
than
they're
depleted,
i'm
never
without
working
earbud
throughout
the
day
use
them
for
everything
running,
hiking,
working
around
the
house
and
phone
calls
they're
super
comfortable
now
here's
the
kicker
about
week
ago,
had
problem
with
one
of
the
buds,
and
so
contacted
the
company
pasonomi
contacted
me
within
day,
sent
me
clear
diagnostic
instructions,
and
totally
took
care
of
me
this
well
priced
product
that
works
exactly
as
advertised,
and
has
super
customer
support
to
back
it
up
highly
recommended
these
are
great
headphones
for
working
out
they
stay
in
the
ear
easily
and
sound
is
good
bass
is
fine
if
it
is
really
in
your
ear,
but
do
find
the
come
out
loose
enough
that
don't
experience
the
bass
feel
that
wellthe
charging
case
is
awesome
and
rarely
hit
the
battery
limit
while
using
them
granted,
don't
used
them
for
long
sessions,
but
for
working
out,
watching
show,
they
are
finelost
one
of
them
and
immediately
bought
another
pair
worth
the
price
so
far,
my
first
impression
of
these
is
very
positive
right
out
of
the
box
they
come
charged
or
at
least
mine
did
so
you
can
jump
right
into
using
them
pairing
them
was
almost
instantaneous
you
can
pair
them
to
your
phone,
and
pc
which
is
what
did
and
they
worked
great
the
design
is
solid,
they
feel
strong
and
the
quality
is
excellent
also
went
for
run
and
they
did
stay
in
place
and
did
not
have
to
adjust
them
at
all
the
instructions
are
clear
and
the
product
description
on
the
pamphlet
is
clear
and
lets
you
know
what
to
expect
bought
these
for
listening
to
music
and
that's
it
so
from
that
standpoint,
say
if
you
are
looking
at
these
and
want
something
specifically
for
listening
to
music,
go
for
it
purchased
these
for
my
husband
and
just
like
my
previous
pair,
they
are
great
can
use
several
times
before
have
to
charge,
they
sound
great
and
come
with
several
sizes
of
cushions
to
make
sure
you
get
great
fit
mine
are
still
going
strong
would
recommend
these
to
anyone
who
doesn't
want
to
spend
an
ton
to
get
good
set
the
sound
quality
is
excellent
the
form
of
these
earbuds
are
such
that
it
is
quick
and
easy
to
get
complete
seal
in
your
ear
canal
and
they
stay
securely
in
place
because
of
this
easy
fit,
background
noise
is
suppressed
quite
well
iuse
then
almost
daily
and
charge
them
only
once
month
absolutely
love
this
ear
buds
super
simple
to
use,
stay
in
well,
connect
everytimei
give
it
stars
because
i've
been
using
them
consistently
since
christmas
and
sadly
the
right
earbud
is
going
out
the
sound
is
very
very
quiet
from
that
bud
and
cannot
for
the
life
of
me
figure
out
way
to
fix
it
would
love
some
support
overall
it
not
bad
but
when
answer
call
the
person
always
says
they
can
hear
me
and
sound
muffled
got
them
so
wouldn
have
to
take
the
earbuds
so
it
hard
to
give
it
star
if
you
only
use
it
to
listen
to
music
or
watch
show
it
sounds
great
even
jogging
was
good
but
don
like
the
muffled
problem
first,
the
battery
life
for
this
pairs
of
earbuds
is
really
impressive
use
it
mostly
for
the
gym,
so
the
play
time
was
sufficient,
and
usually
only
have
to
charge
it
once
week
it
connects
easily
with
my
huawei
and
stay
connected
without
getting
dropped
the
build
quality
of
this
headset
is
also
superb,
very
solid
and
elegant
next
is
the
sound
quality,
it
sounds
incredibly
nice
and
crisp
have
not
attempt
to
test
out
the
waterproof
capability
yet,
but
as
for
water
resistance
sweat
it
did
very
nice
job
really
tried
giving
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
and
ordered
despite
bad
reviews
low
and
behold
only
after
months
the
right
bud
has
stopped
working
charge
also
not
holding
more
than
hours
too
late
to
return
but
at
least
can
save
you
the
money
don't
buy
these
as
many
other
reviewers
have
posted,
the
quality
of
these
are
amazing
was
pleasantly
surprised
when
first
used
them
was
bit
worried
about
not
having
something
to
loop
around
the
ear
to
keep
them
in
place
but
that
hasn't
been
an
issuei
mainly
use
them
while
at
the
gym
or
when
i'm
out
and
abouthaving
the
portable
charging
case
is
nice
value
add
i've
had
them
for
little
over
weeks
and
haven't
needed
to
recharge
the
case
i'm
very
happy
with
my
purchase
and
would
highly
recommend
these
do
not
advise
anybody
to
buy
this
item
purchase
x0
wireless
earbuds
and
have
had
nothing
but
problems
since
went
through
the
company
and
they
sent
me
second
pair
and
the
same
exact
thing
happened
to
the
second
pair
that
happened
to
the
first
pair
after
while
the
volume
goes
all
the
way
down
you
cannot
hear
the
person
you're
talking
to
on
the
phone
and
you
can
barely
hear
the
music
it
does
not
allow
you
to
turn
the
volume
up
something
is
wrong
with
this
device
and
they
don't
fix
it
they
just
keep
sending
you
replacements
but
when
your
year
is
up
they
don't
send
you
another
replacement
you
just
get
stuck
with
garbage
actually
have
no
clue
about
battery
life,
the
set
received
was
not
of
good
quality
found
sucked,
connecting
to
my
iphone
was
crapshoot,
it
always
had
to
be
paired
up
to
my
phone
like
it
was
the
first
time
used
might
have
been
the
exception
and
these
are
actually
great
but
that
was
clearly
not
the
case
in
the
pair
had
simply
put,
don't
waste
your
money
**update~
dead
earbud
suddenly
started
working
again
have
no
idea
why
it
decided
to
take
charge
again
weirdwell
these
were
awesome
while
they
lasted
great
sound
quality,
good
outside
noise
cancellation,
love
wireless
but,
unfortunately,
after
only
months
the
right
earbud
is
dead
and
won't
charge;
and
this
was
only
with
occasional
use
never
dropped,
never
rough
with
them
put
the
earbud
in
the
case
to
charge,
the
case
says
it's
charging
but
the
earbud
doesn't
after
what
paid
for
them
am
extremely
disappointed
thought
they
would
last
longer
than
the
everdisposable
wired
ones
guess
not
love
these
bluetooth
headphones
they
charge
up
quickly,
and
love
that
the
case
can
be
used
as
backup
charger
for
my
phone
also
love
the
sound
quality
my
husband
even
took
them
to
work,
and
said
they
were
great
they
hold
charge
pretty
well
would
definitely
recommend
these
to
anyone
looking
to
go
wireless
these
may
not
have
the
best
sound
quality,
compared
to
much
more
expensive
ones,
but
for
the
price
they
are
really
nice
bought
two
sets
for
the
price
of
one,
more
expensive
one
use
them
for
working
out
and
the
charge
lasted
long
time
they
paired
easily
to
my
phone
and
fit
nice
in
the
ears
think
the
case
helps
keep
them
charged
do
wish
can
figure
out
how
am
turning
them
off
once
in
while
think
there
is
capacitive
touch
button
on
an
ear
piece,
couldn't
find
this
feature
in
the
instructions
bought
these
for
my
boyfriend
for
his
birthday
to
run
in
he
was
tired
of
having
cords
bouncing
around
his
shoulders
was
nervous
to
buy
him
these
at
first,
afraid
he
would
lose
them,
but
he
loves
them
he
says
they
fit
in
his
ear
perfectly
and
never
move,
and
very
easy
to
use
my
parents
recently
got
an
interest
in
wireless
earphones,
and
chose
to
get
these
pairs
once
we
received
them
and
tested
it
out,
can
affirm
that
these
are
superb
use
to
own
another
company's
wireless
earbuds,
and
although
the
sound
quality
was
good,
it
hurt
to
wear
them
because
they
didn't
fit
snug;
however,
pasonomi's
earbuds
are
fantastic
they
fit
snug
right
into
your
ears
they
have
great
audio
quality
along
with
comprehensive
instruments
recommend
this
product
for
my
purposes,
this
was
great
purchase
inexpensive,
battery
lasts
forever,
fit
well
and
when
operating,
absolutely
pleasant
experience
when
have
had
few
issues,
emailed
customer
service
and
they
were
terrific
responsive,
clear
i'm
big
fanif
had
complaints,
they
are
not
super
intuitive
part
of
it
is
user
error
for
sure
this
is
new
tech
and
i'm
not
patient
man
each
type
of
blinking
light
means
something
different
they
do
not
always
automatically
sync
to
each
other
so
need
to
read
the
directions
and/or
email
customer
service,
set
up
the
buds
againoverall,
this
was
terrific
option
for
me
and
am
very
satisfied
these
headphone
will
pause
music
if
there
is
an
*extreme*
breeze
the
tap
touch
feature
is
great
otherwise
however
the
inability
to
function
in
the
wind
makes
me
rate
these
0/0tried
to
turn
them
off
and
on
few
times
and
they
are
still
sensitive
tho
not
as
bad,
however
in
extreme
wind
these
don't
stay
on
these
headphones
won't
stay
at
equal
volumes
thought
at
first
that
maybe
needed
to
clean
them,
but
after
gently
wiping
the
ear
buds
with
rubbing
alcohol
and
ensuring
that
the
alcohol
didn't
make
it
into
any
of
the
internals,
the
volume
still
won't
equalize
in
the
right
ear
also,
there
ear
bud
coverings
are
extremely
slippery
can't
go
running
more
than
about
minutes
without
having
to
constantly
adjust
them
the
only
decent
thing
is
that
if
they
sit
in
your
ears
properly
you
get
pretty
good
noise
cancellation
quite
frankly
i'm
most
upset
that
the
issues
started
occurring
in
the
second
month
after
purchase,
making
it
fall
outside
of
the
return
policy
for
amazon
have
been
in
the
market
for
some
bluetooth
headphones
for
while
and
i'm
glad
received
these
for
my
birthday
wanted
them
to
use
while
running
good
distance
these
head
phones
were
perfect
they
were
loud
enough
and
cancelled
out
the
gym
music
that
is
usually
blaring
they
also
never
fell
out
of
my
ear
at
all
the
little
box
it
comes
in
is
nice
it
tells
you
how
charged
the
head
phones
are
while
also
charging
them
if
they
need
it
never
had
any
issues
connecting
the
headphines
to
each
other
or
my
phobe
it
was
always
very
easy
to
do
all
in
all
was
very
satisfied
with
this
product
and
would
definitely
recommend
great
quality
for
the
price
these
earbuds
are
perfect
for
those
of
us
with
work
stations
that
have
lot
going
on
was
so
tired
of
wires
getting
caught
in
my
work
or
the
dreaded
moment
when
you
forget
you
have
them
on
and
get
up,
thus
pulling
the
cord
and
computer/phone
with
you
these
eliminate
those
issues
and
sound
great
can
now
walk
around
my
office
freely
the
battery
life
is
great
so
far
and
i've
had
no
issues
pairing
them
with
bluetooth
on
any
devices
honestly,
disappointedthey
fit
excellently,
and
the
sound
quality
is
goodthe
battery

complete
joke
barely
get
hrs
out
of
it
before
it
just
turns
off
by
itself0

really
it
had
been
charging
the
entire
night

another
product

what
happened
was

ve
been
using
them
ever
since
and
the
battery

is
phenomenali
love
them
after
reading
the
reviews
decided
to
purchase
this
earbud
and
i'm
glad
did
they
are
perfect
fit,
stay
in
place
and
the
sound
is
fantastic
was
very
impressed
with
the
sound
quality
of
the
phone
calls
because
some
people
had
mentioned
they
were
not
that
great
have
an
andriod
phone
and
the
clarity
on
the
calls
was
great
i'
will
purchase
this
product
again
and
for
sure
these
will
make
great
gifts
for
our
entire
family
this
is
my
first
pair
of
wireless
earbuds
that
use
for
commuting
between
work

that

these
were
about
attempt
while
after
hour
was
impressed
with
how
they
stayed
in
and
did
not
hurt
my
ears
thought
that
finally
find
pair
to
last
until
they
shut
off
on

so
much
for

i'll
give
them
another
full

and
change
my
review
of
they
last
longer
for
my
next
big
walkafter
about
month,
never
got
more
than
two
hour
charge
and
as
of
today,
the
right
one
quit
working
at
least
can
still
use
the
left
since
it
is
the
controlling
bud
won't
buy
again
after
my
other
ear
buds
got
stolen
from
the
gym,
quickly
turned
to
these
as
suggestion
from
friend
def
not
disappointed
sound
is
fantastic,
and
loud
enough
to
drown
out
any
mild
background
noise
the
case
doubles
as
charge
pack
also
pairing
was
breezeas
soon
as
you
take
it
out
the
case
it
ready
to
pair
on
the
bluetooth
menu
any
time
after
that
it
auto
pairs
with
my
iphone0
the
right
earbud
stopped
working
right
you
can
still
hear
sound
but
it
is
so
muted
that
if
your
walking,
it
too
much
noise
to
hear
can
tell
that
the
left
side
is
starting
to
get
quieter
toothey
also
don
connect
to
each
other
anymore
they
pair
separately
to
my
phone
and
will
not
play
music
at
the
same
time
they
act
like
two
completely
different
devicesjuly0edit:
the
company
reached
out
to
me
and
sent
me
replacement
set
of
earbuds
am
still
testing
them
out
and
will
update
in
month
or
two
my
experience
with
this
earbud
was
excellent
they
fit
in
my
ear
very
well,
they
pair
with
my
device
fast
and
can
roam
into
my
apartment
away
from
the
tv
that
have
connected
with
even
in
another
room
the
sound
in
difinitly
better
than
older
bluetooth
devices
that
had
occasionally,
give
my
wife
one
ear
bud
and
use
the
other
so
we
can
both
listen
to
the
same
audio
overall
am
satisfied
customer
these
are
the
best
wireless
earbuds
that
i've
ever
had
i'm
fighter
and
never
have
had
pair
that
would
stay
in
my
ear
during
some
of
my
workouts
until
these
so
accidentally
left
one
in
my
pocket
and
threw
my
pants
in
the
washing
machine
and
then
throw
them
in
the
dryer
after
was
done
washing
and
drying
them
lol
they
blink
red
for
little
bit
then
stopped
working
for
an
hour
now
they're
good
as
new
these
things
are
tough
little
suckers
along
with
the
perfect
fit
in
my
ear,blocks
out
noise,great
quality
sound,
fast
connectivity,
easy
touch
control,
and
love
that
they
are
waterproof
and
definitely
tested
that
out
think
the
only
reason
they
didn't
work
for
an
hour
was
because
they
were
overheated
by
the
dryer
should
have
called
the
tough
stuff
charging
case
is
plus
also
these
earbuds
are
incredible
it
shipped
to
me
on
time
in
the
box
comes
with
small
instruction
manual,
which
makes
setting
up
and
pairing
to
my
iphone
or
computer
very
easily
the
sound
of
the
earbuds
are
great
only
need
couple
bars
before
it
gets
really
loud
it
also
comes
with
multiple
ear
pieces
but
the
ones
that
are
originally
on
fit
perfectly
such
easy
set
up,
great
value,
am
very
happy
with
this
and
would
recommend
it
to
anyone
looking
for
bluetooth
earbuds
for
such
great
price
on
my
second
pair
after
the
first
was
replaced
under
warranty
would
not
chargewhile
the
battery
is
great
and
audio
is
good,
do
not
recommend
these
for
anyone
that
sweats,
may
use
them
in
the
rain,
or
wears
hoodthe
controls
on
the
ear
piece
are
sensitive
to
moisture
and
the
moment
they
get
wet
your
audio
will
pause,
decrease
in
volume,
decrease
in
volume,
make

call,
or
start
sirii
just
finished
wearing
them
for
an
hour
and
stopped
my
workout
at
least
times
to
dry
them
and
pull
out
my
phone
to
fix
the
audioi

at
the

the

isn't
anything

blowing
get
about

that's
my
biggest
complaint
outside

i'm
new

and
can
be
technically

some
of
the

not

the

the

was
great
have
used
them
for
three
days
now
for
my
walks
and
held
the
charge
they
now
pair
automatically
with
my
phone
and
disconnect
when
out
of
ears
the
only
negative
is
that
they
did
not
work
great
for
phone
calls
but
i'm
using
for
exercising
and
music
great
product
and
would
recommend
for

just
wish
they

different
brands
and
types
can
be
overwhelming
these
headphones
are
actually
good,
first
the
charging
case
is
bonus,
not
having
to
worry
about
carrying
around
cable,
the
charge
status
lights
lets
you
know
how
much
charge
is
left
on
the
headset
and
case
sound
quality
is
good,
and
the
ability
to
control
the
headset
just
by
touching
the
ear
piece
is
key
one
thing
really
like
is
the
ability
to
use
it
as
single
piece
or
as
set,
it
sits
comfortably
in
my
ear,
even
while
working
out
all
in
all
believe
it
was
good
purchase,
especially
with
the
amount
of
similar
brands
out
there
bought
these
earbuds
back
in
june
of
since
then
have
been
through
sets
they
were
kind
enough
to
send
me
replacement
set
after
the
first
pair
crapped
out
they
were
solid
at
first
but
took
nose
dive
on
both
occasions,
the
second
pair
even
more
so
one
day
they
are
fine
and
then
the
next
not
what
mean
is
that
they
were
holding
charge
up
to
hours
then
dwindled
down
to
0/0
hours
over
week
the
case
needs
charging
every
day
and
half
after
not
needing
it
for
two
weeks
major
problems
herethere
are
other
issues
as
well
but
if
you
want
to
waste
money,
buy
these
disappointing
this
set
is
fantastic
great
fit,
good
sound
and
versatileyou
can
connect
either
one
singlely
or
wear
both
at
the
same
time
often
use
just
one
whole
at
work
and
can
swap
one
for
the
other
when
the
battery
gets
lowthe
case
holds
charge
for
several
days
weeks,
and
charges
the
earbuds
repeatedly
i've
charged
the
case
once
since
purchasing
itlove
them
was
kinda
disappointed
in
the
results
after
wearing
these
headphones
for
about
week
for
some
reason
one
of
the
headphone
after
every
use
just
seemed
like
it
was
getting
lower
and
hard
to
hear
out
off
than
after
while
the
other
one
started
to
do
the
same
no
they
weren
dirty
,
dropped,
or
washed
out,
they
just
started
to
lose
steam
guess
would
say
so
returned
them
it
crazy
cause
would
ve
recommended
them
at
first
but
after
they
started
doing
the
same
thing
wired
headphones
do
don
exactly
know
anymore
self
proclaimed
audiophile,
but
that
is
not
why
bought
these
bought
them
for
overall
convenience
however,
the
bang
for
your
buck
is
great
reasons
why
love
these
earbudsalong
with
few
downsides:
battery
life
is
unbelievable
the
charger
was
0%
on
arrival
and
haven
charged
since
the
shape
of
the
actual
speaker
fits
my
ear
well
audio
quality
is
good
the
set
comes
with
multitude
of
different
rubber
bud
options
for
different
size
ear
canals,
unfortunately
none
of
them
fit
mine
perfectly
they
don
fall
out
and
audio
is
still
good,
but
can
get
the
perfect
sealoverall,
very
satisfied
have
had
this
for
year
now
works
perfect
have
dropped
it
couple
of
times,
but
still
going
strong
the
charging
case
will
give
your
phone
decent
0%
charge,
but
then
you
compromise
on
the
battery
life
for
the
buds
itself
have
used
it
in
the
shower
couple
of
times,
works
fine
till
you
remove
it
after
ears
are
wet,
doesn't
stick,
but
that
is
fair
enough
has
good
battery
life,
am
not
big
into
bass
and
stuff,
just
need
to
listen
to
music
when
traveling/working
out
and
does
perfect
job
for
that
sounds
pretty
good
to
me
overall
great
product
for
the
price
and
would
0%
purchase

first
of
all,
customer
service
is
awesome
the
seller
really
wants
your
business
they
will
do
whatever
it
takes
to
ensure
that
you
are
satisfied
with
their
products
after
the
original
review
regarding
to
their
bluetooth
device,
they
sent
me
new
one,
and
even
offer
refund
which
declined
the
new
bluetooth
device
which
was
sent
to
me
works
perfectly
i'm
totally
satisfied
with
this
product
as
well
as
their
persistent
customer
serviceoriginal
review:good
for
listening
to
music
and
watching
movies
but
not
very
good
bluetooth
device
for
conversing
you
can
hear
it
very
clearly
but
you
pretty
much
have
to
shout
for
the
other
end
recipient
to
hear
bought
these
headphones
after
accidentally
leaving
mine
in
my
pocket
and
running
it
in
the
washing
machine
like
that
these
were
affordable
and
get
the
job
done
good
value
for
good
price
they
don
quiet
cancel
out
the
noise
as
well
as
other
brands
ve
had,
but
use
them
just
fine
on
my
morning
commute
and
at
the
gym
for
such
an
affordable
price,
it
worth
the
investment
most
products
claim
that
they
are
waterproof
and
end
up
not
living
up
to
the
consumers
expectations
this
product
is
actually
waterproof
the
sound
quality
and
noise
canceling
features
are
good
love
the
sleek
design
they
pair
quickly
to
my
iphone
and
stay
connected
will
be
purchasing
another
pair

someone
from
support
reaches
out
to
me
and
sent
replacement
set
so
far
so
good
with
the
replacement
it
has
been
few
weeks
and
no
issues
at
the
gym
the
other
set
had
would
fluctuate
in
volume
and
this
one
does
not
have
that
issue
hopefully
just
had

well
for
the
price
use

to

doing
chores
around
the
house
have
also
used
them
on

they
are

the
audio
was
clear
for
the

you
cannot
beat
thembattery
tends

within
about
hours
but
that
more
than
enough
for
most
situations
bought
lower
priced
one
from
different
manufacturer
and
had
to
return
this
one
is
easy
to
pair
&
setup
and
the
sound
is
great
it
comes
with
nice
charging
case
and
different
sized
ear
inserts
if
you
are
traveling
and
have
ear
piercing
young
kids
screaming
on
that
long
road
trip
than
these
are
the
earbuds
for
you
really
wanted
to
like
this
product
amazingly,
everything
was
worried
about
seemed
to
work
great
once
got
these
headphones
they're
pretty
easy
to
use,
they
fit
well,
and
thought
the
sound
quality
was
goodhowever,
discovered
that
once
you
walk
outside,
the
right
ear
piece
will
either
cut
out
completely
or
cut
in
and
out
sporadically
know
that
the
left
earbud
is
the
primary
piece,
so
my
theory
is
that
once
you're
outside
there
are
no
walls
for
the
signal
to
bounce
off
and
therefore
the
right
earbud
is
no
longer
able
to
receive
any
signal
from
the
leftthis
is
so
disappointing
because
if
any
of
the
other
issues
were
the
problem
here,
could
rate
this
as
or
star
product,
but
since
these
fail
to
work
just
as
headphones,
had
to
return
themif
you're
going
to
be
using
these
primarily
or
completely
indoors,
this
might
be
great
product
for
you
however,
they're
not
great
for
outdoor

which
is

the

disconnects

discovered
this
the
first
time
went
walking,
and
was
holding
my
phone
in
my
hand
when
swung
my
arms
and
so
moved
the

kept

when
just

it
sound

awesome
noise

is
what
you'd

i'd
say

my
wife
and
each
bought
pair
of
these
have
tried
several
other
headphones
but
these
worked
the
best
for
me
have
super
small
ears
and
most
headphones
hurt
after
mins
of
wearing
them
these
do
not
hurt
because
you
can
swap
the
tips
with
the
right
size
of
included
tips
sound
quality
was
decent
for
the
price
and
they
have
nice
features
such
as
tapping
them
to
pause
music
etconly
had
them
for
less
than
week
but
so
far
no
complaints
my
wife
loves
hers
too
hopefully
they
hold
up
well
was
little
dubious
at
first,
but
have
to
say,
these
earbuds
are
nice
they
can
definitely
handle
sweat,
and
they
don't
fall
out
of
your
ear,
which
was
what
really
concerned
me
since
they
aren't
attached
to
wire
they
fit
in
the
ear
very
well
have
hearing
aids,
but
they
both
fit
in
the
outer
part
of
my
ear
canals
the
sound
quality
is
great
it's
not
absolutely
perfect,
but
given
all
of
the
other
great
things
they
have
to
offer,
it
didn't
bother
me
one
bit
the
battery
life
is
exactly
what
they
say
it
is,
which
isn't
super
long
compared
to
other
earbuds
but
the
case
allows
them
to
recharge
quickly,
and
i'm
able
to
listen
to
music
and
podcasts
without
worrying
about
battery
life
at
all
i'm
so
glad
purchased
these
best
earbuds
i've
ever
owned
great
headphones
for
workout
it
really
stays
put
and
actually
it
comes
with
series
of
rubber
covers
just
in
case,
so
it's
not
one
size
fits
all
the
quality
of
sound
is
good
and
although
there's
no
buttons
on
the
earbuds
itself,
with
simple
tapping
can
perform
some
tasks
such
as
pause
the
only
downside
is
the
battery
life
it
only
last
for
about
0/0
hourseventually
must
put
them
back
in
the
box
to
charge
although
they
charge
fast
used
mostly
in
the
beach
so
far,
so
whenever
was
gone
for
swim
put
them
back
in
the
box
to
keep
the
battery
going
even
thou
this
was
the
unbranded
headset
but
the
bluetooth
was
nice
fit
in
the
ear
very
comfortably,
sound
was
blast
lot
of
bass
the
only
thing
think
it
need
it
need
to
improve
is
to
make
the
case
little
bit
smaller,
even
the
case
comes
it
with
has
like
0mah
power
bank
to
charge
your
phone
overall
this
is
good
product
and
hope
it
will
last
like
the
branded
bluetooth
headset
the
earbuds
came
with
everything
you
need
the
case
seems
durable
and
the
earbuds
themselves
fit
great
they
re
easy
to
run
with
and
don
fall
out
and
they
re
comfortable
they
seem
to
hold
decent
battery
life
so
far
paired
them
with
my
iphone
with
no
problem
all
the
descriptions
seem
on
point
with
what
this
comes
with
highly
recommend
if
you
wanna
watch
movies
or
listen
to
music
from
your
phone

review:
my
first
pair
didn't
work
as
it
should,
but
customer
service
did
everything
they
could
to
make
up
for
the
product
only
con
see
now
is
the
battery
life
isn't
long,
but
not
huge
problem
since
they
charge
pretty
fast
when
plugged
back
into
the
battery
pack
wanted
completely
wireless
earbuds
with
great
sound
and
great
battery
life
and
these
earbuds
are
exactly
that
they're
also
waterproof
which
is
great
because
can
listen
to
music
in
the
shower
without
disturbing
anyone
the
only
and
very
minor
problem
is
that
the
buttons
are
extremely
sensitive
to
touch
so
they
can
pause
if
the
water
hits
the
earbud
directly
otherwise
am
very
satisfied
with
these
am
very
impressed
with
these
ear
buds
bought
these,
to
listen
to
podcasts
while
working
and
not
have
to
worry
about
wires
getting
in
my
waythese
have
very
crisp
sound,
and
the
bluetooth
stays
connected
up
to
0ft
away
from
my
phone
which
is
great
considering
my
phone
is
always
in
pocketi
also
never
thought
about
these
being
headset
when
bought
them,
but
got
phone
call
today
and
went
to
turn
off
my
podcast
by
pressing
the
button
on
the
earbud
and
ended
up
answering
the
call
by
accident
and
was
able
to
perfectly
normal
conversation
with
my
phone
in
my
pocketi
am
very
happy
with
the
quality
of
this
product
and
the
price
is
great
the
earbuds
are
out
of
sync
bit
that
makes
the
sound
come
like
an
echo
of
sorts
and
gave
me
headachethe
touch
sensors
for
the
control
were
easy
to
figure
out
but
sometimes
they
wouldn't
take
the
anticipated
action
like
pausing
song
or
moving
to
the
next
song
while
trying
to
pause
song,
they
will
interpret
the
action
as
trying
to
redial
the
last
call
on
the
phone
the
sound
quality
was
great
they
connected
easily
to
my
phone
even
used
in
the
rain
with
no
issues
the
fit
was
perfect
with
the
rubber
ear
pieces
on
it
but
appreciated
that
there
were
several
other
sizes
included
as
occasionally
by
children
borrow
my
headphones
the
charging
is
convenient
since
you
can
charge
the
case
to
take
with
you
to
charge
the
headphonesoverall
the
product
far
exceeded
my
expectations,
especially
for
the
price
have
enjoyed
these
ear
buds
for
over
month
now
use
them
every
day
for
about
an
hour
and
didn't
charge
the
case
for
over
month
do
have
the
issue
others
have
written
about
with
the
left
bud
cutting
in
and
out
but
it's
not
daily
occurrence
and
for
the
price,
will
deal
with
it
the
sound
on
these
is
fine
for
my
purpose
and
don't
have
anything
negative
to
say
highly
recommend
them
absolutely
love
these
earphones
got
pair
for
my
husband
for
christmas
and
he
uses
them
0/0,
so
wanted
pair
for
myself
since
they
were
such
huge
hit
use
them
when
cleaning
around
the
house
and
when
walking
my
kiddos
to
school
when
have
the
stroller
sound
quality
is
great
and
they
fit
comfortably
after
messing
around
with
the
ear
piece
sizes
for
minute
haven
tried
them
in
the
shower
yet,
but
they
have
survived
two
splashing
toddlers
during
bath
time
wear
one
piece
in
case
call
comes
in
and
my
hands
are
too
wet
or
soapy
to
answer
the
phone
definitely
recommend
the
first
pair
bought
had
problem
that
when
you
speak
on
phone
the
opposite
person
couldnt
hear
however
they
changed
the
ear
buds
saying
that
they
updated
their
product
but
the
new
one
also
had
the
same
problem
now
am
just
using
to
listen
to
music
pretty
expensive
do
not
buy
absolutely
love
that
can
use
one
earbud
at
time
case
charges
the
earbud
like
that
it
unnoticeable
it
is
great
for
work
and
am
receptionist
the
case
charges
for
so
long
that
it
catches
me
off
guard
when
it
needs
charging
great
set
of
earbuds
if
you
don't
want
to
pay
for
the
name
brand
competition
have
pair
of
galaxy
buds
that
purchased
after
buying
these
and
have
to
say
that
the
sound
quality
is
on
par
with
my
galaxy
buds
the
only
reason
ended
up
buying
the
galaxy
buds
was
because
got
really
good
deal
from
friend
and
also
didn't
like
the
fact
that
you
couldn't
choose
which
earbud
you
wanted
to
use
separately
like
you
can
with
the
galaxy
buds
if
the
company
that
makes
these
could
implement
that
on
these
earbuds
they
would
give
samsung
some
serious
competition
have
tried
few
other
earbuds
so
far
and
this
is
the
best
among
everything
else
that
have
ever
purchased
could
see
much
better
quality
in
mic
comparatively
didn
see
issues
with
ear
speakers
at
all
in
any
of
the
products
that
used
so
far
but
noticed
the
mic
will
have
less
receipting
quality
in
some
of
them
but
this
one
is
very
good
battery
life
is
good
and
it
comes
with
great
charging
case
with
nice
led
indicators
it
easy
to
pair
and
both
channels
are
syncing
nicely
and
quickly
have
had
those
earbuds
for
week
and
love
them
so
far
so
good
the
most
important
for
me
was
the
fit
in
the
ear
and
to
wear
something
that
did
not
bother
my
sensible
ears
run
and
having
snug
fit
is
important
all
of
that
was
achieved
while
maintaining
very
good
sound
quality
can't
praise
the
product
enoughi
have
also
received
prompt
customer
support
via
email
when
initially
had
set
up
questions
that
raises
my
level
of
comfort
significantly
looking
forward
to
use
it
for
long
time
after
buying
these
earbuds,
must
say,
have
been
one
of
the
best
purchases
have
ever
made
on
amazon
fit
effortlessly
and
comfortably
in
both
my
ears,
the
design
and
feel
of
these
are
not
cheap
at
all0
each
bud
last
about
hours0
can
use
together
or
individually
which
was
exactly
what
wanted
to
make
sure
was
the
case
instantly
connects
to
phone
via
bluetooth
after
you
pair
each
earbud
left
&
right
respectively0
the
power
bank
case
has
been
the
biggest
surprise
since
any
bank
have
ever
owned
has
never
lived
up
to
its
manufacturers
claims
have
only
charged
the
case
once
since
got
it
as
it
still
has
over
half
its
juice
left
after
many
times
of
switching
and
charging
each
earbud
about
times
per
shift
which
is
better
than
expected
these
earbuds
surprised
me
superb
sound
quality,
long
battery
life,
easy
to
use
and
comfortable
to
wear
can
say
enough
good
things
about
them
my
husband
even
informed
me
that
there
is
no
background
noise
heard
when
utilizing
these
earbuds
on
phone
call
highly
recommend
you
give
these
try
my
husband
even
informed
me
that
there
is
no
background
noise
heard
when
utilizing
these
earbuds
on
phone
call
highly
recommend
you
give
these
try
just
got
them
today
received
them
early
really
love
the
case
it
comes
in
it
magnetic
which
is
nice
feature
the
charger
looks
like
an
android
charger,
it
comes
with
extra
soft
pear
pieces
for
the
buds
plus
there
also,
they
came
with
pouch
for
the
case
haven
had
chance
to
use
them
yet
but
so
far
as
esthetics
goes
liking
them
so
far
when
they
worked
the
sound
was
just
ok
they
broke
after
months
piece
fell
out
of
the
left
earbud
and
made
them
unusable
the
left
ear
was
way
too
loud
tried
to
return
them
because
they
should
have
year
warranty
but
had
issues
with
that
beware
these
are
great
they
come
charged
used
them
almost
nonstop
for
days
before
had
to
charge
the
box
the
sound
quality
is
superb
and
if
had
them
up
loader
the
noise
cancellation
is
great
well
worth
the
cost
will
be
purchasing
as
gifts
for
teenagers
this
christmas
bought
these
headphones
back
in
january
they
lasted
up
till
about
week
ago
used
them
everywhere,
to
work,
to
the
gym,
in
school,
everywhere
they
sound
is
fairly
good
if
you
just
want
to
listen
to
music
while
you
do
other
stuff
the
headphones
last
around
hours
without
charge
overall
amazingtip
for
anyone
trying
to
use
the
warranty,
do
not
bother
spent
the
last
0hrs
or
so
calling
people/messaging
support/making
claim
at
this
point
just
consider
it
loss
and
will
buy
it
againamazing
headphones,
bad
protection
service
was
skeptical
about
using
wireless
earbuds
because
sometimes
regular
buds
with
cords
don't
fit
well
enough
to
begin
with
and
fall
out
these
stay
in
there
are
several
different
sizes
of
attachments
to
change
to
for
sizing
help
if
neededthe
sound
quality
is
great
used
these
while
on
motorcycle
ride
and
could
listen
to
what
wanted
and
my
husband
could
listen
to
something
else
on
his
stereo
no
problems
with
amount
of
volume
sound
adjustments,
such
as
bass
and
trebile
can
be
made
thru
your
phone
or
other
connectable
devicethe
directions
are
understandable
but
it's
obvious
that
they
are
not
translated
well
regarding
grammar
but
the
needed
info
is
still
there
was
highly
disappointed
with
the
sound
quality
of
these
earbuds,
no
bottom
end
,bass,
whether
wearing
one
or
both
buds,
while
on
phone
call
had
to
tell
to
be
heard
nor
could
hear
the
other
party
unless
was
inside
in
quiet
room,
but
poor
sound
quality
purchase
was
made
to
utilize
while
on
long
flight
to
watch
movies
and
video
calls
i'm
afraid
to
test
the
water
resistance
at
least
can
listen/talk
while
in
quiet
room
the
sound
was
great
when
turned
it
on
am
very
familiar
with
these
things
and
actually
have
similar
product
mine
keeps
cutting
in
and
out
with
my
phone
right
in
front
of
me
maybe
got
defective
product
but
hope
these
issues
can
be
fixed
because
always
thought
this
was
an
awesome
product
till
my
wife
gifted
me
one
this
weekend
for
my
birthday
these
really
did
work
great
for
about
two
months
used
them
at
my
desk
days
week
fairly
consistently
with
absolutely
no
problems
until
last
week,
when
was
suspicious
that
the
volume
was
getting
lower
thought
was
just
imagining
it
at
first,
until
yesterday
when
realized
the
volume
had
gotten
so
low
that
even
with
my
computer's
volume
at
0%,
it
was
still
noticeably
quiet
especially
for
product
that's
plugged
directly
into
my
earthe
volume
control
on
the
earbuds
doesn't
work,
so
there's
no
fixing
this
product
save
yourself
the
cash
and
don't
get
burned,
look
elsewhere
after
long
consideration,
because
barely
used
any
new
headphone
brand
besides
sony
and
bose
i'm
also
so
picky
and
usually
spend
good
amount
of
money
for
hitech
devices
by
friend
advice,
decided
to
take
try
for
this
earbud
and
it
was
really
good
with
reasonable
pricesound
quality:
acceptable,
as
mentioned
used
alot
of
expensive
sony
and
bose
headphones
for
me,
this
earbud's
sound
quality
is
acceptable
for
workout
battery
life:
really
good
plus
point
with
0mah,
can
you
more
than
days
the
sound
quality
is
excellent
use
them
everyday
at
work
when
listening
to
my
podcasts
they're
very
comfortable
and
cancel
out
background
noise
well
i'm
pleasantly
surprised
at
how
long
they
stay
charged
only
have
to
charge
the
case
they
come
in
every
few
weeks
and
thats
with
heavy
usage
ive
been
shopping
around
for
some
good
wireless
headphones
and
even
bought
few
and
they
honestly
all
sucked
finally
broke
down
on
these
pair
mainly
because
they
were
waterproof
and
had
some
awesome
reviews,
so
it
was
my
last
effort
for
wireless
headphones
got
them
fairly
quickly
and
everything
was
beautifully
packaged
and
the
first
thing
did
was
stick
those
suckers
in
my
ears
because
thats
been
my
struggle
with
other
brands
is
how
they
would
always
fall
out
of
my
ears
but
these
headphones
not
only
fit
perfect
but
they
sound
great
and
don't
even
feel
that
their
there,
am
super
satisfied
with
this
product
and
will
wear
them
proudly
everyday
the
sound
quality
is
excellent
these
were
not
made
for
smaller
ears
they
were
uncomfortable
even
with
the
smaller
ear
tips
the
left
earbud
is
the
only
one
that
can
be
used
by
itself
if
you
are
wanting
earbuds
that
you
can
use
one
while
charging
the
other,
this
is
not
for
you
it
did
seem
to
be
very
well
constructed
if
you
have
larger
ears
and
dont
mind
only
using
the
left
earbud
alone,
they
are
great
0st
thing
that
i'm
going
to
say
is
make
sure
that
you
remove
the
plastic
off
the
ear
buds
so
they
can
charge/pair
properly
once
you
do
this
just
follow
the
instructions
to
pair
it
with
your
device
so
off
the
bat
have
to
say
that
i've
never
had
great
luck
with
earbuds
staying
in
these
ones
fit
awesome
as
far
as
the
sound
goes
there
are
crystal
clear
and
the
base
is
decent
as
well
as
far
as
the
battery
life
goes
it
seems
pretty
good
because
haven't
had
to
charge
them
and
it's
been
few
days
definitely
would
recommend
as
purchase
the
sound
quality
is
pretty
good,
but
one
of
the
headphones
already
has
bit
of
shortage
the
right
now
does
not
play
as
loud
as
the
left
also
the
battery
life
isn't
great
missed
the
deadline
to
return
them
&
thought
that
could
bare
with
having
to
charge
them,
but
after
the
second
issueughh
figured
need
to
at
least
write
review
about
what
i'm
experiencing
it's
not
the
best
buy
in
my
opinion
i'm
just
going
to
listen
one
ear
at
time
around
the
house
got
these
as
present
for
my
partner
he's
been
working
out
more
and
the
wire
from
regular
headphones
has
been
really
getting
in
the
way
for
him
he
said
these
stay
put
well
even
during
high
intensity
workouts
he
did
have
to
get
the
fit
rightthe
charge
least
for
good
amount
of
time
and
being
able
to
charge
phone
with
the
earbud
case
is
an
awesome
featurequality
of
sound
is
really
good
the
first
set
were
flaud
and
were
retuned
the
company
immediately
sent
me
replacement
the
second
work
greatyou
would
have
tough
time
find
this
quality
at
this
pricethey
are
everything
wanted
the
company
stands
behind
it
so
buy
onebet
you
will
not
return
it
after
researching
for
bluetooth
earbuds,
found
this
to
be
the
best
out
of
alli've
also
owned
enactfire
and
some
other
products,
but
comparatively
these
earbuds
are
betterthe
battery
life
is
good,
and
this
0mah
battery
charging
case
is
very
usefulit
has
the
bass
and
clear
music
sound
as
well
highly
recommend
for
listening
to
music
while
working
out
in
the
gym,
if
you're
like
menoise
cancellation
changed
to
another
type
of
earbuds,
and
now
can
hardly
hear
the
environment
noise
once
after
put
these
earbuds
ondesign
very
well
designed,
fits
my
ear
even
though
have
small
ear
these
little
suckers
work
pretty
well
considering
the
priceit
comes
with
additional
ear
pieces
so
finding
one
that'll
fit
your
ear
is
easy
sound
is
as
good
as
can
expect,
bass
response
could
be
better
but
i'm
just
nit
pickingpairing
it
to
my
phone
was
easy,
instructions
that
came
with
the
headphones
were
simple
as
can
beoverall
recommended
work
in
at
job
where
data
collection
and
entry
is
standard,
so
things
become
little
mundane
these
blue
tooth
headphones
have
made
my
job
easier
and
little
more
bearable
really
like
that
you
can
use
one
ear
phone
at
time,
sometimes
coworker
or
my
boss
needs
my
attention,
so
being
aware
of
that
is
helpful
these
headphones
are
worth
it
if
you
want
to
enjoy
simple
audio
while
doing
everyday
tasks
connect
to
my
phone,
and
laptop
personally
to
play
podcasts
and
background
music
while
work
few
years
ago
something
like
this
would
cost
well
over
$0,
so
you
can
imagine
my
surprise
to
find
something
of
higher
quality
at
half
the
price
very
simply,
they
work
great
connect
without
issue,
the
battery
is
very
good
use
them
for
hours
at
pop
and
have
yet
to
have
them
lose
battery
power,
the
charge
case
lasts
weeks
for
me
haven't,
had
chance
to
check
how
water
proof
they
actually
are
yet
sound
quality
is
good
for
me
as
am
not
an
audiophile
by
any
meanstap
controls
work
as
advertised
just
solid
all
around,
very
pleased
ve
had
these
headphones
for
about
months
and
ve
had
pretty
consistent
issues
they
re
now
starting
to
completely
die;
can
no
longer
use
the
right
headphone
at
all
the
best
part
is
that
there
apparently
are
no
electronic
copies
of
the
user
manual
anywhere
on
the
internet
the
one
found
is
incomplete
and
inaccurate
so
can
even
try
to
troubleshoot
as
definitely
didn
keep
the
tiny
piece
of
paper
they
came
with
for
this
long
also
really
hate
how
easy
it
is
to
accidentally
turn
on
voice
controls
because
there
is
no
actual
button
on
the
headphones,
it
just
an
area
that
you
tap
and
it
almost
impossible
to
avoid
tapping
if
you
have
to
take
headphone
off
for
any
reason
ve
accidentally
called
people
haven
spoken
to
in
years
because
of
this
issue
and
it
infuriating
have
to
take
them
off
and
reconnect
so
often
that
rather
just
deal
with
wires
have
been
wanting
different
way
to
listen
to
music
because
have
not
been
to
happy
with
the
other
devices
have
used
until
now
when
opened
the
box
was
so
excited
to
see
the
quality
is
amazing
the
charging
holder
comes
with
bag
too
so
my
case
will
not
get
dirty
and
easier
to
find
in
my
gym
bag
and
pursethey
fit
well
and
did
not
have
any
ear
pain
which
have
in
the
past
with
other
ear
plugsthe
sound
is
great,
they
are
light
weight
and
easy
to
know
they
are
charged
by
the
lights
on
them
it
is
also
easy
to
hook
up
and
sync
with
your
bluetoothi
am
happy
girl
now
that
have
my
adorable
case,
great
earbuds
that
are
easy
and
fun
to
use
the
headphones
are
great
for
the
price
the
noise
cancellation
isn't
the
best,
recommend
taking
out
the
inside
filter
for
louder
sound
some
of
the
controls
can
be
very
complicated,
but
it
has
ton
of
bass
and
the
battery
life
can
be
max
three
hours
they
can
be
used
individually
have
had
few
problems
with
them,
but
that's
to
be
expected
with
0$
headphones
the
case
doesn't
really
charge
phones,
the
battery
isn't
big
enough
everything
about
these
earbuds
is
pretty
good
they
easily
connect,
the
magnetic
case
is
very
useful,
and
the
sound
quality
is
great
the
problem
is
the
battery
life
going
from
full
charge
within
an
hour
it
is
already
dead
so
these
are
not
very
helpful
for
long
flights
or
anything
that
will
extend
beyond
one
hour
had
to
write
review
got
these
months
ago
they
are
good/ok
they
do
not
noise
cancel
and
they
could
be
little
louder
but
the
reason
gave
it
five
stars
is
last
night
accidentally
washed
them
they
did
full
cycle
when
got
them
out
they
were
beeping
and
just
knew
they
were
dead
this
has
happened
with
pair
of
more
expensive
headphones
in
with
lot
less
water
and
they
never
cut
on
again
put
them
back
in
the
case
let
them
charge
overnight
just
to
see
if
they
will
work
again
well
am
using
them
right
now,
no
problems
wonderful
product
thank
you
these
are
fantastic
even
better
than
taking
straight
through
my
phone
fit
nice
and
snug
however
not
too
snug
you
can
use
one
or
both
together
and
they
charge
quickly
my
only,
and
do
mean
only,
complaint
is
that
the
right
ear
cuts
out
from
time
to
time
if
that
weren't
an
issue
stars
all
day
long
right
earbud
doesnt
work
more
than
half
the
time,
issues
connecting,
randomly
disconnecting
when
it
does
work
they
are
very
uncomfortable,
there
is
no
bass
and
the
quality
is
what
expect
from
$0
earbuds
i'm
not
sure
how
these
get
any
good
reviews
wasn't
expecting
much
from
these,
just
to
work
properly
and
sound
better
these
bluetooth
wireless
earbuds
are
must
have
love
how
the
case
is
also
extra
power
bank
for
my
phone
and
earbuds
on
the
go
my
phone
has
tendency
to
have
low
battery
was
very
impress
with
noice
cancelling
allows
me
to
focus
on
my
music
or
conversation
without
disturbance
but
last
but
not
least
my
favorite
feature
is
these
earbuds
are
water
resistant
my
family
was
complaining
about
my
music
when
shower
in
the
morning
these
earbuds
was
the
solution
no
long
have
to
worry
about
waking
up
the
whole
house
when
i'm
showering
while
listening
to
music
and
talking
on
the
phone
in
the
morning
am
very
pleased
with
my
purchase
considering
getting
friend
part
as
gift
love
these
they
stay
in
my
ears
really
really
good
even
when
sweating
at
the
gym
which
is
why
got
them
and
because
of
the
reviews
on
here
when
they
say
try
the
diffrent
extra
ear
pieces
that
come
with
the
package
do
it
because
you
have
to
find
the
right
fit
and
also
when
first
tried
them
didnt
hear
the
stero
sound
but
changed
the
ear
piece
and
it
made
huge
diffrence
one
thing
forgot
to
mention
they
are
so
snug
that
it
does
not
fall
out
or
feel
like
it's
going
to
fall
out
or
hurt
your
ear
like
some
do
highly
recommend
and
also
you
cant
beat
that
price
these
wireless
earpods
came
already
fully
charged
they
were
very
easy
to
pair
with
my
iphone
max
there
are
many
different
size
ear
inserts
to
accommodate
ear
sizes
listen
to
lots
of
audio
books
and
used
them
for
hours
straight
out
of
the
box
and
they
were
still
fully
charged
lovely
sound
quality
and
comfortable
fit
was
worried
about
the
record
on
these
but
thought
would
still
give
it
try
they
turned
out
to
be
great
and
perfect
for
working
out
use
them
at
the
gym
and
they
stay
in
without
any
issues
do
wish
that
they
would
move
through
songs
and
be
bit
smaller,
but
other
than
that,
they
are
wonderful
my
son
has
been
wanting
wireless
headphones
for
while,
but
couldn't
justify
the
high
cost
found
these
and
decided
to
try
them
since
they
were
about
quarter
of
the
cost
he
loves
how
easy
they
are
to
charge
in
their
own
carrying
case
they
are
super
simple
to
pair
with
his
devices,
and
the
quality
of
sound
is
lot
better
than
what
had
anticipated
the
charge
lasts
decent
amount
of
time
low
quality
sound
no
bass
to
be
found
the
noise
cancelling
wasn't
very
good
was
hoping
to
pick
these
up
as
cheap
replacement
to
the
samsung
earbuds
ended
up
giving
these
to
my
son
and
just
got
the
samsung
earbuds
instead
difficulty
with
pairing
each
headphone
at
first
unpacking
these
earbuds
are
packaged
very
well,
and
they
are
all
inclusive
of
everything
that
you
need
for
good
fit
they
come
with
several
different
size
ear
pieces
so
you
can
find
the
correct
fit,
and
it
comes
with
carrying
bag
which
is
plus
the
case
itself
seems
well
built
the
earbuds
fit
into
the
charging
ports
perfectly
blue
tooth
was
easy
to
set
up
and
the
individual
buds
paired
with
each
other
automatically
as
soon
as
there
removed
from
case
they
fit
in
your
ear
great
after
selecting
the
correct
size
bud
from
the
included
pieces
the
sound
quality
is
good
so
was
looking
for
an
alternative
and
affordable
option
to
spending
all
that
money
to
get
some
apple
airpods
and
came
across
this
great
and
value
priced
alternative
with
the
pasonomi
ear
buds
on
top
of
this
the
sound
quality
is
excellent,
the
pairing
is
breeze
and
it
has
this
great
charging
case
actually
doubles
as
mah
power
bank,
which
means
you
can
either
recharge
the
earbuds
times,
or
use
it
to
power
up
your
smartphone
since
use
my
ear
buds
outside
when
bike
the
ipx0
waterresistance
and
nanocoating
make
it
great
for
use
in
the
outdoors
or
at
the
gym
this
is
great
affordable
and
high
quality
option
to
the
apple
airpods
really
enjoy
these
headphones
they
are
comfortable,
the
battery
lasts
long
time
and
the
sound
quality
is
great
very
happy
with
them
stuck
using
broken
earbuds
one
will
pair
and
the
other
will
pair
and
it
will
say
connected
at
the
same
time
but
only
one
bud
will
play
and
when
tap
the
one
that
isn
it
switches
to
that
one
instead
of
syncing
all
because
my
brother
just
tried
using
them
too
joined
with
it
and
him
no
one
else
two
people
and
it
broke
useless
man
want
my
money
back
:
haven't
used
any
other
bluetooth
headset
since
getting
this
one
overall
like
the
design
and
fit
it
comes
with
variety
of
sizes,
and
is
comfortable
to
use
when
running/working
out
one
caution
is
that
when
you're
charging,
make
sure
you
see
the
red
light
otherwise
sometimes
it
may
look
like
its
charging
when
its
not
the
sound
quality
is
not
thsy
great
in
terms
of
bass
even
with
playing
bass
boosted
song
you
arely
hear
any
however
they
fit
amazingly
well,
the
fact
the
case
doubles
as
charger
is
plus
as
well
not
to
mention
the
ipx0
helps
if
you
ever
drop
them
in
waterhopefully
you're
not
planning
to
do
thatyou
can
use
them
separately,
however
do
to
their
design
they
wont
fit
in
the
opposite
ear
that
well
if
not
at
all
i've
been
searching
and
searching
for
wireless
earbuds
at
an
affordable
price
and
finally
took
the
plunge
with
this
pair
the
price
was
reasonable
and
it
turned
out
to
be
very
good
product
sounds
quality
is
great,
pausing,
pairing,
recharging
all
very
intuitive
i'm
really
pleased
with
this
product
and
definitely
share
my
happiness
with
my
friends
and
family
tried
couple
of
wireless
earbuds,
and
this
one
fulfills
just
the
need
for
me
for
reasonable
price
since
am
not
person
of
enjoying
ultra
high
sound
qualities
though
touchlike
buttons
for
playback
and
calls
were
unexpected,
soon
liked
it
battery
life
is
also
reasonable
that
they
seem
to
be
going
for
around
the
length
of
time
they
promise
it
also
instantly
connects
with
my
mobile
device
it
definitely
seems
good
fit
for
listening
to
normal
music
haven't
tested
this
while
am
running
but
think
it
would
be
also
okay
since
it
fits
very
well
to
my
ears
am
more
than
satisfied
with
this
so
far
ordered
this
product
because
my
husband
researched
online
and
saw
the
best
reviews
and
the
price
for
these
earbuds
were
not
expensive,
but
of
great
value
and
quality
once
used
his
earbuds
after
they
were
ordered,
and
tested
the
sound
using
cellphone,
smartwatch,
and
portable
bluetooth
radio,
and
found
the
audio
and
media
sound
to
be
just
what
wanted,
purchased
pair
also
the
charge
holds
great
and
we
were
able
to
wear
these
while
working
out
on
treadmill,
cooking,
walking,
or
just
about
anything
they
are
lightweight
but
give
hefty
sound
would
recommend
purchase
horrible
broke
on
the
first
day
and
wouldn
reconnect
to
one
another
got
this
for
my
son
as
birthday
gift
and
couldn
get
in
touch
with
anyone
to
return
them
after
several
emails
buy
name
brand
and
skip
the
hassle
great
affordable
alternative
to
air
pods
or
other
name
brand
wireless
headphone
products
using
the
case
to
charge
other
usb
powered
devices
is
great
bonus
featurei
used
these
to
do
yard
work
for
few
hours
on
the
first
day
of
use
without
issue
where
apple
earbuds
give
me
ear
fatigue
after
half
an
hour
or
so,
these
remained
comfortable
was
looking
for
truly
wireless
headphones
and
like
these
lot
love
that
the
carrying
case
also
charges
them
as
soon
as
you
pop
the
headphones
back
in
also
like
the
features
of
being
able
to
tap
the
headphones
to
pause/play/skip
and
to
pull
up
google
assistant/siri
my
only
complaints
are
that
the
sound
can
be
iffy,
loud
at
times
then
quiet
then
loud
again
also,
they
will
randomly
pair
with
my
phone
even
though
they
are
supposed
to
be
off/disconnected
which
is
annoying
had
concern
when
receiving
the
product
because
the
right
earbud
would
not
connect
with
the
left
would
give
this
product
stars
if
the
manufacturer
didn't
help
me
resolve
my
issue
but
they
responded
to
my
email
with
troubleshooting
tips
and
the
right
earbud
now
works
just
fine
you
can
tell
that
they're
not
based
in
america
or
britain
just
by
reading
their
emails
alone
so
appreciate
the
effort
to
responding
to
customers
that
speak
english
the
earbuds
aren't
very
bass
heavy
but
i'm
not
disturbed
because
got
them
for
only
$0
that's
too
cheap
to
be
complaining
about
anything,
really
might
edit
this
after
few
months
of
use
am
giving
these
earbuds
one
star
because
after
my
fourth
day
of
using
them
for
only
an
hour
at
time,
the
right
earbud
was
so
quiet
couldn't
hear
anything
tried
to
clean
it
out
even
though
they
were
too
new
to
even
have
ear
wax
or
dirt
built
up
yet,
listened
in
the
other
ear,
changed
the
audio
settings
on
my
phone,
and
nothing
worked
it
was
clear
it
was
the
earbud
itself
they
were
never
wet,
dropped,
or
damaged
in
any
way
customer
service
refused
to
replace
it,
so
returned
them
right
away
what's
worse
also
tried
to
charge
my
phone
using
the
earbud
case
and
it
was
only
able
to
charge
it
an
additional
0%
before
going
dead
and
the
case
was
fully
charged
to
begin
with
don't
waste
your
money
on
this
product
they
are
comfortable
and
work
great
definitely
great
value
for
the
money
occasionally
have
trouble
with
them
pairing
to
my
phone,
but
am
not
sure
if
it
is
the
headphones
or
my
phone
that
is
causing
the
problem
for
$0,
these
had
the
equivalent
sound
to
$0
budget
earbuds
the
clarity
was
fairly
decent,
but
the
bass
was
almost
nonexistent
volume
could
definitely
have
been
louder,
tested
up
to
full
volume
with
the
help
of
an
equalizer
app,
yet
this
was
still
unsatisfactory
for
my
personal
preference
in
all
honesty,
these
offbrand
headphones
are
hit
or
miss,
more
often
than
not
miss
only
tested
these
for
half
an
hour,
but
that's
all
it
took
to
make
me
realize
that
today
was
miss
returned
these
earbuds
the
same
day
that
they
arrived0star
for
material
because
the
design
was
nice,
material
seemed
legit
nice
magnetic
charging
case
build
little
bit
bulky,
could
get
uncomfortable
after
extended
use0star
for
quality
see
below0star
for
battery
life
because
both
earbuds
came
fully
charged,
but
did
not
have
them
for
long
enough
to
test
their
battery
life
and
charging
case
capacity
with
respect
to
the
product
description
mediocre
at
best
battery
only
lasts
0/0
hours
because
they're
so
quiet,
they
have
to
be
used
at
full
volume
bass
is
nearly
nonexistent
plus
they
do
poor
job
of
pairing
bluetooth
if
they
don't
connect
right
away,
you
have
to
turn
them
off
and
try
again
which
is
chore
because
they
don't
have
an
off
button
you
have
to
put
them
back
in
the
charger
and
wait
for
them
to
turn
themselves
off
the
only
things
like
about
it
are
that
they
didn't
cost
lot
of
money
live
and
learn
and
that
you
can
use
the
charging
base
to
charge
other
usb
devices
like
these,
only
couple
complaints
have
are
is
the
bud
itself
is
on
the
larger
size
so
if
you
have
small
ears
like
my
husband
you
may
find
it
hard
to
have
them
stay
also
you
can
use
the
right
side
alone
only
the
leftupdateso
initially
put
stars,
but
after
having
them
about
months
or
so
my
review
has
changed,
the
left
ear
bud
has
significantly
lower
volume
than
the
right
they
sometimes
crackle
also
by
no
means
techie
/expert
in
the
department
of
any
type
of
technology
mom
of
an
and
year
old
who
know
how
to
operate
any
electronic
device
in
our
house
better
than
‍♀
look
for
ease
of
setup;
operation;
quality
and
competitive
price
point
for
what
you
re
paying
for
these
wireless
blue
tooth
ear
buds
are
all
of
the
above
for
very
reasonable
price
it
took
me
few
minutes
to
pair
and
set
up
right
out
of
the
box
instructions
are
very
straight
forward
in
my
opinion
excellent
sound
quality
sleek
design
relatively
petite
and
have
always
had
difficulty
getting
any
type
of
ear
bud
to
fit
comfortably
the
design
and
numerous
size
options
work
perfectly
for
me
now
to
hide
from
tweens
who
are
already
eyeing
my
new
purchase
have
use
this
on
daily
base,
and
within
months,
the
main
frame
wont
charged
at
first,
thought
it
was
my
charger,
so
try
different
one,
still
no
luck
eventually
the
buds
die
off
because
can't
charged
the
main
frame
the
buds
life
time
is
around
hours
of
used
in
oder
for
you
to
reversed/skipped
music,
you
have
to
use
both
earbuds,
otherwise
you
can
only
do
one
thing
if
use
single
bud
left
reversed,
right
skipped
same
thing
with
volume
this
is
really
annoying,
and
you
have
to
linkbluetooth
both
buds
give
stars
because
the
sound
quality
was
amazing,
but
now
it's
garbage
because
used
have
really
small
ear
holes
and
have
tried
lot
of
different
ear
buds
all
of
them
either
dont
fit
or
constantly
fall
out
of
my
ears
when
i'm
doing
any
activity
these
are
awesome
they
fit
comfortably
and
have
not
had
any
problems
with
them
falling
out
the
sound
is
also
very
impressive,
can
actually
hear
the
base
noise
cancellation
is
very
nice
my
job
can
be
very
noisy
at
times
and
these
block
out
all
sounds
can't
believe
the
price
for
such
nice
earbuds
would
definitely
suggest
anyone
to
buy
these
this
is
my
first
pair
of
bluetooth
earbuds
and
was
not
disappointed
love
that
the
case
holds
charge
and
the
earbuds
can
just
be
placed
back
in
the
case
to
be
charged
also
they
came
with
several
extra
sizes
of
covers
for
different
size
ears
it
also
comes
with
little
storage
pouch
to
put
the
case
into
when
it
is
not
being
used
the
sound
quality
was
fabulous
also
love
that
you
are
able
to
control
your
music
and
answer
phone
calls
just
by
tapping
one
of
the
buds
the
instructions
were
easy
to
understand;
was
able
to
pair
the
earbuds
together
and
to
my
phone
the
first
try
highly
recommend
these
earbuds
you
won't
be
disappointed
like
this
earbuds
very
much,
because
it
is
very
convenient
to
connect
the
devices
and
it
is
totally
wireless
feel
very
comfortable
to
wear
this
earbuds
like
to
listen
music
when
do
the
exercise
there
is
cord
anymore
can
go
to
the
rest
room
without
bring
my
phone
and
still
receive
the
music
the
quality
of
the
sound
is
also
good
comparing
to
its
price
bought
these
for
use
at
the
gym
the
first
thing
to
know
is
that
they
only
lasted
about
year
before
the
terminals
on
the
case
and
the
earbuds
started
to
fail
at
first,
they
struggled
to
reconnect
to
the
charging
case
making
them
difficult
to
charge
then
recently,
of
the
earbuds
wouldn't
connect
to
the
charging
case
at
all
rendering
them
useless
they
lasted
year
disappointing
purchase
for
product
that
could
have
rated
higher
if
they
had
some
durability
also,
pamper
my
electronicsso
these
were
highly
cared
for
items
wish
something
could
be
done
was
skeptical
at
first
because
apple
airpods
dominate
the
market,
but
these
headphones
are
seriously
amazing
super
simple
to
setup,
literally
open
the
package
and
put
the
earphones
in
and
they
connect
without
any
problem
the
features
on
each
piece
are
extremely
helpful
and
intuitive
and
most
importantly
the
sound
quality
is
shocking
for
something
this
small
and
portable
added
feature
of
the
phone
charging
is
also
why
got
these
instead
of
something
else
would
highly
recommend
this
to
anybody
these
headphones
are
must
have
for
those
looking
for
quality
with
out
paying
an
exorbitant
price
i'm
very
pleased
with
the
convenience
these
offer
i'm
busy
mom
and
love
to
listen
to
my
kindle
and
music
while
cleaning
they
are
very
easy
to
pair
to
devices
and
use
the
case
is
great
because
you
can
charge
your
phone
from
it
as
well
also
comes
with
nice
bag
to
carry
them
in
they
are
comfortable
and
look
sleek
in
the
ear
as
well
not
too
bulky
excellent
quality
soundi
decided
to
buy
an
earbuds
for
myself,
here
are
my
thoughts:•
package:
the
wireless
earbuds
come
in
nice
portable
case,
which
acts
as
both
carrying
protecting
case
and
as
charging
station,
small
enough
ti
be
carried
in
the
purse•
size/fit:
tested
the
earbuds
during
run
on
the
treadmill
and
they
did
not
feel
loose,
very
comfortable
fit•
connectivity:
the
earbuds
connect
automatically
to
my
phonegreat
earbuds,
recommended
for
running
or
walking
my
friend
bought
this
and
was
able
to
try
it
for
whole
day,
and
from
what
could
tell,
so
far,
it
has
been
very
good
was
not
able
to
hear
any
outside
noise
and
the
sound
quality
is
pretty
good
what
can
say
is
that
it
is
really
good
alternative
to
more
expensive
bluetooth
earbuds
and
would
really
recommend
it
also
nice
plus
is
that
the
case
is
portable
battery
so
that's
really
convenient
would
have
to
say
after
using
these
for
few
months
that
they
are
the
worse
wireless
ear
buds
have
ever
used
when
they
did
work
the
sound
quality
was
ok
at
best
do
get
sound
out
of
one
but
the
other
ear
bud
will
not
pair
can't
say
much
more
about
them
other
than
to
save
your
money
and
purchase
something
else
i've
been
using
for
about
months
now
use
them
while
wearing
motorcycle
helmet
which
has
tight
fit
over
the
ears
obviously
can't
touch
the
earbuds
while
wearing
my
motorcycle
helmet
but
once
have
them
turned
on
can
adjust
the
volume
from
my
phone
they
work
well
what
an
amazing
buy
sa
far
so
good,
had
these
headphones
for
months
not
once
they
fail
or
stop
working
an
amazing
products
for
the
prizes
listed
the
noise
canceling
features
not
the
very
best
but
it
definitely
better
then
most
prized
headphones
out
on
the
market
mainly
used
them
while
at
work
to
turn
out
my
coworkers
noises
and
listen
to
music
they
are
very
easy
to
connect
through
bluetooth
would
definitely
buy
them
again
and
also
recommend
them
to
friends
&
family
the
$0
price
point
is
very
acceptable
the
pairing
when
smoothly
with
my
lgg0
as
of
this
writing,
i've
only
used
them
once,
during
minute
run
my
phone
stayed
in
running
belt
never
lost
or
had
hiccup
in
connection
and
the
sound
quality
was
acceptablei
cannot
comment
on
battery
life
yet,
as
haven't
used
them
long
enough
to
drain
them
in
single
use
or
recharge
from
completely
deadi'm
not
fan
of
the
rubber
buds
for
the
ear
pieces,
they
feel
little
on
the
cheaper/flimsy
side
took
the
buds
off
another
pair
of
headphones
insteadtl;dr
perfectly
fine
for
casual
running
and
use,
price
is
fair
battery
life
dies
at
almost
exactly
hrs,
just
as
advertisedoriginal
earbuds
tips
were
too
smallone
of
my
headphones
went
through
the
washer
and
dryer
on
accident
and
it
still
works
greatprotip:
get
the
0rd
party
memory
foam
earbuds
the
sound
is
excellent
they
worked
perfectly
for
while,
now
the
right
earbud
is
quieter
than
the
left
even
when
adjusting
the
balance/panning
to
be
bit
towards
the
right,
the
right
earbud
has
much
less
high
end
than
the
left
quick
online
search
revealed
that
this
exact
problem
is
not
uncommonit
too
bad
because,
in
spite
of
the
poor
microphone
quality,
was
enjoying
these
earbuds
for
their
sound
quality,
comfort
and
battery
life
bought
these
earbuds
to
replace
my
travel
headset
and
love,
love,
love
them
use
one
at
time
while
drive
for
safety
its
great
that
one
can
charge
while
i'm
using
the
other
so
can
make
long
drive
and
have
battery
all
day
changing
from
one
ear
bud
to
the
other
is
so
easy
listen
to
audible
and
podcasts
while
drive
the
audio
quality
and
volume
is
excellent
spent
lot
of
time
deciding
which
earbuds
to
purchase
and
am
very
happy
with
these
the
sound
quality
is
good
wish
the
battery
lasted
longer
it
does
only
give
you
hours
like
the
independent
functionality
of
each
bud
it
would
be
nice
of
there
were
actual
buttons
or
symbols
on
them
so
could
know
for
sure
if
the
command
i'm
giving
is
being
received
the
charge
time
is
fast
like
themjust
afraid
of
losing
them
the
manufacturer
has
nothing
to
do
with
that
though
lol***update
***
the
sound
on
phone
calls
is
bad
everyone
complains
that
they
can't
hear
me
or
that
sound
muffled
love
these
headphones
for
the
price
use
them
for
working
out
they
stay
in
my
ears
pretty
well
had
to
get
pair
replaced
after
about
six
months
cus
one
headphone
was
really
quiet
the
new
pair
cannot
go
more
then
ft
away
from
my
phone
before
it
starts
breaking
out
just
used
them
for
swimming
for
the
first
time
since
they
are
waterproof
will
say
they
stood
up
to
the
pool
but
the
second
water
hits
it
it
thinks
my
finger
is
on
it
so
it
will
either
pause
or
activate
siri
so
yes
they
can
stand
up
to
water
but
they
constantly
stop
the
music
because
thinks
pressing
on
it
for
the
most
part
though
they
work
great
the
fully
charged
battery
did
not
even
last
hour
bus
trip
and
only
used
it
half
that
time
also,
not
good
at
noise
cancellationi
really
hoped
for
honest
reviews
but
the
performance
of
these
ear
buds
is
very
disappointing
really
loved
everything
about
these
but
unfortunately
the
left
ear
piece
disconnected
and
hasn
been
working
for
months
really
love
them
but
it
beyond
frustrating
to
have
bought
these
and
as
soon
as
the
warranty
expires
they
brake
literally
at
the
month
mark
they
would
not
connected
for
to
my
phone
for
about
month
these
are
great
they
look
cool,
don
fall
out,
have
touch
controls
for
volume
and
stuff,
and
the
battery
life
is
good
to
average
but
the
addition
of
the
battery
case
makes
it
crazy
good
doesn
block
all
ambient
noise
but
for
running
or
at
the
gym,
that
good
thing

what
liked:connecting

was
breezegood
audio

basssound
cancelingcall
capabilityyou
can
charge
them
on
the
go
with
the
casethe
case
also
acts
as
power
bankwhat
didn't
like:why
never
bought
these
soonerdo
it
it's
really
good
purchase
the
earbuds
were
working
fine
until
the
fourth
month
when
one
of
the
earbuds
won't
stay
in
the
case
to
charge
it
pops
out
and
won't
stay
in
the
case
to
charge
this
is
my
second
purchase
black
one
for
family
member
since
was
pleased
with
my
first
order
white
one
have
to
use
the
white
case
from
my
first
order
to
charge
the
black
earbud
that
keeps
popping
out
reached
out
to
product
support
but
they
won't
help
since
it's
been
over
days
am
waiting
to
hear
back
from
the
seller
they
work
great,
just
wish
the
batteries
in
them
lasted
little
longer
in
them,
they
last
about
hours
so
just
alternate
which
ear
have
in
and
by
the
time
the
one
dies
the
other
is
charged
up
again
bought
these
thinking
they
had
very
long
battery
life
but
they
have
good
sound
and
i've
had
no
troubles
with
them
i'm
overall
happy
with
the
purchase
not
bad
for
the
money
only
slight
complaint
that
may
be
dealbreaker
for
others
is
that
theyre
not
best
for
exercising
you
can
get
away
with
lifting
weights,
but
any
action
sports/running
involved
while
wearing
these
you'll
find
yourself
often
putting
them
back
in
as
they
frequently
get
loose
otherwise
great
sound
quality
when
they
work,
they
work
great
unfortunately,
they
don't
connect
very
well
to
phones
which
is
very
disappointing
wish
would
have
realized
this
when
was
still
within
the
return
window
not
too
sure
about
the
battery
life
as
usually
get
about
minutes
into
run
when
quit
on
these
and
turn
to
my
corded
headphones
wish
the
company
would
offer
return
the
set
up
was
easy
sound
is
nice
and
clear
though
the
bass
is
lacking
little
noise
cancelling
is
great
and
the
people
around
you
can
hear
what
you
re
listening
to
also,
they
stay
in
your
ears
which
have
hard
time
with
since
my
ears
are
small
but
didn
have
problem
with
these
overall,
great
quality
for
the
price
so
purchased
these
earbuds
mainly
to
use
at
work
found
that
they
worked
really
well
the
sound
is
very
clear
also
liked
the
fact
that
they
stay
charged
all
day
the
case
is
cool
because
that's
where
you
charge
them
and
it
also
has
the
usb
so
you
can
charge
your
phone
as
well
great
product,
great
price
trying
to
find
pair
of
airpodesk
earbuds
these
are
fairly
goodthe
sound
is
pleasant
with
only
slight
distortion
in
the
high
end
when
it
gets
too
loudpairing
is
simple
and
relatively
straight
forward
after
the
first
time,
but
it
may
be
little
challenging
at
firstbattery
life
is
average
for
this
sort
of
product,
about
hours
per
charge
of
earbuds,
and
more
in
the
casingthe
added
gimmick
of
charging
your
phone
is
nice
to
have
in
pinch,
but
never
good
first
choiceat
the
end
of
the
day
you
wont
find
another
pair
of
earbud
with
similar
make
for
the
same
low
price
would
recomend
these
are
very
comfortable
earbuds
to
wear
and
the
sound
quality
is
great
charge
them
every
night
and
the
battery
lasts
the
entire
day
i'm
not
non
stop
listening
but
listen
on
my
way
to
the
gym,
at
the
gym,
and
on
my
ride
home
they're
made
very
well
and
are
definitely
built
to
last
i'd
definitely
recommend
these
to
anyone
in
the
market
for
wireless
earbuds,
you
won't
be
disappointed
these
bluetooth
wireless
ears
buds
are
great
have
been
search
for
something
to
wear
while
working
out
and
doing
work
these
were
reasonable
price
and
love
that
got
them
they
come
with
multiple
exchangeable
rubber
ear
pieces
that
you
can
test
out
to
see
which
one
fits
best
for
you
ear
am
able
to
wear
them
and
they
do
not
fall
out
love
the
case
that
charges
them
on
the
go
if
they
needed
to
be
changed
the
case
has
magnet
to
make
sure
the
earbuds
are
properly
placed
in
the
charging
case
and
charging
would
purchase
these
again
and
if
you
ve
been
looking
for
wireless
ear
buds
try
these,
you
won
regret
it
pros:*
small
and
compact*
sweatproof*
stays
in
ears
throughout
strenuous
movements*
sound
quality
is
greatcons:*
bluetooth
connection
was
challenging
at
first*
earbuds
seem
to
hurt
my
ears
little
after
wearing
them
for
more
than
an
hour
the
headphones
are
great
for
portability,
comfort,
and
sound
quality
if
you
have
issues
carrying
around
the
bulky
case
everywhere
you
go,
these
are
not
ideal
the
only
way
to
turn
off
the
headphones
is
by
putting
them
back
into
the
case
even
though
the
manual
indicates
that
you
can
power
off
by
holding
down
the
multi
function
button
confirmed
this
with
the
seller
via
email
they
suggested
turning
off
bluetooth
on
the
phone
and
then
the
headphones
will
turn
off
after
about
minutes
in
my
experience,
as
soon
as
turn
bluetooth
back
on,
the
headphones
pair
with
the
device,
the
last
program
that
was
using
the
headphones
starts
up
again,
and
the
battery
drains
without
your
knowledge
do
hope
the
manufacturer
updates
the
settings
and
allows
for
the
buds
to
be
turned
off
on
demand
without
the
case
used
them
at
the
gym
fit
comfortably
inside
ear,
sound
quality
was
good,
didn't
fall
out
while
was
doing
normal
free
weight
and
cable
lifting
when
walking
on
treadmill
earphones
stayed
in
ear
but
when
running
they
fell
out
carrying
case
was
plus
and
having
usb
port
plus
plus
pretty
good
range
when
walking
through
my
home
talking
on
the
phone
what's
not
to
like
battery
life
is
great,
sound
is
better
or
on
par
with
any
other
completely
wireless
ear
buds
i'm
still
on
the
fence
of
trying
to
see
if
waterproof
or
not
also
wish
there
was
way
to
turn
off
flashing
blue
light
when
in
use
and
not
huge
fan
of
touch
sense
button
i'm
fan
of
an
actual
button
had
these
for
about
two
weeks
and
used
them
some,
but
found
myself
reverting
to
the
wired
buds
that
came
with
my
phone
the
earbuds
fit
well
in
the
ear
and
the
emergency
phone
charger
option
is
great
price
is
gooddisappointing
sound
quality
bass
is
almost
nonexistent
i'm
comparing
this
with
other,
wired
and
wireless,
ear
buds
own
not
bigger
on
or
over
the
ear
headphonesthe
magnetic
charging
is
bit
finicky
have
had
to
reseat
them
to
start
charging
maybe
the
terminals
need
cleaning,
but
they've
done
this
since
newbottom
line
probably
ok
for
exercise
they
stay
in
your
ear
during
all
kinds
of
activity
if
you
don't
care
too
much
about
the
sound
quality
bought
this
headphones
for
work
work
in
office
and
the
office
is
next
to
trash
dumpster
that
makes
loud
noise
when
being
emptied
several
times
day
the
headphones
cancel
out
any
noise,
fit
snug
and
are
barely
noticeable
the
sound
is
crisp
and
clear
absolutely
recommend
these
for
the
price
you're
paying
they
are
worth
it
the
true
test
for
me
is
how
well
bluetooth
earbuds
sync
with
video
have
another,
more
expensive
pair
that
doesn't
sync
audio/video
well
at
all
so
wasn't
really
hoping
for
much
with
these
was
wrong
there
is
no
audio
lag
when
using
these
with
video
on
either
my
phone
or
tablet
the
sound
quality
is
about
what
would
expect
from
any
pair
of
headphones
wired
or
not
and
they
will
not
provide
much
for
noise
cancellation
but
if
you
want
quality
earbuds
at
decent
price
point,
these
are
definitely
the
ones
for
you
was
really
excited
when
purchased
these
earphones,
but
they
were
bit
disappointing
will
preface
this
by
saying
that
bought
these
exclusively
for
use
in
the
gymfirst
they
are
not
good
for
running
or
any
activity
where
you
re
moving
around
lot
because
they
continually
start
slipping
out
used
every
single
one
of
the
sizes
of
earpieces
and
had
the
same
problem
with
all
of
them
what
makes
it
more
frustrating
is
that
when
you
go
to
push
it
the
headphone
thinks
you
re
trying
to
pause
the
music
sensor
in
the
center
of
the
headphone
so
the
music
stopssecond,
the
sound
quality
is
ok,
but
the
bass
is
horrible
the
music
sounds
kind
of
high
pitched
due
to
the
lack
of
bassthird,
probably
the
most
annoying
thing
is
that
one
of
the
earbuds
sounds
louder
then
the
other
tried
turning
them
off
and
then
on
again
but
one
still
sounds
louder
than
the
other
which
is
very
annoying
this
is
the
most
powerful
ear
buds
have
ever
owned
the
sound
is
extremely
clear
the
grip
is
amazing
can
do
all
type
movement
such
hard
exercise
and
it
won't
fall
off
my
ears
the
power
bank
is
the
most
unique
that
can
charge
my
phone
if
need
itdifinately
worth
the
money
love
it
have
been
shopping
for
headphones
and
decided
to
give
these
try
and
wow
was
very
happy
when
they
arrived,
the
easy
to
follow
instructions
made
it
so
simple
to
begin
using
my
headphones
immediately
love
the
lightweight
case
that
use
to
store
and
charge
the
headphones
could
not
believe
the
sound,
have
tried
several
different
brands
and
these
by
far
for
the
cost
have
the
best
sound
they
are
very
comfortable
in
my
ears
and
did
not
irritate
my
ear
at
all
use
my
headphones
when
working
out
and
hiking,
the
great
fit
will
allow
me
to
do
both
without
worrying
that
they
will
come
out
of
my
ears
can
say
without
doubt
these
were
great
purchase,
highly
recommend
them
these
are
literally
the
worst
earbuds
on
the
market
i'll
start
with
the
good,
they
are
comfortable,
but
that's
it
they
do
not
hold
connection
for
even
seconds
without
connecting
and
reconnecting
multiple
times
they
buzz
loudly
when
disconnected,
and
they
are
so
sensitive
and
disconnect
at
the
slightest
touchby
far
the
worst
i've
ever
purchased
these
issues
were
experienced
from
the
onset,
but
tries
to
stick
it
out
ansbfice
them
chance
big
mistake
am
currently
searching
for
replacement
earbud
and
do
not
recommend
these
got
charge
on
these
things
and
popped
them
out
paired
so
easily,
exactly
as
the
instructions
showed
pro
tip
before
you
do
anything
else,
make
sure
you
put
the
runner
earbud
piece
it
comes
with
baggie
of
multiple
sizes
that
fits
the
snuggest
in
your
ears
this
will
stop
them
from
moving
during
exercise
or
movement
of
any
kind
and
provide
much
better
bass
response
for
me,
the
largest
size
was
most
comfortable
and
preferable
for
achieving
the
above
statement
bucks
what
is
this
blade
runner
take
my
money
these
things
are
rad
love
these
earbuds
use
them
everyday
the
sound
quality
is
top
tier
and
the
noise
cancelation
keeps
you
from
having
to
acknowledge
anyone
you
don't
like
the
touch
sensitive
play/pause
makes
you
feel
like
part
of
the
secret
service
my
only
issue
is
very
small
one
will
admit,
i'm
no
expert
on
bluetooth
earbuds
and
their
battery
life,
so
could
be
0%
wrong
but
the
battery
lasts
roughly
hours
before
needing
to
charge
again
which
matches
up
with
my
daily
routine
fairly
well,
but
others
may
find
that
to
be
problem
overall,
if
somehow
lost
these,
would
absolutely
buy
these
again
my
fiancé
absolutely
loves
these
earbuds
no
only
does
the
case
serve
as
charger
for
the
buds
but
also
as
portable
charger
for
your
phone
he
got
them
for
christmas
and
keeps
thanking
me
for
them
didn
know
how
good
the
sound
quality
was
until
just
tried
them
amazing
originally
bought
pair
of
these
for
my
sister
for
christmas
last
year
and
she
really
liked
them
recently
got
myself
pair
and
enjoy
them
as
well
the
sound
is
good
and
they
fit
in
my
ears
great
without
falling
out
while
running,
which
was
big
concern
to
me
the
only
thing
wish
was
that
the
battery
lasted
longer
than
hours
usually
run
and
do
some
other
stuff
at
the
gym
for
over
hours
sometimes
and
the
battery
is
almost
completely
done
while
am
still
working
out
other
than
that,
no
complaints
and
would
strongly
recommend
love
these
work
well
and
syncs
easily
stopped
using
them
though
after
hearing
about
apple
airpods
causing
tumors
granted
everything
gives
cancer
nowadays,
but
figured
might
as
well
reduce
in
ways
can
i've
only
had
my
earbuds
for
about
month
and
they
already
broke
there
is
barely
any
sound
coming
from
the
right
earbud
i've
tried
everything
to
get
the
sound
to
turn
up,
but
it
won't
respond
the
earbuds
fit
nicely
in
my
ears
and
hold
on
just
fine
during
my
extreme
workouts,
but
they
are
just
too
sensitive
when
turning
the
sound
on
or
off
often
wipe
the
sweat
from
my
face
during
my
workouts
and
any
chance
you
slightly
touch
the
side
or
anywhere
on
the
earbuds,
they
turn
off
the
on/off
feature
is
just
too
sensitive
needs
fixing
overall
don't
regret
purchasing
these
but
don't
love
them
i'll
preface
this
by
saying
most
of
my
usage
is
in
nyc,
which
is
probably
different
than
most
at
this
point,
if
am
on
work
call
or
in
very
high
traffic
people
area,
am
not
able
to
use
these
when
you
are
in
crowded
areas,
like
penn
station
or
crowded
subway
station,
the
connection
from
the
phone
to
the
earbuds
breaks
up
considerably
also,
during
call
have
had
few
people
comment
that
is
breaks
up
little
or
the
sound
is
muffledlistening
to
music
on
the
subway,
walking
around
the
city
or
being
inside
has
been
fine
and
it's
certainly
nice
to
not
have
the
wires
enjoy
these
wireless
headphones
have
never
had
ones
that
weren't
corded
before,
however
here
is

fit
until
you
practiced
putting
them
in
few
times
loved
these
earbuds,
because
they
are
clear,
easy
to
operate
and
fit
well
in
my
ears
could
not
be
more
satisfiedi
have
never
had
this
kind
of
earbuds,
and
didn't
know
if
would
like
them,
but
my
son
suggested
try
these,
as
listen
to
music
often
doing
work
around
the
house
and
in
my
office
am
so
glad
did
they
are
awesome
was
scared
they
may
fall
out
while
walking
around,
but
they
fit
snugly
in
my
ears
and
have
the
best
sound
quality
the
quality
of
the
build
is
very
good
instructions
of
the
user
manual
is
easy
to
follow
wish
the
sound
quality
has
bit
more
bass,
midrange
and
high
range
sound
quality
are
very
good
changeable
size
for
the
soft
ear
bud
is
great,
but
it
does
not
feel
comfortable
after
few
minutes
of
wearing
them
wish
the
soft
rubber
of
ear
bud
could
fit
bit
better
and
more
comfortable
was
able
to
pair
with
my
iphone
and
my
windows
laptop
with
bluetooth
easily
my
earbuds
are
no
longer
working
properly,
the
volume
level/
sound
quality
is
different
in
each
ear
have
had
them
for
less
than
year
and
they
are
still
under
manufactured
warrantyi
have
already
messaged
the
company
through
email
and
various
other
outlets
have
gotten
no
email
responses
it
frustrating,
they
have
chance
to
make
things
right
but
choose
not
to
communicate
back
at
allso
far,
very
poor
customer
service
very
easy
to
connect,
charge
and
use
samsung
galaxy
note
smallest
buds
fit
perfect
and
bluetooth
range
is
good
0ish
feet
sound
quality
is
very
good,
some
crackle
on
the
lowest
bass
but
overall
better
than
expected
knocked
off
one
star
because
ordered
in
black,
but
received
white
pair
not
big
enough
issue
to
warrant
an
exchange
or
return
very
pleased
ve
tried
few
different
bluetooth/wireless
earbuds,
and
these
are
easily
my
new
favoritethey
fit
very
comfortably
and
snug
in
my
ear
without
falling
out,
they
re
easy
to
use,
and
they
sound
great
ve
had
no
connection
issues
or
charging
issues
the
charging
case
doubles
as
phone
charger
which
is
nice
feature
too
bought
these
buds
to
use
at
the
gym
hoping
the
ipx0
rating
will
help
them
last
longer
than
others
i've
triedsound
quality
is
good
for
their
size,
the
touch
sensitive
spots
on
them
take
little
getting
used
to,
wind
up
pausing
songs
far
more
often
then
skipping
them
they
last
me
entire
minute
workout
and
the
case
has
them
ready
to
go
for
the
next
time
love
the
fact
that
they
pair
as
soon
as
you
take
them
out
of
the
case
and
shut
off
when
you
put
them
back
inonly
thing
left
to
see
is
how
well
they
survive
month
of
sweaty
gym
workouts
at
first,
the
right
headphone
wasnt
working
but
got
replacement
set
right
away
that
was
pain
in
the
butt
at
first
because
was
looking
forward
to
them
then
they
came
broken
but
getting
the
replacement
set
and
finally
using
them,
they
are
great
the
one
thing
that
really
makes
them
star
worthy
for
me
is
the
battery
life
i've
probably
listened
to
them
over
hrs
since
i've
got
them
and
the
battery
for
the
container
is
still
full
and
the
headphones
are
still
worki
great
have
owned
these
earbuds
for
~0days
have
to
say
the
build
quality
is
great
and
the
sound
quality
is
very
good
for
me
and
my
needs
the
batteries
have
held
up
well
and
the
charging
case
and
taking
phone
calls
works
well,
no
background
noise
that
others
have
picked
up
and
sound
quality
is
excellent
most
importantly,
they
paired
insanely
easily
to
my
iphone
so
must
share
it
with
every
one
love
these
earbuds
others
i've
tried
made
my
ears
sore
after
while
they
were
too
big
these
are
perfect
alot
of
people
complaining
of
no
base
don't
have
an
issue
with
it
it
has
normal
base
to
me
and
can
tweak
it
with
my
phone
everyone
in
my
house
wants
pair
now
lol
the
only
thing
can
say
as
potential
con
is
there
is
no
way
to
adjust
the
volume
on
the
buds
themself
other
than
thatwhat
deal
and
it
charges
my
phone
have
these
for
my
desktop
computer
so
my
videos
don't
bother
anyone
they
stay
charge
for
very
long
time
the
fit
superbly
and
are
easy
to
insert
can
walk
away
from
my
desk
and
have
freedom
to
move
with
these
love
them
good
sound
am
hard
to
impress
and
was
very
skeptical
after
just
having
to
return
smart
watch
was
completely
disappointed
with
but
these
bluetooth
earbuds
are
amazing
so
far,
the
auto
turn
on/off,
auto
connect,
the
charging
case
very
happy
with
this
item
and
awesome
price
know
friends
that
have
paid
over
$0
and
do
not
sound
any
better
also
for
me
anyway
they
fit
perfectly
and
seem
fall
out
that
was
big
concern
got
these
in
august
worked
fairly
well
at
firstsometimes
there
would
be
lost
connection
w/
bluetooth
but
now
the
right
ear
piece
doesn't
have
any
sound,
even
when
its
fully
charged
&
after
resetting
bluetooth
connection
left
ear
piece
works
well
bummed
that
this
product
is
not
usable
after
few
months
hopefully
can
put
these
in
ewaste
recycling
it
hard
to
find
earbuds
that
actually
stay
in
place
and
so
far
these
seem
to
fit
the
bill
was
surprised
at
the
sound
quality
and
it
really
allows
the
music
to
seal
into
your
inner
ear
when
changed
to
more
base
on
the
iphone
these
really
make
difference
ll
be
trying
these
on
the
treadmill
next
this
pair
of
headphones
actually
work
just
as
advertised
and
honestly
for
the
money
they
are
awesome
great
sound
and
love
the
fact
that
these
pair
with
the
phone
when
removed
from
the
charging
case
thank
you
for
making
sure
was
completely
satisfied
tuens
out
these
are
dope
im
on
great
headphone
quest
and
can
not
overstate
how
good
it
is
these
dont
have
chord
to
tangle
not
only
is
it
handy
for
doinf
chores
and
runnig
around
but
every
time
ive
had
headphone
set
die
on
me
it
was
cause
something
happened
to
the
part
where
it
plugs
into
the
phone
no
problem
with
that
here
now
the
battery
does
not
last
hours
but
it
does
few
which
works
just
fine
for
me
the
sound
quality
is
better
than
what
ive
gotten
from
london
drugs
when
need
an
emergency
set
i've
been
using
these
bluetooth
earbuds
for
about
days
now
i've
heard
that
there
can
be
issues
with
pairing
separate
bluetooth
earbuds
in
the
past,
but
these
paired
exactly
as
the
instructions
stated
without
issue
easily
connected
them
to
my
phone
and
was
actually
very
surprised
by
how
great
the
sound
quality
was
for
the
price
point,
as
totally
wireless
earbuds,
these
are
hard
to
beat
if
would
dock
it
for
any
reason
at
all,
would
say
that
the
battery
life
could
be
better
understand
that
the
device
in
nature
is
very
small,
and
there
is
only
so
much
that
can
be
put
into
piece
of
tech
that
fits
into
your
ear,
but
having
more
than
hours
before
recharging
would
be
nice
if
you
are
looking
for
truly
wireless
earbuds,
think
these
are
worth
shot,
and
actually
beat
my
expectations
overall
they
work
great
love
the
sound
quality
and
how
easy
it
is
to
connect
to
my
phone
battery
life
is
good
use
them
at
work
put
them
on
at
0am
don
have
to
charge
till
noon
constantly
listening
to
them
charge
takes
about
minutes
then
back
at
it
again
only
annoying
thing
is
you
can
only
use
the
left
by
itself
have
been
looking
to
find
good
pair
of
wireless
earbuds
this
has
been
hard
as
found
others
have
tried
were
either
uncomfortable,
did
not
stay
in
my
ear
or
had
poor
audio
quality
these
earbuds
were
not
like
the
others
they
are
comfortable,
stay
in
my
ears,
and
sound
great
in
addition
found
the
range
on
these
to
be
quite
good
the
only
negative/concern
have
with
these
is
the
latch
on
the
case
as
it
can
be
little
difficult
to
open
would
recommend
these
to
anyone
who
is
looking
for
nice
all
around
performing
earbuds
thought
these
were
awesome
at
first
the
touch
features
were
good,
they
were
fairly
comfortable
and
the
battery
life
wasn
half
bad,
especially
when
the
buds
can
be
used
one
at
time
for
continuous
use
but
the
big
deal
breaker
for
me,
was
the
volume
output
for
$0,
the
clarity
and
quality
was
amazing,
but
the
volume
was
lacking
significantly
love
listening
to
music
with
bit
of
higher
volume
setting,
and
these
were
not
satisfying
that
itch
for
those
who
watch
let
plays
or
listen
to
podcasts,
this
would
be
amazing
for
that
normally
stick
with
only
buying
apple
products
but
decided
to
try
something
different
am
not
disappointed
at
all
great
fit
and
sound
without
hurting
the
wallet
highly
recommend
these
for
anyone
looking
for
apple
alternatives
not
wanting
to
throw
down
too
much
$$$
for
name
brand
true
wireless
earbuds,
gave
these
shot
based
on
all
of
the
now
questionable
positive
reviews
within
minutes
max
of
trying
these
on,
knew
would
be
returning
them
tried
all
the
included
different
ear
bud
sizes
as
well,
but
none
of
them
made
these
even
sound
remotely
decent
maybe
my
ears
and
these
don
mesh
because
the
buds
never
seemed
to
sit
well
in
my
ears
would
have
to
physically
push
them
in
to
make
the
music
sound
loud
and
clear
once
let
go
of
the
pressure
from
the
hand
pushing
them
in,
they
sounded
terribly
low
once
again
ended
up
returning
these
and
opted
for
another
cheap
option
different
brand
that
much
happier
with
don't
bother
buying
these
the
charging
port
will
stop
working
and
even
though
purchased
the
warranty
they
suggested,
the
warranty
only
covers
products
between
$0
and
$0
so
they
denied
the
claim
which
is
very
misleading
contacted
the
warranty
company
who
said
there
was
nothing
they
could
do
even
though
had
purchased
warranty
so
they
directed
me
to
amazon
and
they
also
said
there
was
nothing
they
could
do
don't
waste
your
money
on
this
product
and
be
careful
buying
warranties
on
amazon
the
earphones
are
very
handy
for
listening
to
music,
not
so
much
for
watching
videos
since
there
is
lag
had
used
these
earphones
mainly
at
the
gym
for
just
under
months
when
one
earbud
stopped
working
contacted
the
seller
and
they
promptly
sent
me
replacement
five
stars
for
excellent
customer
service
these
headphones
are
sleek,
easy
to
use,
and
sounds
great
they
stay
in
your
ear
very
well
the
sound
is
crisp,
clear,
and
loud
and
there
isn't
much
outside
noise
that
can
get
through
that's
big
plus
if
you're
using
while
studying
the
case
is
nice
and
comes
with
nice
carrying
case,
the
charger,
and
different
size
earpieces
i'm
on
tight
budget
and
these
are
very
nice
for
the
price
having
tried
other
sets
of
wireless
earbuds,
found
these
to
be
the
easiest
to
pair
sound
is
very
good
and
they
fit/stay
in
the
ear
very
well
excellent
battery
life
and
so
many
recharges
with
the
charging
case
best
value
in
my
opinion
very
nice
one
easy
to
hide,
touch,
love
how
the
charger
is
also
portable
charger
that
can
be
also
use
on
my
cellphone
etc
great
price
mean
can
go
on
and
on
just
hoping
it
last
for
very
long
time
if
it
does
this
is
fire
will
keep
ya
posted
like
these
earbuds
the
sound
is
pretty
loud,
they
fit
nicely
in
my
ears
and
the
battery
life
is
good
for
about
hours
fully
charged
only
problem
had
duty
these
earbuds
was
that
sometimes
they
pair
with
the
phone
had
to
keep
putting
them
back
in
the
charging
port
or
unpair
and
repair
them
to
work
these
earbuds
were
simple
to
set
up
and
easy
to
use
right
out
of
the
box
they
came
with
an
carrying
case
and
additional
attachments
to
ensure
proper
sizing
great
sound
quality
haven
tried
to
exercise
with
them,
but
would
be
little
nervous
to
use
them
during
exercise
as
not
sure
they
would
stay
in
my
ears
sound
is
skipping
on
and
off
return
and
support
window
is
closed
buy
at
your
own
risk
first
of
all
the
product
doesn
hold
charge
more
then
an
hour
so
if
your
working
is
more
then
that
is
product
is
not
for
you0nd
one
of
the
side
keeps
on
going
in
and
outnoise
cancellation
forget
about
it
this
is
product
is
great
buy
cancels
sound
very
well
and
fits
in
the
ear
wonderfully
the
earbuds
fit
securely
and
don't
worry
about
them
falling
out
they
are
sensitive
to
touch,
which
is
great
to
make
an
easy
switch
to
song
being
played
or
to
end
call
the
magnetic
charging
case
is
very
handy,
protective
and
convenient
when
you're
on
the
go
the
only
unfortunate
thing
is
that
the
earbuds
don't
have
long
battery
life,
but
the
actual
charging
case
lasts
significantly
long
i'm
happy
with
this
product
and
definitely
recommend
over
apple
airpods
earbuds
seemed
to
work
just
fine
with
some
very
minor
flaws
and
issues
more
than
acceptable
considering
the
price
however,
they
stopped
pairing
with
each
other
just
after
the
warranty
went
out
wouldn't
buy
again
absolutely
love
these
ear
buds
awesome
compact
case
that
not
only
charges
your
ear
buds
but
has
usb
port
to
charge
your
phone
as
well
clear
display
when
case
needs
to
be
charged
several
ear
tips
to
ensure
fit
sync
quickly
and
easily
very
clear
sound
quality
they
fit
comfortably
in
your
ear
and
have
made
it
through
numerous
workouts
with
zero
issues
have
been
using
this
pair
of
earbuds
for
days
so
far
so
goodpair
easily
to
my
iphone
and
the
sound
quality
is
nice
this
earbuds
are
touch
controlled,
make
me
easy
to
answer
the
phone
or
to
pause
the
music
when
was
working
nice
purchase
the
sound
is
great
but
they
stick
out
of
my
ears
and
feel
like
they
are
going
to
fall
out
put
the
smallest
foam
covers
on
them
or
else
wouldn
have
been
able
to
get
them
in
my
ears
at
all
ordered
another
brand
and
will
ship
back
the
ones
that
don
work
as
well
do
not
buy
was
very
disappointed
in
this
product
had
it
for
about
weeks
and
the
speaker
for
the
one
ear
bud,
stopped
working
it
sounds
distorted
now
cant
use
the
battery
life
was
great
but
if
the
sound
isnt
working
the
battery
life
means
absolutely
nothing
still
worthless
use
these
headphones
mostly
while
work
out
in
the
gym
don't
have
to
worry
about
them
going
anywhere
when
am
running
or
lifting
weights
and
the
different
earpiece
sizes
make
it
easy
to
ensure
they
fit
comfortably
the
battery
life
seems
to
be
very
good
have
had
them
about
month,
use
them
about
hours
week
and
have
not
yet
had
to
recharge
their
charger
they
are
really
easy
to
use
and
so
far
am
super
happy
with
my
purchase
sound
quality
is
also
pretty
good,
although
if
you
try
having
phone
conversation
with
them
in,
it
is
difficult
to
be
understood
by
the
caller
even
though
you
can
hear
them
well
ve
had
these
for
years
and
they
re
still
working
pretty
well
battery
life
isn
long
enough,
unfortunately
the
phone
call
quality
as
far
as
talking
and
receiving
isn
good
they
re
sweat
resistant,
but
they
don
stay
put
when
you
sweat
ve
had
to
readjust
them
many
times
still,
good
solid
pair
of
bluetooth
ear
buds
drop
the
buds
few
times
and
they
still
work
say
these
are
appropriate
for
someone
who
wants
an
intro
to
the
bluetooth
earbud
world
had
these
for
good
amount
of
time,
and
the
sound
quality
is
amazing
it's
so
convenient
and
the
battery
charging
works
very
well
the
only
reason
why
am
not
giving
this
0star
rating
is
because
have
only
really
used
this
for
about
month
and
half
even
though
bought
it
earlier
and
had
it
for
longer,
and
the
right
earbud
no
longer
has
sound
tried
to
wait
until
the
earbuds
died
and
recharged
it,
but
nothing
worked
the
left
earbud
works
perfectly
fine,
but
the
right
one
no
longer
functions
enjoy
these
ear
pods
very
much
when
it
noise
at
work
can
put
these
in
and
listen
to
music
and
also
when
my
phone
rings
can
here
it
have
dropped
them
few
times
wiped
them
off
stuck
them
back
in
and
still
work
like
champ
enjoy
them
also
when
working
outside
in
the
yard
they
work
great
as
far
as
cutting
grass
weed
eating
can
tune
it
all
out
and
jam
away
long
story
short
recommend
these
to
anyone
who
does
any
type
of
work
outside
you
will
be
very
happy
with
them
they
work
great
for
me
at
the
gym
can
leave
my
phone
in
my
wife's
bag
and
go
around
the
whole
gym
and
not
loose
signal
if
leave
to
go
to
another
part
of
the
building,
it
reconnects
quickly
on
its
own
these
were
great
while
they
lasted
about
month
after
purchasing,
the
right
earbud
would
go
in
and
out
thought
it
was
pairing
issue
because
couldn't
hear
the
"right
device
connected"
when
you
take
them
out
of
the
charging
box
it
wasn't
until
realized
could
still
pause
the
music
with
the
right
bud
that
it
wasn't
pairing
issue
the
sound
was
bad
skip
forward
week
or
so
and
it
has
now
completely
gone
out
unfortunately
i'm
past
the
return
datei
wouldn't
buy
again
typically
like
to
use
headphones
for
more
than
month
these
headphones
are
absolutely
life
changing
they
arrived
to
my
house
in
less
than
hours
lightening
fast
shipping
then
after
opening
the
cutest
little
carrying
and
charging
case,
discovered
just
how
perfect
these
headphones
were
have
never
heard
better
sound
they
sound
magical
super
easy
to
pair
with
any
device
carrying
case
is
the
perfect
size
for
your
pocket,
purse,
or
hand
perfect
gift
so
before
do
review,
like
to
give
it
couple
weeks
to
see
if
the
product
works
as
promised
must
say,
this
product
certainly
delivers
the
product
doesn't
pop
out
of
my
ears
like
many
headphones
do
the
connection
is
always
fast
and
stable
owned
competitor's
product
that
returned
because
the
connection
was
extremely
unreliable
sound
quality
and
noise
cancellation
are
excellent
and
the
battery
life
as
expected
is
good
as
well
hope
this
helps
the
wired
earphones
that
used
before
broke
recently
so
was
looking
into
some
wireless
onesit
wasn't
expensive
compared
to
other
wireless
earphones
and
had
good
reviews
so
bought
it
and
think
it
is
worth
for
its
price
pairing
was
easy,
sound
is
nice,
charging
case
is
good
size,
touch
button
on
earphone
comes
in
handy
sometimes,
and
used
it
once
so
far
for
call
and
the
receiver
said
it
sounded
fine
when
bragged
was
using
wireless
earphone
to
talk
if
you
want
wireless
earphones
that
are
not
too
expensive,
personally
think
this
ones
not
bad
at
all
from
the
very
first
day
one
of
the
earbuds
keeps
disconnecting
for
second
every
second
when
you
walk
and
phone
is
in
pockets
to
be
able
to
listen
with
no
issues,
you
have
to
stand
still
or
keep
your
phone
super
close
to
them
so
there
is
nothing
between
ohhh
my
goshi
am
amazed
that
this
is
only
like
$0
had
pair
of
wire
bluetooth
earbuds
the
battery
wasn
great
and
whenever
the
battery
ran
out
had
to
take
them
out
and
find
an
outlet
to
plug
it
into
these
are
so
much
more
convenient
with
the
case
being
the
charger
and
they
charge
very
fast
the
noise
cancellation
is
so
good
that
my
family
gets
annoyed
the
sound
quality
is
also
amazing
bruh,
and
here
was
about
to
spend
$0
on
airpods
happy
found
these
love
these
the
left
one
isn
as
loud
as
the
right
one
which
is
little
annoying
but
they
hold
battery
and
are
decent
with
noise
cancellation
going
to
buy
set
for
my
boyfriend
just
received
these
earbuds
yesterday
and
so
far
really
like
them
they
were
easy
to
pair
with
my
device
they
fit
in
my
ears
comfortably
the
sound
quality
was
quite
good
my
purpose
is
more
to
listen
to
music
then
for
phone
call
didn't
test
them
with
moisture
or
water
yet
used
for
quite
awhile
and
the
charge
held
really
well
the
charging
case
is
great
for
the
price
felt
it
was
great
value,
would
totally
recommend
received
this
product
for
my
honest
review
love
these
shopped
around
for
an
apple
alternative
don
like
the
feeling
and
after
looking
at
many
more
expensive
options
decided
to
try
these
they
re
comfortable,
easy
to
use,
and
long
lasting
have
only
run
out
of
battery
once,
when
used
them
off
and
on
for
few
days
without
charging
had
one
issue
with
the
headphones
pairing
to
each
other,
but
amazon
support
was
able
to
help
me
trouble
shoot
quickly
and
they
re
back
and
running
without
any
problems
highly
recommend
these
headphones
are
great
for
listening
to
music
and
do
good
job
of
staying
in,
just
walking
have
done
yard
work
and
worked
on
vehicles
using
these
with
no
problems
of
them
falling
out
where
they
are
not
good
is
for
phone
calls
you
can
hear
them
well
but
the
mics
are
not
very
good
complaints
of
hearing
surrounding
noise
moreso
was
common
solid
budget
bids
good
product
battery
life
is
great
noise
cancellation
is
good
sound
quality
could
be
little
better
taking
phone
calls
is
less
than
ideal
from
what
understand
from
my
friends,
they
pick
up
lot
of
background
noise
if
you're
in
quiet
room,
by
yourself,
they
work
great
but
if
you're
on
busy
street,
or
public
setting,
they're
not
the
best
to
use
use
this
product
to
listen
to
music
at
work
it
is
perfect
gave
the
battery
life
stars,
because
usually
only
listen
to
one
ear
bud
at
time,
that
way
can
hear
what
going
on
around
me
the
sound
it
still
great
they
tend
to
die
after
few
hours,
but
can
listen
to
the
other
one
while
the
first
needs
to
charge
noise
cancellation
is
strong,
which
is
why
only
use
one
bus
at
time
they
fit
and
stay
in
your
ear
well
was
iffy
about
spending
$0
on
ear
buds,
but
we
ll
worth
it
cordless
is
amazing
don't
waste
your
time
with
this
product
spend
few
dollars
more
and
go
for
better
brand
this
is
cheap
chinese
knock
offthe
problems:
the
right
earbud
always
fails
after
couple
of
weeks
of
use
i've
had
two
separate
pairs;
it's
design
flaw
there's
no
way
to
properly
turn
off
the
earphones,
so
they
continue
to
charge
in
their
case
until
the
case
battery
drainswhat
waste
of
time
look
elsewhere
if
you
want
reliable
pair
of
earbuds
in
your
life
earbuds
last
about
hours
before
having
to
recharge
the
lithium
battery
lasts
long
time
before
having
to
charge
don
like
how
you
can
just
have
one
earbud
in
and
the
other
on
the
charger
they
don
fall
out
when
running
and
work
great
this
is
the
happiest
i've
been
in
while
with
purchase
in
general
my
expectations
were
pretty
low
because
of
the
price
but
am
so
happy
with
these
headphones
the
charging
concept
is
easy
to
use
and
it
was
really
easy
to
sync
have
tiny
ears
but
they
have
yet
to
fall
out
despite
the
size
the
earbuds
arrived
quickly
and
in
good
condition
the
left
earbud
didn't
charge
or
light
up
completely
dead
tried
the
right
earbud,
and
it
sounded
awful
very
tinny
sound
too
bad,
because
the
earbuds
and
their
charging
box
seemed
very
well
thought
out
by
the
way,
read
the
instructions
carefully,
removed
the
plastic
tabs
from
the
charging
contacts,
placed
the
bud
correctly
in
my
ear
canal,
cleaned
the
contacts,
etc
i've
been
using
wired
inear
earbuds
for
years
and
have
been
very
happy
with
their
acoustics
i'm
surprised
that
these
bluetooth
earbuds
are
so
positively
reviewed
returned
for
refund
they
feel
good
they
work
better
than
expected
just
in
terms
of
functionality
didn't
know
about
answering
phone
calls
and
touching
the
actual
bud
however
months
on
and
the
left
earpiece
has
half
the
volume
as
the
right
earpiece
which
of
course
throws
you
off
and
sounds
like
i'm
hearing
everything
out
of
the
right
side
of
my
face
don't
know
what
that's
about
don't
know
if
it's
some
reset
situation
or
what
don't
know
if
it's
going
out
it's
still
responds
to
the
signals
and
it's
the
pairing
piece
and
it's
still
pairs
like
it's
supposed
to
it
just
has
half
the
volume
and
can't
raise
the
volume
on
the
left
side
anymore
purchased
these
for
music/podcast
listening
only,
so
can
comment
on
the
phone
call
qualityfor
audio
purposes
only,
these
work
very
well
they
were
fully
charged
out
of
the
box,
synced
with
my
phone
easily,
and
fit
in
the
ear
very
well
wore
them
for
several
hours
the
first
day,
and
had
no
issues
with
them
feeling
loose
or
following
out,
and
the
battery
life
was
no
issuethe
sound
may
not
be
audiophile
quality,
but
they
re
by
no
means
cheap
sounding
and
for
the
price
these
are
tough
to
beat
headphones
worked
for
day
the
all
of
sudden,
the
left
earphone
volume
became
very
quiet
it
still
plays
music,
but
the
volume
level
is
whisper
compared
the
the
right
earphone
connected
to
multiple
devices
to
troubleshoot
nothing
has
worked
waste
of
$0
also,
it's
too
easy
to
accidentally
touch
the
touchsensor
when
simply
adjusting
the
headphones
it
should
really
be
controlled
by
physical
buttons
disappointed
in
this
product
this
is
an
easy
to
use
product
with
really
good
quality
comes
in
really
nice
box,
making
it
good
looking
gift
like
how
it
charges
the
ear
bud
in
the
case
which
makes
it
convenient
was
able
to
connect
to
the
ear
buds
from
my
phone
easily
it
fits
my
ear
really
well
and
has
good
sound
quality
love
this
use
this
everyday
so
far
few
hours
of
music,
tending
calls
sound
is
good
and
clear
easy
to
pair
and
extra
ear
cushions
to
make
the
right
fit
the
box
holds
charge
for
long
time
it
has
been
week
of
everyday
use
of
about
0hrs
day
and
the
box
is
running
on
two
lights
on,
still
would
recommend
these
earbuds
actually
stay
put
in
your
ears
while
working
out
and
moving
about,
hard
to
come
by
love
that
they
charge
inside
the
case,
helps
me
not
lose
charging
cords
and
pieces
and
easily
came
with
lots
of
extra
ear
bud
covers,
appreciated
since
those
tend
to
disappear
easily
these
are
well
work
the
price
am
impressed
with
the
quality
0*****
i've
been
most
impressed
with
the
call
quality
surprisingly
wouldn't
mind
little
more
bass
but
considering
the
cost,
these
are
outstanding
headphones
they
are
extremely
comfortable
lift,
intensely,
days
per
week
dead
lifts,
squats,
circuits,
cardio,
lot
of
movement
and
sweat
and
have
had
no
issues
with
these
staying
comfortably
in
my
ears
they
pair
more
easily
than
the
other
three
sets
of
wireless
headphones
own
really
cannot
recommend
these
enough
note,
that
purchased
these
in
april
and
three
months
later
am
just
as
happy
got
these
pair
of
earbuds
week
ago,
they
are
"awesome",i
was
little
surprise
of
the
quality,
it
's
great
and
they
are
really
waterproof,
wear
them
to
take
shower
and
listen
to
the
song,
the
sound
still
come
out
very
clear,on
the
bluetooth
side,
once
you
connected
it,
they
will
automatically
connected
everytime
you
took
them
out
from
the
charging
box
like
immediately,
the
charging
box
can
be
power
bank
as
well,what
are
great
feature
of
it,battery
life
last
very
long,i
only
charged
it
one
time
when
got
them
since
one
week
ago
,very
nice
product
guess
for
the
price
they're
not
bad
sound
is
good
for
listening
to
pod
casts
and
not
so
good
for
music
use
them
while
riding
my
motorcycle
and
the
noise
cancelation
is
non
existent
plus
sometimes
the
pod
gets
touched,
activating
seri
but
they
don't
cost
0,
so
yeah,
they
are
good
deal
as
an
owner
of
the
bose
soundsport
wireless
earbuds
was
very
surprised
with
the
quality
of
these
ear
buds
have
small
ears
and
right
out
the
package
they
fit
perfectly
go
to
the
gym
at
least
four
times
week
and
the
never
fell
out
despite
the
rigorous
activity
also
have
to
say
that
they
are
very
sleek
and
discreet
when
wearing
these
you
feel
like
secert
agent
because
they
are
so
small
would
recommend
this
product
to
all
of
those
that
are
looking
for
good
bluetooth
earbuds
to
workout
with
but
don't
want
to
break
the
bank
these
were
exactly
what
was
looking
for
they
paired
quickly
and
easily
bass
is
good
once
you
choose
the
correct
size
earpiece
you
need
tight
seal
to
create
the
bass
chamber
inside
your
ear
canal,
otherwise
it
will
sound
tinnyi've
only
had
them
for
few
days,
but
used
them
at
the
gym
and
they
were
by
far
the
most
comfortable
and
best
performing
earbuds
i've
usedand
the
price
is
great
definitely
recommend
these
these
work
so
well
that
my
fiancé
doesn
hear
word
say
can
literally
yell
at
him
from
the
next
room
without
him
flinching
had
to
ask
him
how
loud
his
music
was
playing,
but
apparently
the
noise
cancellation
works
that
well
he
loves
the
quality
and
portability
of
them
earbuds
sound
very
good
and
stay
in
place
when
working
out,
to
include
running
the
first
pair
lasted
months
before
the
right
side
when
dead
customer
service
responded
quickly
and,
after
verification,
sent
replacement
set
right
away
overall
good
value
for
the
money,
very
good
sound,
and
excellent
customer
service
pasonomi
designed
nice
bluetooth
earbuds
with
excellent
quality
they
can
pair
each
other
and
turn
on/off
automatically
they're
ideal
for
exercise,
too
however,
it's
tricky
to
activate
and
use
them
for
the
first
time
was
looking
for
quality
earbud
at
reasonable
price
cause
was
not
about
to
spend
over
$0
for
an
apple
product
stumble
upon
these
while
browsing
on
amazon
and
decided
to
take
chance
with
them
i've
been
using
them
for
over
week
now
and
couldn't
be
happier
the
quality
is
surprisingly
great
for
the
price
point,
easily
connect
to
my
phone
and
pc,
my
wife
can
hear
me
clearly
the
battery
life
is
great
overall,
this
is
solid
product
and
recommend
it
run
long
distance
and
constantly
have
my
earphones
in,
so
these
were
perfect
for
running
excellent
on
noise
cancellation
and
amazing
overall
performance
in
general
the
one
thing
that
has
been
an
issue
is
being
unable
to
communicate
to
the
other
party
during
phone
call
can
hear
them
but
they
cannot
hear
me
other
than
that,
these
are
amazing
earphones
that
really
love
so
this
product
did
not
hit
star
for
me
for
couple
reasons
the
range
of
this
product
was
not
satisfying
am
delivery
driver
and
im
in
and
out
of
my
vehicle
constantly,
but
going
to
someone's
door
would
loose
connection
fairly
quick
even
after
keeping
my
phone
in
my
pocket
would
loose
connectionthat
being
said
still
gave
this
stars
simply
because
the
hardware
itself
is
so
well
put
together
the
beautiful
carrying
case
that
it
comes
with
keeps
everything
together
the
magnetic
charger
is
really
cool
feature
and
the
ability
to
charge
second
device
is
very
convenient
absolutely
love
these
earphones
have
really
small
ear
canals,
so
any
inear
headphones
are
either
really
pain
fungus
or
fall
out,
but
these
are
perfect
can
run
without
them
falling
out,
and
the
sound
quality
is
fantastic
highly
recommend
really
wanted
to
like
these
earbuds
they
were
affordable,
comfortable,
connected
easily
and
easy
to
use
however,
consistently
had
issues
with
the
right
side
and
ultimately
both
sides
cutting
in
and
out
while
listening
to
musici
couldn
play
complete
song
without
it
breaking
up
or
dropping
out
there
is
procedure
for
resetting
the
earbuds
that
was
supposed
to
resolve
this
issue
the
seller
maintains
facebook
page
for
q&a
which
also
viewed
but
to
no
avail
went
so
far
as
to
get
replacement
set
thinking
it
was
just
the
pair
was
using
same
resultsbottom
line,
they
did
not
work
for
me
and
one
should
not
have
to
reset
earbuds
every
couple
of
minutes
to
get
them
to
work
correctly
this
seems
like
an
engineering
flaw
to
meboth
pairs
were
returned
to
amazon
pros:
from
design
perspective,
the
ear
buds
sits
well
in
the
ear
it
falls
sometimes,
but
that
is
expected
in
these
ear
pods
sound
quality
is
okaycons:
the
overall
connectivity
is
very
bad,
bluetooth
disconnects
quiet
frequentlypay
more
and
buy
branded
set
gave
as
xmas
gift
was
able
to
hear
them
and
was
pleased
with
the
sound
wish
the
lows
bass
were
little
bit
more
pronounced
but
thinking
of
getting
pair
for
myself
know
just
got
these
earphones
today,
but
so
far
they
have
been
working
great
the
battery
life
seems
solid,
love
the
charger,
the
sound
is
good
they
fit
my
ears
just
fine,
didn't
even
need
to
try
any
of
the
other
attachments
the
only
tricky
thing
was
getting
only
the
right
earbud
to
work
by
itself
the
left
one
had
no
problem
doing
that,
but
the
right
one
was
tricky
would
def
recommend
if
you
need
solid
pair
of
earbuds,
after
lost
my
favourite
bluetooth
headphones,
couldn't
find
one
to
replace
it
some
of
them
are
too
big
that
makes
me
feel
they
are
falling
off
this
headphone
actually
fit
my
ears
and
feel
comfortable
the
sound
quality
is
good
and
good
for
working
out
the
only
disadvantage
would
say
is
that
the
case
is
too
big
love
these
headphones
the
material
and
shape
is
comfortable,
comes
with
multiple
sizes
for
the
piece
to
fit
on
the
outer
edge
of
the
ear
canal
the
sound
is
excellent
blocks
out
the
sound
of
teenage
boy
playing
ps0huge
plus
use
them
for
audio
books
for
nursing
school
while
doing
house
work
they
stay
out
during
moving
around/dancing/cleaning
ordered
and
received
these
wireless
earbuds
about
half
month
ago
and
can
safely
say
that
they
are
worth
the
purchasefor
or
less
the
price
is
greati
have
had
mine
fall
in
water
and
work
perfectly
fine
afterwardsthe
battery
life
is
fine,
but
gets
much
better
if
you
do
keep
the
charging
pod
with
youi
use
one
earbud
at
time
and
was
able
to
adjust
the
size
to
fit
mine,
it
works
great
and
lasts
longcalls
glitch
slightly,
although
don't
believe
it's
the
fault
of
the
productso,
i'd
say
they
are
definitely
worth
checking
out
literally
purchased
these
times
and
all
times
had
the
same
issues
short
battery
life,
and
can't
be
used
to
talk
on
because
the
person
on
the
other
line
can't
hear
you
it's
just
this
brand
that
is
no
good
ended
up
buying
the
trx
ones
and
loved
them
had
to
give
my
apple
earbuds
to
my
wife
because
they
kept
slipping
out
of
my
ears
did
quite
bit
of
research
before
pulled
the
trigger
on
these
pasonomis
and
glad
did
first
of
all
they
fit
in
my
ears
great
ve
had
them
out
running
and
stayed
right
in
place
the
sound
is
also
very
good
and
think
they
sound
just
as
good
as
the
applesthe
earbuds
fit
great
in
the
charging
case
and
the
battery
life
is
excellent
so
far
very
happy
with
this
choice
and
would
recommend
loving
these
ear
buds
they
are
really
easy
to
set
up
and
easy
to
use
great
for
mom
constantly
on
the
go
can
easily
tap
the
ear
bud,
and
press
play/
pause/
or
answer
quick
phone
call
they
are
extremely
comfortable
as
well
also
really
like
the
charging
case
makes
it
super
convenient
to
keep
them
charged
highly
recommend
them
the
pasonomi
wireless
headphones
are
decent
headphones
to
use
they
don't
have
lot
of
bass
and
aren't
super
loud
if
that's
what
you
are
looking
for
but
they
get
the
job
done
they
stay
in
your
ear
pretty
well
but
can
get
little
uncomfortable
after
using
them
for
while
the
only
annoying
thing
about
these
headphones
is
the
sensor
on
both
earpieces
that
pauses
the
music
when
you
are
trying
to
readjust
the
earpiece
and
it
keeps
pausing
because
your
hand
naturally
touches
the
sensor
other
than
that
i'm
satisfied
with
them
the
earbuds
pair
really
fast
and
are
easy
to
setup
sound
quality
is
good,
but
it
picks
up
lot
of
background
noise
on
the
microphone
it
lasts
long
time
and
are
easy
to
recharge
am
not
an
earbud
person,
hate
putting
things
in
my
ear
but
these
earbuds
are
very
comfortable
overall
user
experience
is
poor:
these
have
touch
sensitive
surfaces
with
no
feedback
so,
the
lack
of
real
buttons
constantly
results
in
me
accidently
pausing
my
music
as
adjust
the
fit
in
my
earsound
quality
is
poor
compared
to
other
brand
bluetooth
earbudsthe
charge
box
for
these
are
bulky
compared
to
other
brandsit
is
difficult
to
open
the
lid
of
the
charging
box
the
sound
quality
on
these
headphones
is
amazing
before
get
into
that
i'm
going
to
talk
about
the
packaging
and
the
casethe
packaging
is
what
you
would
expect
from
highend
headphone
company
see
picture
the
case
itself
is
super
sleek
and
small
enough
to
fit
in
your
pocket
or
in
the
small
bag
providedthe
headphones
stay
in
your
ear
when
moving
around
and
the
battery
life
seems
really
good
have
apple
air
pods
also
and
these
last
longer
than
those
per
chargeoverall
an
amazing
product
and
worth
the
cost
honestly,
for
the
price
would
give
these
stars
except
for
one
reason
when
lost
the
left
earbud,
it
rendered
the
whole
thing
useless
because
the
left
earbud
works
as
the
"parent"
earbud
guess
you
could
say
so
you
cannot
pair
only
with
the
right
earbud,
which
is
honestly
shame
for
the
bucks
paid
though,
got
the
sound
quality,
battery
life,
etc
that
expected,
in
general
pretty
useful
especially
for
working
out
some
people
also
said
it
fell
out
with
running
but
never
had
that
issue
i've
had
other
wireless
earbuds
but
these
are
probably
the
worst
they
feel
cheap,
like
they're
gonna
break
if
you
drop
them
the
sound
quality
is
average
it's
good
for
listening
to
podcasts
but
music
is
pretty
staticy
the
worst
part
about
them
is
the
horrible
rubber
things
that
go
in
your
ear
i've
had
ones
that
are
uncomfortable,
too
big
or
too
small,
but
these
just
hurt
after
about
minutes
of
these
being
in
have
to
take
them
out
because
of
the
sharp
pain
in
my
ears
i've
tried
every
size
but
they
all
have
the
same
effect
don't
waist
your
money,
get
soundpeats
instead
they
are
comfortable
and
have
better
audio
quality
for
cheaper
price
this
product
arrived
quickly
packaged
neatly
in
box
included
were
the
ear
buds,
recharging
case,
charger
for
the
case,
carrying
bag,
and
extra
filters
the
ear
buds
are
easy
to
connect
to
smartphone
the
sound
is
great
you
can
pause
and
play
music
by
tapping
on
the
ear
buds
love
how
the
ear
buds
are
magnetically
kept
in
the
case
for
easy
charging
for
some
reason
they
wont
pair
together
either
one
works
or
the
other
never
at
the
same
time
all
was
good
for
me
except
its
not
as
waterproof
as
it
says,
two
times
in
heavy
rain
and
it
was
defective,
maybe
it
was
just
mine
but
yeah,
other
that
that
they
are
pretty
good
for
the
price
the
type
of
waterproof
it
is
is
supposed
to
me
up
to
one
meter
for
0mins
think
but
it
is
not
ordered
this
on
december
0th
and
today
is
february
0th
so
ive
had
time
to
get
to
know
them
they
suck
sometimes
they
do
not
connect
and
when
they
do
on
those
times
the
sound
is
low
and
low
quality
they
do
not
work
single
earbid
at
time
if
thats
what
you
want
no
actual
buttons
to
control
either
its
no
for
me
and
waste
of
money
so
far
with
limited
usage;
it
appears
to
be
decent
ear
buds
am
planning
to
buy
couple
more
as
gifts
as
these
are
getting
more
popular
and
functional
these
days
and
this
will
be
definite
contender
unless
can
get
similar
quality
at
cheaper
price
started
using
these
right
out
the
case,
luckily
they
come
precharged
0%
from
the
looks
of
it
so
far
can
say
sound
quality
it
awesome
for
for
the
price,
i've
used
other
bluetooth
earbuds
ranging
from
$0$0,
and
for
$0
the
quality
it
equivalent
to
the
higher
priced
headphones
out
there
had
no
issues
pairing,
once
the
blue
and
red
replicating
light
lights
up,
simply
pair
and
that
it
been
using
them
for
about
hours
and
with
still
some
more
juice
for
bit
more
you
can't
complain
for
the
price
and
quality,
i'm
definitely
sold
on
this
set
of
earbuds
after
the
first
charge
they
were
great
listen
to
audio
books
and
podcasts
all
day,
and
one
charge
would
last
little
over
half
the
day
now
have
to
switch
earbuds
at
least
twice
day
because
the
battery
won
last
after
couple
days
the
battery
life
went
to
only
hour
day
they
lasted
now
with
them
being
year
old,
am
throwing
them
away
going
to
order
different
brand
next
delivered
on
time
and
as
advertised
charging
in
the
case
is
excellent
was
able
to
recharge
headphones
times
over
before
we
had
to
recharge
the
case
overall
good
product
in
my
book
this
product
was
much
better
than
expected
given
the
price
point
of
this
product
these
headphones
are
perfect
for
anyone
who
is
looking
for
set
of
wireless
headphones
for
the
gym
these
headphones
stay
in
the
entire
time
i'm
running
and
they
never
cut
out
the
battery
life
is
very
good
and
easily
last
through
an
entire
0hour
workout
before
needing
to
be
recharged
can
say
this
enough
that
am
happy
with
this
product
returned
these
after
days
was
severely
unimpressed
with
the
sound
quality
little/no
bass
quality
at
all
as
compared
to
my
old
standard
headphones
that
came
with
my
phone
even
with
the
volume
turned
almost
all
the
way
up,
could
still
hear
outside
music
&
conversations
taking
place
that
was
day
one,
but
figured
maybe
i'd
just
get
used
to
it
then
on
my
second
day
of
use,
after
full
night
of
being
on
the
charger,
the
earbuds
died
about
hours
into
my
workout,
so
pretty
underwhelmed
by
most
everything
about
these
these
started
off
awesome
but
after
couple
weeks
of
use,
the
left
earbud
started
to
lose
volume
the
sound
quality
is
good,
covers
the
highs
and
lows
well
they
fit
comfortably
and
are
easy
to
use
they
connect
to
my
phone
quickly
and
are
easy
to
pair
with
other
devicesi
ve
tried
to
reset
the
buds
few
times
to
fix
the
volume
issue
with
the
left
bud,
and
it
perfectly
clean,
so
not
sure
what
the
issue
could
be
purchased
these
last
year
and
was
quite
happy
with
their
performance
until
the
right
ear
bud
stopped
charging
properly
fiddled
with
it
for
few
minutes
making
sure
everything
was
clean
and
noticed
one
of
the
small
prongs
that
touch
the
copper
pad
on
the
ear
bud
was
loose
and
recesses
backwards
vs
engaging
the
port
this
is
absolutely
manufactures
defect,
so
would
avoid
this
item
came
in
good
packaging,
but
the
earbuds
where
very
quiet,
hurted
my
ears
due
to
weight
after
to
min
of
them
being
in
the
usb
charger
is
joke,
doesnt
charge
anything
please
dont
buy
these,
dollar
tree
earbuds
or
and
below
is
better
than
these
overpriced
pieces
of
trash
thanks
don't
write
lot
of
reviews,
but
purchased
these
with
the
intent
to
use
them
with
my
personal
and
work
cell
phones
have
noticed
when
on
call
the
0nd
phone
will
repeatedly
disconnect
and
reconnect,
making
it
hard
to
hear
the
person
on
the
other
end
of
the
line
also,
get
complaints
from
everyone
that
my
voice
is
muffled
and
not
able
to
be
understood
the
sound
quality
is
ok,
but
really
didn't
purchase
them
to
listen
to
music,
need
them
for
callsoverall,
if
you
are
purchasing
these
for
phone
calls,
strongly
recommend
you
find
different
product
if
you
just
want
them
for
music
then
they
are
probably
ok
good
headphones,
however
when
started
sweating
they
got
alittle
loose
and
made
me
worry
about
them
falling
out
also
hearing
the
"connecting
left
channel
right
channel
second
device
connected"
everytime
gets
alittle
annoying
still
great
and
love
how
you
can
charge
them
fast
and
so
many
times
with
the
case
what
great
set
of
ear
buds
for
the
price
my
kids
have
the
airpods
from
apple
and
theses
are
just
as
good
but
these
fit
my
ears
better
and
don
fall
out
love
them
i'm
impressed
have
three
sets
gym
locker,
backpack,
and
suv
not
sure
on
battery
life
as
don't
use
them
for
extended
periods
keep
battery
pack
hooked
up
to
the
one
in
the
locker
they
connect
every
time
and
stay
in
when
exercise
they
may
be
big
for
an
aficionado
but
for
the
price
think
they
are
great
have
had
these
for
little
over
year
and
the
battery
life
is
atrocious
can
only
use
them
for
max
hours,
they
fall
out
easily,
and
there
are
times
were
getting
them
to
connect
to
my
phone
is
tedious
and
frustrating
these
headphones
are
great
the
sound
is
amazing,
fits
comfortably
in
my
pocket
and
in
my
ears,
with
the
waterproofing
this
is
great
for
being
out
in
the
rain
or
intense
training,
and
my
favorite
part
is
can
charge
the
earbuds
and
my
phone
from
the
same
power
bank
earbudcase
will
be
more
than
happy
to
try
out
other
pasonomi
products
in
the
near
future
although
these
paired
to
my
phone
instantly
and
they
fit
well,
the
sound
quality
is
complete
crap
there
is
zero
bass
and
there
no
noise
cancellation
whatsoever
it
all
treble
for
$0,
expected
more
very
disappointed
it
seems
like
the
sound
quality
was
an
afterthought
with
these
the
apple
earbuds
that
come
with
the
iphone
are
way,
way
better
when
received
the
product
it
looked
like
it
had
been
opened
before
plus
the
left
ear
bud
was
already
charged
and
the
right
one
dead
may
work
out
for
some
but
not
me
iprefer
little
base
all
my
songs
were
so
high
pitch
could
only
listen
with
volume
way
down
ll
deal
with
the
cords
any
day
for
little
base
the
sound
quality
is
pretty
good
have
noticed
that
the
ear
pieces
themselves
seem
very
sensitive
and
unless
you
are
wearing
both
of
them
they
disconnect
if
you're
using
them
for
conversations
they're
also
pretty
comfortable
too
normally
have
issues
with
earbuds
like
these
because
they
fall
out
these
do
not
do
that
all
in
all,
they're
decent
for
the
price
you
pay
if
you're
expecting
bose
like
quality,
don't
these
aren't
bose
really
liked
these
when
first
got
them
but
now
can
get
them
to
pair
correctly
with
each
other
to
the
phone
end
up
with
just
one
working
at
time
tried
resetting
using
the
video
instructions
but
nothing
has
worked
so
far
the
company
was
very
good
about
responding
but
there
new
email
address
now
for
customer
service
so
hoping
they
respond
with
some
answer
bought
in
june
and
started
having
problems
in
october
functions,
sound
are
great
battery
life
is
good
for
working
out
but
only
lasts
as
long
as
its
listed
around
three
hours
the
docking
station
is
recharge
unit
and
does
not
take
long
to
recharge
waterproof
is
excellent,
dropped
one
in
the
toilet
fished
it
out
dried
it
off
and
worked
just
fineupdate:
earbuds
not
pairing
anymore
tried
manual
fix
and
nothing
contacted
pasonomi
waiting
for
fix
had
these
months
will
update
if
or
not
get
response
could
not
be
more
satisfied
with
these
earphones
from
the
start
pairing
the
earbuds
was
very
easy
it
was
also
very
simple
to
connect
them
to
bluetooth
as
for
the
sound
quality
was
pleasantly
surprised
the
sound
is
very
good
with
these
earbuds
also
like
how
you
can
control
the
volume,
skipping
songs,
pause/play,
take
calls,
etc
from
the
earbuds
earbuds
last
for
about
hours
before
charging
is
needed
overall
very
satisfied
these
are
smaller
in
design
so
do
have
some
connectivity/interference
issues
if
you
have
your
phone
in
your
pocket
and
are
active,
these
might
go
in
and
out
if
you
keep
the
phone
still,
these
seem
to
work
better
purchased
this
set
of
buds
because
it
claimed
to
last
hrs
on
charge,
instead
you're
lucky
to
get
hrs
of
tunes
the
bluetooth
function
is
poor,
constantly
has
to
reconnect,
the
charging
is
slow
and
the
carrier
does
not
recharge
them
if
not
plugged
in
the
largest
pad
for
the
ear
is
not
large
enough
for
large
ears,
buds
fall
out
easily
and
are
very
sensitive
to
touch,
even
when
you're
not
touching
the
actual
area
if
could
get
refund,
would
the
sound
and
performance
of
the
headset
was
crisp
and
balanced,
pairing
was
simple,
they
did
the
work
on
their
own
it
took
day
or
so
to
get
comfortable
with
the
buttonless
touch
features,
but
after
learning,
it
was
simple
and
provided
clean
interface
they
fit
well,
but
removed
star
from
workout
because
they
could
fall
out
under
heavy
activity
running
smooth
surface
fine,
but
sudden
stop
or
heavy
jolt
could
knock
them
out
great
for
commuting
i've
expected
to
get
much
more
quality
product
after
reading
the

here
are
the

line:
i'm
pretty
disappointed
with
the
purchase
music
cutting
out
multiple
times
is
no
go
for
me
love
these
headphones
the
quality
of
this
product
and
for
the
price
you
can
buy
it
at
is
amazing
very
snug
fit
in
ear,
which
is
good
for
running,
lifting,
or
whatever
type
of
workout
you
want
to
do
also
good
for
just
daily
use
for
music
listening
at
home
or
work
sound
quality,
bass
and
noise
canceling
are
great
glad
didn
let
my
skepticism
get
the
better
of
me
with
this
purchase
you
should
definitely
buy
these
if
your
looking
for
some
good
wireless
headphones
for
low
price
definitely
well
worth
what
paid
for
them
sound
quality
is
absolutely
amazing
comes
with
several
different
ear
pieces
to
adjust
to
your
comfort
which
is
awesome
and
the
fact
that
you
can
use
one
or
two
at
time
or
one
with
two
separate
pieces
have
equipment
is
amazing
and
if
that's
not
good
enough
it's
also
portable
charging
station
for
your
phone
highly
recommend
these
ear
buds
are
great,
they
are
such
an
upgrade
to
any
wired
earbuds
everpros:
they
are
sleek
and
unnoticed
in
your
earthey
are
very
waterproof,
enough
for
heavy
rain
all
though
the
touch
controls
might
get
messed
up
littlethe
case
recharges
these
so
much
it
can
last
over
day
vacation
without
charging
the
caseyou
can
use
each
one
independently
from
the
other,
so
if
you
need
constant
use
just
switch
it
out
when
one
diesthey
sound
great,
i'm
no
audiophile
but
these
are
by
far
the
best
sounding
earbuds
i've
ever
hadthe
customer
support
is
very
good,
if
you
have
any
problem
they
will
do
their
absolute
best
to
help
youconsthe
case
is
very
bulky,
hard
to
carry
in
your
pocketeach
earbud
only
lasts
about
hours
exactly
what
was
looking
for
great
for
any
exercise,
yard
work,
or
while
you
sleep
using
single
feature
great
quality
audio,
plenty
loud,
and
way
to
good
out
canceling
outside
noise
best
of
all,
they
re
stupid
cheap
knowing
how
great
these
headphones
are,
would
easily
pay
double
the
price
really
wanted
to
find
good
pair
of
wireless
earbuds,
these
are
not
it
they
fit
really
well,
the
charging
case
is
awesome
the
sound
quality
is
rubbish,
no
bass
and
everything
sounds
really
high
pitched
the
worst
part
is
getting
the
buds
to
play
in
stereo,
you
have
go
through
this
step
process
that
only
works
about
0%
of
the
time
so
each
time
want
to
run
spend
my
entire
workout
time
trying
to
get
the
farkin
things
to
work
in
stereo
usually
give
up
and
just
listen
to
mono
there
are
much
better
products
out
there
would
not
recommend
them
plus
the
directions
etc
are
all
in
chinese
where
these
things
should
stay
it
all
up
to
you
guys
believe
me
or
not
this
product
won
last
any
longer
so
it
better
don
waste
your
time
and
money
bought
them
couple
week
ago
first
week
was
ok
second
week
right
side
earbud
sound
was
lower
than
left
and
some
time
while
listening
to
music
randomly
weird
noises
experience
not
worth
it
for
the
price
and
time
the
reviews
read
raved
about
this
product
while
the
sound
quality
is
great,
experienced
more
issues
than
what
wanted
on
full
battery
life,
the
right
bud
connected
only
part
of
the
time
while
working
in
my
garden,
could
only
be
away
from
my
phone
feet
in
order
for
the
buds
to
stay
connected
and
not
break
in
and
out
during
the
music
or
show
also,
the
battery
life
sucks
on
full
charge,
they
only
lasted
about
an
hour
to
an
hour
and
half
bought
these
specific
for
cycling,
but
think
will
keep
with
my
other
wireless
nontrue
wireless
headphones
they
last
longer
and
stay
connected
at
further
distance
than
theseterribly
disappointed
so
bought
my
first
pair
and
had
them
for
two
days
before
the
set
started
disconnecting
and
reconnecting
repeatedly
called
amazon
and
they
sent
me
replacement
this
set
lasted
about
days
before
they
started
doing
the
exact
same
thing
it
not
my
phone
cause
have
other
bluetooth
devices
ve
used
in
the
past
and
currently
using
another
due
the
the
item
above
not
working
correctly
don
regret
most
purchases
but
these
were
not
the
product
that
was
expecting
used
these
for
just
over
two
weeks,
and
during
that
time,
was
happy
with
my
purchase
they
weren't
uncomfortable
to
wear
and
sounded
fine
for
listening
to
musicbut
then
the
right
ear
bud
stopped
working
as
result,
am
now
in
the
process
of
returning
them
love
that
these
buds
sync
immediately
after
you
remove
them
from
their
charging
case
sometimes
only
want
to
use
one
at
time,
so
just
remove
both
and
set
one
off
to
the
side
the
waterproof
nature
of
them
is
great
they
fit
snug
and
never
feel
like
they
are
going
to
fall
out
my
son
is
jealous
and
keeps
trying
to
claim
them
as
his
as
soon
as
he
can
save
up
i'm
sure
he'll
buy
his
own
pair
there
is
only
one
flaw
in
my
opinion
wish
that
the
charging
cord
fit
inside
the
charging
case,
but
still
give
them
stars
holy
crap
these
things
have
terrible
sound
they
are
so
full
on
treble
it
hurts
my
ears
to
listen
to
anything
on
them
they
re
okay
comfort
wise,
and
pretty
easy
to
set
up,
but
if
you
want
any
amount
of
bass,
do
not
look
here
had
two
major
problems
with
these
headphones
do
not
recommend
them0
the
sound
went
to
almost
nothing
in
my
right
earbud
after
~
month
of
use
have
no
idea
what
happened
but
now
it's
unusable0
the
bluetooth
connection
was
unreliable
every
days
or
so
the
earbud
pair
would
disconnect
from
one
another,
and
would
have
to
go
through
an
annoying
process
of
getting
everything
back
in
sync
i've
been
wanting
decent
bluetooth
system
for
gym
workouts
and
finally
found
itthese
earbuds
came
quickly
and
were
packaged
well
they
fit
perfectly
in
my
ear,
are
very
comfortable,
and
don't
need
constant
readjusting
they
charge
quickly
and
have
decent
battery
life
highly
recommend
these
absolutely
loved
how
easy
it
was
to
connect
these
wireless
bluetooth
headphones
the
fit
great
and
have
clear
sound
the
only
volume
control
would
be
on
my
phone
which
sometimes
wish
could
go
louder
with
certain
songs
also
wish
the
headphones
had
more
bass
but
overall
enjoy
them
and
they
work
great
love
the
fit
of
these
better
than
ipods,
use
them
at
work,
one
side
at
time
so
that
the
other
is
charging
the
battery
life
is
maybe
to
hours,
so
using
one
side
at
time
allows
me
to
get
through
my
hour
shift
as
nurse
don't
like
carrying
the
case
around
everywhere
but
they
fit
my
ears
well
and
are
decent
air
pod
alternatives
am
worried
that
there
isn't
way
to
lock
them
from
other
people
connecting
to
them
though
been
having
headphone
for
months
they
are
noise
canceling
and
good
for
working
out
however
not
good
for
making
phone
calls
these
headphones
will
sound
stuffy
if
your
on
call
also
since
they
are
touch
pads
you
will
hang
up
on
people
for
just
barely
touching
the
headset
to
adjust
all
around
only
good
for
music
and
not
calls
love
these
things
sound
is
amazing
very
happy
whent
with
these
the
price
was
great
and
they
work
awsome
the
case
is
little
bulky
to
carry
around
but
it
will
charge
the
ear
buds
over
and
over
again
with
out
having
to
be
plugged
back
in
would
have
given
it
five
stars
overall
but
it
very
touchy
meaning
even
if
you
have
your
hand
brushes
up
against
the
unit
it
can
stop
or
change
channels
it
also
occasionally
drops
in
an
hour
but
overall
like
it
recently
purchased
the
product
and
will
make
sure
to
update
here
are
my
takeaways
so
farpros:i
like
the
touch
pad
capabilities
on
each
ear
bud
haven't
seen
it
as
hard
to
manage
as
others
have
saidstay
in
ears
during
workoutgreat
volume
and
noise
canceling
abilityblue
tooth
pairing
as
soon
as
you
remove
them
from
the
case
after
first
initial
pairingcons:case
is
little
thicker
than
expected
these
are
great
ve
tried
so
many
kinds
of
earbuds
and
none
really
have
fit,
or
offered
any
kind
of
sound
quality
these
do
both
they
paired
easily
and
work
very
well
super
pleased
if
there
was
anything
that
would
have
to
say
negative
is
wished
the
lifespan
of
the
battery
per
charge
would
be
longer
own
several
wireless
head
phones
costing
much
more
than
these
and
find
these
earbuds
far
superior
they
sync
automatically
and
quickly,
the
sound
quality
is
excellent
even
while
cycling,
they
stand
up
to
perspiration
and
the
customer
service
is
terrific
when
first
used
them
the
ear
tips
provided
permitted
the
bud
to
fall
out
of
one
ear
wrote
to
the
company
and
they
immediately
responded
saying
they
would
send
me
others
four
days
later
supply
of
alternative
tips
arrived
and
several
of
them
work
perfectly
highly
recommend
these
ear
buds
update:
reached
out
to
the
company
and
they're
replacing
the
right
ear
bud
even
though
was
out
of
the
year
warranty
excellent
customer
serviceamazing
volume
control
and
playback
features
however
after
less
than
year
the
left
ear
bud
stopped
working
have
contacted
pasonomi
for
replacement
pair
and
will
update
my
review
if
they
respond
the
volume
on
these
earbuds
when
got
them
were
great
but
now
when
connect
them
to
my
phone
they
often
are
not
loud
even
with
my
phone
at
max
volume,
have
tried
to
unpair
and
reconnect
them
and
restarted
my
phone
dont
know
why
it
does
it
now
no
way
to
adjust
volume
on
these
earbudsupdate:
the
seller
was
very
helpful
and
replaced
the
earbuds
and
now
they
work
perfectly
bought
these
earbuds
for
the
gym
because
my
headphone
jack
was
very
sensitive
and
would
often
stop
playing
music
because
of
movement
while
was
using
these,
the
music
over
the
speakers
on
the
gym
was
cancelled
out
at
about
half
of
max
volume
the
sound
quality
is
high
end,
and
makes
the
purchase
definitely
worth
have
had
these
earbuds
for
almost
week
now
and
have
yet
to
charge
them
although
have
used
them
almost
every
day
for
an
hour,
and
the
charging
case
is
still
above
0%
battery
had
to
return
because
the
bluetooth
connevtivity
is
not
the
best
although
this
may
not
be
the
case
for
everyone,
as
walked
around
my
college
campus,
thr
bluetooth
would
freak
out
if
went
under
any
trees
these
are
so
sleek
got
pair
of
skull
candy
wireless
buds,
and
they
stuck
pretty
far
out
of
my
ears
these
fit
firmly
and
tight
to
the
ear
very
comfortable
sound
is
great
as
well,
can't
believe
the
quality
well
worth
the
money,
will
be
returning
my
skull
candy
ones
these
were
half
the
price
wanted
to
like
these
things
but
over
time
ve
gone
to
almost
never
using
them
they
fit
and
sound
ok
but
the
short
battery
life
and
the
fact
that
they
never
*actually*
turn
off
in
the
charging
case
make
this
purchase
regret
find
that
when
they
are
stored
in
their
charging
case
my
phone
is
still
connecting
to
them
and
causes
confusion
when
trying
to
listen
to
something
on
my
phone,
take
call
or
use
another
bt
device
since
they
never
seem
to
turn
off
they
are
always
dead
whenever
actually
want
to
use
them
support
is
nonexistent
junk
unfortunately
they
do
not
last
more
than
hours
tried
everything
that
was
suggested
and
still
no
lucki
think
about
warranty
for
them
but
can
find
it
so
that
not
goodotherwise
like
them
just
wish
more
play
time
is
available
they
worked
fine
when
got
them
for
my
son
but
now
they
dont
work
properly
either
he
could
use
one
at
time
but
not
both
at
the
same
time
won't
recommend
have
used
these
few
times
and
just
put
them
to
the
running
on
the
treadmill
at
the
gym
test
and
am
very
happy
with
these,
so
far
for
the
lower
cost
wasn't
expecting
these
to
be
as
good
as
they
are
the
sound
quality
is
pretty
good
even
in
loud
planet
fitness
they
are
snug
too
and
handled
the
running
impact
with
no
problems
would
definitely
recommend
them
so
far
and
agree
with
the
overall
positive
reviews
that
led
me
to
buy
these
they
work
really
well,
once
you
have
them
in
they
cancel
out
noise
and
sound
quality
is
great,
you
dont
need
to
have
the
volume
up
very
loud
either
to
hear
the
wireless
controls
are
super
helpful
and
is
even
google
voice
enabled
then
the
battery
last
long
time
and
doubles
as
charger,
charges
my
phone
pretty
fast
but
sucks
out
the
juice
so
it
has
to
be
charged
to
use
after
using
for
phone
ive
had
these
for
solid
week
at
work
used
them
daily
for
hours+
they
have
decent
sound
and
fit
in
the
ear
nicely
ive
yet
to
run
them
out
of
power
though
do
put
them
back
in
the
case
while
not
in
use
only
complaints
have
thus
far
is
the
case
is
bit
large
though
it
does
charge
your
phone
if
you
like,
the
buds
are
bit
difficult
to
get
out
of
the
case
and
ear,
and
the
rubber
pieces
are
bit
cheap
would
recommend
this
product
due
to
its
quality
and
price
good
buy
had
to
send
first
set
back
because
of
some
type
rfi
noise
interference
that
occurred
during
some
calls
that
made
me
loose
my
call
and
have
to
turn
units
and
phone
to
rest
to
resume
my
call
never
write
reviews
for
things,
but
because
had
so
much
trouble
deciding
what
wireless
headphone
to
purchase
feel
like
need
to
share
my
opinion
was
dead
set
on
some
$0+
wireless
headphone
because
was
searching
for
some
that
actually
worked,
stayed
in
my
ears,
and
we
re
comfortable
after
reading
reviews,
decided
on
these
and
omg
you
get
such
quality
earbuds
that
are
great
for
exercising
highly
suggest
and
they
are
great
deal
considering
the
quality
and
price
point
definitely
not
disappointed
with
these
when
first
opened
up
the
package,
was
iffy
about
these
but
now
love
them
they
fit
in
my
ear
the
ear
pieces
have
different
size
ear
tips
they
pair
quickly
great
for
driving
hands
free
the
sound
quality
is
great
and
love
that
it
has
touch
activated
voice
command
after
months
of
using
these
earbuds
can
tell
that
they
last
and
they
well
made,
it
comes
with
case
that
charges
the
earbuds
on
the
go
just
keep
that
case
charged
had
these
head
phone
for
week
now
they
should
great
for
the
price
and
easy
to
set
up
very
comfortable
after
finding
my
size
ear
bud
to
use
the
only
disappointment
was
they
didn't
even
last
battery
when
used
them
for
half
marathon
fully
charged
they
state
there
hrs
long
but
they
died
at
hours
wear
these
at
work
the
battery
life
is
about
to
hours
the
charger
case
last
about
days
to
charge
them
the
distance
for
blue
booth
let's
me
go
through
two
office
walls
and
to
the
bathroom
it
cancels
out
almost
all
noise
love
them
originally
made
review
about
this
product
received
defective
pair
of
headphones
the
company
was
very
fast
and
accommodating
in
trying
to
resolve
the
problem
they
sent
new
pair
and
they
are
fantastic
good
quality,
good
fit,
would
definitely
recommend
to
buyers
only
problem
found
was
it
falls
out
of
your
ear
sometimes,
but
overall
great
product
the
pasonomi
x0
ear
buds
are
great
for
working
out
used
them
today
to
run
miles
and
didn
have
to
adjust
them
at
all
went
into
the
weight
room
after
running
and
only
heard
my
music
which
was
awesome
the
quality
of
sound
was
fantastic
as
well
love
the
charging
case
which
recharges
the
ear
buds
and
can
use
it
to
charge
my
phone
if
need
be
amazing
love
these
and
highly
recommend
them
one
thing
imwiikd
mention
is
to
read
the
instructions
because
there
isn
an
on/off
button,
and
you
don
want
to
fiddle
with
that
at
the
gym
like
did
they
worked
well
for
little
over
month
but
now
they
cut
in
and
out
for
no
reason
and
the
battery
doesn
even
last
hours
would
return
but
just
fell
out
the
return
window
was
gonna
purchase
another
apple
earbuds
since
one
of
the
buds
malfunction
saw
this
and
decided
to
give
it
try
since
white
was
never
my
color
and
this
is
so
much
more
affortable
tried
it
for
week
and
already
in
love
with
it
never
like
how
the
apple
earbuds
look
and
this
has
much
sleeker
design
cost
way
less
and
work
just
as
great
and
looks
much
much
better
when
is
on
great
voice
quality
as
well
was
looking
for
something
could
wear
while
sleeping
lay
on
my
side
and
these
are
the
first
ones
that
don
stick
out
too
far
the
sound
is
good
enough,
there
not
bose,
the
battery
does
bout
last
long
works
well
but
now
my
right
ear
bud
keep
malfunctioning
&
disconnecting
&
making
weird
buzzing
sound
before
it
disconnects
other
then
that
they
work
good
just
make
sure
you
get
different
type
of
ear
pieces
as
feel
the
stock
ones
don't
seal
very
well
enough
they
keep
breaking
the
ear
bud
looses
all
volume
before
the
base
battery
ran
out
they
sent
me
replcement
and
was
happy,
then
the
same
thing
happened,
one
earbud
lost
all
volume
repaired
with
the
old
set
to
get
two
working
earbuds
same
thing
happend
again
out
of
the
ear
buds
they
sent
me,
willnot
produce
any
sound
at
all
buyer
beware,
graeat
at
first,
then
repeaditly
brake
update:
sound
now
cuts
in
and
out
unexpectedly
from
the
left
earbud
every
time
use
it,
and
the
right
earbud
no
longer
works
at
all
each
use
the
left
earbud
has
lot
of
static
that
comes
through
and
no
music
for
minute
or
two
kinda
peeved
went
with
the
company
that
thought
would
have
good
product
support
and
would
replace
my
set
turns
out,
that
not
the
case
herelike
the
product
overall,
however
my
set
has
problem
with
the
right
earbud
connecting
to
the
charging
box
so
the
right
earbud
runs
out
of
battery
fairly
often
and
forced
to
put
them
away
really
like
this
earbud
set
works
well
with
my
iphone
sounds
clear
and
has
good
bass,
not
just
all
treble
it
also
came
in
nice
box
and
package,
which
i'm
thinking
of
getting
another
set
as
gift
for
my
brother's
upcoming
birthday
also
like
that
the
case
that
hold
them
are
portable
charging
device
for
the
earbuds
as
well
i've
had
these
earbuds
for
little
over
month
they
started
out
working
just
fine
and
felt
snug
on
my
ear
for
some
reason
the
volume
quality
dropped
and
the
sound
always
comes
in
very
low
now
at
first
the
sound
and
volume
were
perfect
i've
checked
all
my
settings
and
nothing
has
been
changed
since
first
used
them
use
it
during
some
workout
sessions
and
mountain
biking
rides
and
they
only
fell
out
once
replaced
the
inner
bud
with
larger
one
which
comes
provided
and
never
again
have
they
slipped
out
of
my
ear
so
when
got
this
product
was
amazed
how
small
and
compact
it
is
for
the
most
part
it
does
cancel
out
background
noise,
the
sound
quality
is
okay,
but
was
mostly
looking
for
investments
of
earbuds
cause
usually
end
up
breaking
my
wired
earbuds
with
few
months
they
fit
comfortable
in
my
ear,
and
it
does
have
good
battery
life
as
well
also
the
fact
that
the
case
is
also
portable
charger
is
definite
plus
as
well
all
in
all,
if
you
not
that
picky
with
sound
quality
then
these
are
definitely
worth
it
this
is
great
product
and
super
easy
to
use
the
case
is
compact
and
travel
friendly
particularly
liked
the
way
the
earbuds
fit
in
the
case
with
ease
as
it
has
some
magnetic
setup
to
fit
smoothly
earbuds
are
comfortable
in
the
ears
and
produce
high
quality
sound
it
connects
seemlessly
with
my
mobile
and
laptop
bluetooth
the
base
can
be
used
as
the
power
bank
and
can
charge
the
mobile
and
its
pretty
decent
toooverall
i'm
impressed
with
this
earbuds
and
had
to
buy
of
them
for
my
family
members
loved
these
so
much
they
were
amazing
for
about
month
of
heavy
use
then
suddenly
the
volume
wouldn't
get
as
loud,
they
don't
hold
charge
as
much,
don't
connect
automatically,
and
disconnect
randomly
i'm
so
sad
because
was
thrilled
finally
had
awesome
wireless
headphones
sending
them
back
and
the
search
continues
got
that
item
few
days
ago
it
is
easy
to
set
up
on
my
phone
and
laptop
and
test
them
and
then
they
worked
very
well
it
is
very
great
that
are
wireless
and
reasonably
priced
with
excellent
volume,
bass
and
treble,
and
ease
of
use
when
do
something
or
workout
am
so
happy
with
it
was
skeptical
about
ordering
these,
but
pleased
did
use
them
daily
on
the
treadmill
surprisingly
comfortable
and
lightweight
in
my
earsi
giving
this
product
stars
as
my
right
earbud
does
not
emit
sound
anymore
it
slowly
started
to
more
and
more
quiet
now
there
nothing
the
left
earbud
is
still
perfect
wish
would
ve
purchased
the
warranty
so
didn
have
to
buy
whole
new
set
will
likely
purchase
these
again
honestly
really
like
them,
did
really
like
them
alot,
and
then
day
later
boom
right
earbud
went
out,
volume
got
cut
in
half
and
it
sounded
horrible
emailed
them,
got
another
pair
boom
same
exact
thing
tried
to
email
them
again
either
for
another
pair
of
earphones
or
just
return
but
guess
what
they
havent
gotten
back
to
medefinitely
not
worth
spending
your
money
on
at
all
please
do
what
didnt
and
just
spend
bit
more
on
something
that
is
actually
worth
your
money
first
of
all,
it
was
designed
to
be
comfortable
to
wear
well
felt
it
can
just
stuck
right
in
my
ears
and
it
didn
hurt
second
the
quality
of
the
sound
is
pure
and
the
base
is
powerful
and
clear
this
one
is
nice
one
at
such
price
and
hope
the
quality
is
also
awesome
at
first
it
was
hard
for
me
to
figure
out
how
to
pair
it
after
the
first
time
pairing
no
issuei
love
how
clear
the
sound
is
on
call
the
bass
is
pretty
good
used
it
whole
day
doing
household
chores,
at
gym
the
ear
piece
stayed
in
place
love
this
one
better
than
name
brand
got
priced
right
too
actually
hated
but
than
got
awesome
help
from
technical
support
team,
they
went
way
beyond
and
sent
me
new
one
very
nice
just
received
mine
&
had
them
running
in
minutes
following
the
introductions
mind
you
ve
never
had
pair
or
wireless
earbuds
before
ever
sound
quality
is
great,
not
ton
of
bass
but
comparable
to
factory
settings
of
car
stereogood
enough
for
me
definitely
cancels
out
spins
around
me
&
love
not
dealing
with
cords
very
happy
thank
you
for
everyone
reviews,
that
why
purchased
these
also
very
happy
can
charge
my
phone
if
need
to
from
the
base
this
is
perfect
good
sound
quality
out
of
the
box
it
preinstalled
with
the
smallest
silicone
ear
tips,
first
thing
you
have
to
change
it
to
your
size
to
get
better
sound
quality
first
few
days
the
bluetooth
was
disconnected
between
left
and
right
ears
quite
often
but
it
rarely
happens
after
week
battery
life
is
good
after
charge
cycles
the
case
still
shows
light
out
the
only
thing
is
you
cannot
turn
it
off
unless
you
put
it
back
to
the
case
totally
satisfied
with
this
ear
buds
worked
great
up
until
it
didn
liked
that
could
use
them
separately
or
together
overall
good
buds
for
the
price
unfortunately
the
case
won
hold
charge
anymore
so
they
re
pain
using
them
now
worked
fine
for
couple
months,
than
randomly
the
soft
earbud
covering
came
off
on
one
piece
after
that
the
sound
quality
was
down,
it
didn't
fit
well,
and
was
uncomfortable
to
wear
there
is
no
way
to
get
replacement
will
not
buy
again
for
the
price
its
not
bad
for
bluetooth
earbuds
would
think
it
would
come
with
it's
own
charger
block
the
magnetic
charger
is
cool
concept
found
it
to
be
useful
since
my
charger
sits
on
the
end
table
some
times
knock
it
over
and
they
don't
come
out
completely
changed
my
music
listening
experience
no
cords,
and
works
perfectly
when
running
on
treadmill
or
riding
my
mountain
bike
my
first
experience
with
bluetooth
headphones
but
they
are
awesome
highly
recommend
this
product,
so
much
so
that
purchased
another
pair
for
my
wife
they
work
good
how
ever
have
to
reconnect
the
every
couple
of
days
they
pick
up
interfering
from
other
bluetooth
devices
there
is
no
way
to
change
channels
which
they
operate
on
battery
life
is
good
with
the
head
ear
buds
and
the
carrying
case
generally
need
to
charge
the
carrying
case
less
then
week
at
time
and
use
them
twice
day
for
an
hour
and
half
to
and
from
work
on
public
transportation
upon
quickly
receiving
these
wireless
buds,
put
them
in
immediate
loved
the
sound,
mic
quality,
and
audio
quality
however,
after
few
weeks
the
left
earbud
began
playing
at
significantly
lower
volume
it
disconnects
then
reconnects
after
seconds
with
no
audio
playing
the
sound
of
quality
of
this
product
is
pretty
amazing
must
say
noise
cancellation
aspect
wasn
bad
nor
was
it
super
amazing
but
feel
that
shouldn
take
away
from
this
product
at
all
this
product
is
great
when
hitting
the
gym
that
mainly
what
use
it
for
it
really
helps
that
it
fit
nicely
in
your
ear
,
battery
life
last
pretty
decent
and
and
that
the
charger
case
is
almost
like
battery
bank
/
charging
bank
very
affordable
price
,
great
product
,
high
usage
the
most
efficient
product
in
market
the
buds
work
pretty
well
the
quality
is
good
for
what
it
is
price
at
the
buds
fits
well
in
your
ear
and
like
how
it's
not
very
noticeable
connection
to
your
phone
is
easy
overall,
the
design
and
quality
is
good
the
pros:very
easy
to
use
right
out
of
the
box
didn't
need
to
bother
with
the
instruction
book
to
sync
them
to
my
phoneperfectly
secure
have
worn
them
while
running,
doing
yoga,
cleaning
around
the
house
with
no
problems
never
once
felt
the
need
to
adjust
themsound
quality
is
good
nice
clear
sound
with
my
music
on
full
blastthe
cons:as
far
as
can
tell,
there
is
no
way
to
disconnect
them
from
the
phone
without
going
to
phone
settings
or
by
putting
the
earbuds
back
in
the
case
not
huge
deal
but
would
it
be
nice
if
the
earbuds
had
button
to
disconnect
themi'm
happy
with
the
purchase
for
use
around
the
house
and
to
exercise,
these
will
be
perfect
durable
left
them
in
sauna
and
still
working
perfectly
fine
to
me
they're
just
regular
earphones
without
the
wires
very
good
sound
quality,
you
touch
the
buds
to
make
music
stop
or
start
and
can
use
them
to
activate
voice
search
or
google
assistant
also
the
buds
are
tiny
bit
magnetic
to
each
other
so
it's
easy
to
keep
them
together
package
comes
with
lot
of
instructions
and
carrying
pouch
very
nice
product
for
the
price
very
satisfied
love
my
earbuds
these
were
good
at
first
battery
life
hours
with
full
charge
you
can
use
only
the
left
one
by
its
self
the
left
one
has
the
mic
to
use
on
calls
ve
had
mine
one
year
and
now
it
going
down
hill
and
fast
the
charger
case
won
charge
anymore
and
the
left
earbud
won
connect
so
it
good
for
about
year
then
it
trash
bought
one
for
my
spouse
and
his
started
falling
apart
after
one
year
also
good
earbuds
for
the
price
bought
for
listening
to
audio
books
and
music,
and
they
sound
good
only
negative
found
is
with
phone
calls
maybe
i'm
just
using
them
wrong,
but
the
mic
never
picks
up
my
voice
unless
raise
my
voice
overall
would
highly
recommend
if
you
are
looking
for
reasonable
priced
earbuds
for
music/audiobook/podcast/etc
listening
affordable,
easy
to
setup,
and
quality
soundingreally
love
the
feature
of
tapping
headphones
to
switch
to
music
gotten
the
most
out
of
it
never
will
have
to
switch
music
from
my
phone
ever
it
charges
fast
and
don't
have
to
plug
it
to
charge
sometimes
since
the
case
for
them
has
its
own
charge
and
it
large
storage
for
from
the
looks
of
it,
have
never
fully
depleted
the
charging
casethese
headphones
are
great,
really
got
my
money's
worth,
would
recommend
to
anyone
these
are
great
wonderful
sound
quality
and
fit
perfectly
in
my
ear
without
falling
out
even
when
i'm
moving
around
the
only
downside
to
these
is
there's
slight
lag
when
i'm
trying
to
make
music
it
could
possibly
be
my
phone
lol
but
not
sure
other
than
that,
these
are
exactly
what
was
looking
for
had
an
issue
with
faulty
earbud
and
upon
posting
lessthanpraising
review,
customer
service
reached
out
to
me
directly
and
offered
not
only
completely
free
replacement,
but
also
$0
credit
back
to
my
card
new
replacement
works
great,
you
really
can
beat
the
price
for
the
quality
the
earbuds
seem
to
last
forever
without
charging
the
carrier
case
good
buy
this
product
was
pretty
good
for
about
week
then
after
that
the
problems
started
first
they
started
to
get
really
hot
when
charging
with
is
normal
with
most
electronics
but
these
got
extremely
hot
then
after
that
they
started
to
unpair
and
disconnect
from
my
phone
and
each
other
and
after
getting
them
to
pair
again
they
worked
for
about
week
then
it
started
again
and
now
they
cant
even
pair
to
anything
and
have
not
been
able
to
get
in
touch
with
someone
willing
to
help
all
of
the
support
has
been
have
you
tried
this
or
maybe
this
and
after
doing
all
those
things
could
not
get
them
to
replace
them
or
get
my
money
back
as
they
told
me
its
my
fault
they
broke
and
its
not
the
product
tried
lot
of
headphones
these
are
priced
right
and
very
good
for
music
in
the
gym
or
calls
in
the
car
what
is
most
important
to
me
was
the
customer
service
the
first
pair
ordered
were
good
for
about
month
then
lost
their
volume
on
calls
and
music
overall
wrote
them
and
we
troubleshooted
it
together
and
could
not
come
up
with
solution
they
sent
me
new
pair
free
of
charge
and
they
have
been
working
well
just
received
these
today
i'm
usually
big
spender
when
it
comes
to
music
but
decided
to
look
for
some
wireless
earbuds
that
are
good
quality
and
under
$0
came
across
these
and
after
reading
the
reviews
decided
to
purchase
them
so
far
they
fit
great
my
main
concern
was
that
they
would
fall
out
easily
but
they
fit
very
snuggly
even
head
banged
with
them
on
and
they
didn't
even
budge
the
sound
is
pretty
good
too
overall
am
happy
with
this
product
i'm
looking
forward
to
getting
lot
of
use
out
of
them
poor
design
and
weight
they
are
heavy
and
easily
fall
out
of
your
ears
they
don't
have
good
bass
response
the
iluv
earbuds
are
much
better
very
good
sound
comfortable
easy
to
pair
with
device
and
each
otheri
have
an
issue
where
the
earbuds
won't
disconnect
when
put
them
back
in
the
case,
so,
that's
problem
have
to
unpair
them
after
every
use
waste
of
money
product
looking
at
the
reviews,
don't
get
fooled
it
stopped
working
after
months
our
voice
will
never
be
audible
to
the
other
receiver
never
cpnencts
to
devices
properly
waste
of
money
very
easy
to
pair
with
phone,
and
stays
in
ear
nicely
i've
experienced
no
cut
out
in
my
music,
which
had
experienced
with
another
brand
of
similar
headphones
the
charging
station
is
the
coolest
great
alternative
to
the
iphone
ear
buds
these
cancel
out
the
background
noise
and
allow
you
to
focus
in
on
the
music
being
played
would
recommend
these
headphones
great
for
the
gym
too
as
they
don't
fall
out
of
the
ear
easily
usually
get
all
my
headphones
from
ross
for
way
cheap
and
thought
they
needed
an
upgrade
got
the
headphones
pretty
quickly
and
loved
them
set
up
took
me
seconds
to
do,
and
popped
those
babies
in
and
was
rocking
for
about
weeks
my
right
earbud
stopped
connecting,
so
contacted
their
customer
support
the
customer
support
team
doesn't
speak
english
too
well,
but
we
managed
after
weeks
of
emailing
to
figure
out
the
problem
and
they
sent
me
some
new
earphones
that
have
worked
perfectly
since
overall,
i'm
happy
with
the
purchase
this
product
is
not
worth
$0
have
bought
$0
headphones
that
are
better
than
thesepros:+easy
to
pair+they
don't
fall
off
when
i'm
runningcons:battery
only
last
about
0hrsbluetooth
connection
cuts
in
and
outthe
touch
buttons
are
so
sensitive
that
always
accidentally
pause
my
music
or
activate
google
assistantside
note:my
co
worker
has
the
exact
same
buds
but
they
are
different
brands
so
i'm
not
sure
what
the
deal
is
with
that
these
earbuds
exceeded
my
expectations
recently
started
running
days
week
and
friend
recommended
purchasing
wireless
earbuds
instead
of
my
wired
headphones
after
searching
online,
came
across
these
the
reviews
looked
great
so
decided
to
give
them
try
i'm
so
glad
did
they
are
light
weight
and
they
stay
firmly
in
my
earsi
was
shocked
was
sure
they
would
fall
outi
tried
to
make
them
fall
out,
lol
the
sound
quality
is
great
and
am
overall
pleased
with
my
purchase
you
wont
be
disappointed
came
with
rubber
inserts
for
all
ear
sizes
love
the
fit,
very
natural
feeling
and
no
need
to
keep
adjusting
love
them
these
earbuds
are
so
great,
and
setup
was
breeze
while
the
instructions
weren
perfect
english,
they
were
clear
enough
and
the
device
basically
handled
all
of
the
setup
for
me
ve
been
very
impressed
with
how
well
the
sound
comes
out,
how
these
are
completely
sound
proof,
and
the
long
lasting
battery
power
the
pack
is
great
case
to
keep
the
earbuds
safe
while
traveling,
and
love
the
magnetic
nature
so
the
earbuds
fit
perfectly
in
the
case
for
charging
fabulous
product
bought
these
as
gift
for
my
fiancee
he
is
carpenter
and
wears
headphones
all
day
aside
from
the
battery
life
he
loved
these
they
are
much
louder
than
his
old
pair
and
the
call
quality
is
really
good
he
likes
the
rechargeable
case
as
well
nice
little
guys
for
the
price
hope
they
hold
up
my
only
complaint
is
the
sound
quality
is
not
very
good
it
kind
of
sounds
like
you
re
listening
to
music
in
tin
can
purchased
these
to
watch
movies
on
tv
and
listen
to
music
really
loved
the
clarity
of
the
sound
that
comes
through
these
headphones
mostly
listen
to
rock
and
can
hear
the
powerful
noise
coming
through
iti
really
liked
thembest
feature
is
can
charge
my
phone
with
the
case
ordered
this
pair
and
had
fall
in
love
with
the
sound
qualityvery
cool
and
unique
looking
was
surprised
with
the
quality
and
how
much
it
works
for
noise
cancellation
highly
recommend
this
product
if
you
looking
for
good
quality
earbuds
for
the
reasonable
price
this
ear
buds
are
very
comfortable
for
gym
workouts
value
for
money
and
worth
actually
heard
about
these
from
friend
at
the
gym,
always
used
my
airpods
for
working
out
but
eventually
over
time
the
sweat
would
actually
mess
with
the
audio,
so
looked
into
bose
only
to
find
out
there
was
common
problem
with
the
left
earbud,
so
when
was
recommended
these
figured
why
not,
ve
used
them
for
month
now
and
love
them,
only
wish
battery
life
was
longer
but
to
compensate
for
that
the
case
is
very
fast
charging
which
love
overall
recommend
if
you
workout
these
are
great
easy
to
use
and
set
up,
noise
cancelling
quality
was
impressive
sound
quality
was
also
great
while
listen
to
music,
watching
netflix
and
just
sitting
down
relaxing
tried
them
at
the
gym
and
was
quite
impressed
they
stayed
in
my
ears
and
had
no
issues
overall
very
impressed
after
receiving
this
product
and
using
it
for
less
than
hours
sadly
regret
that
will
be
returning
it
today
did
extensive
research,
read
many
reviews
and
narrowed
it
down
to
these
works
great
for
media;
callers
cannot
hear
me
therefore
have
to
disconnect
bluetooth,
these
are
so
sensitive
that
i've
hung
up
on
just
about
every
person
am
very
pleased
with
the
ear
buds
they
were
super
easy
to
pair
with
my
android
samsung
galaxy
like
that
can
use
just
one
at
time
if
need
to
all
the
function
options
are
little
overwhelming
but
i'm
sure
once
get
use
to
them
it
will
be
easier
overallvery
happy
with
this
product
the
sound
quality
is
mediocre,
ve
gotten
better
sound
from
cheaper
bluetooths
however
the
case
is
really
nice,
battery
holds
long
charge,
and
the
ear
buds
do
not
pop
out
can
see
myself
using
these
past
months
though
have
gone
through
number
of
headphones,
this
product
is
the
best
one
ve
owned
so
far
can
control
it
to
play,
pause,
next
or
previous
song,
even
control
the
volume
moreover,
like
these
earbuds
because
they
stay
in
place
well
use
these
at
the
gym
and
when
walking
to/from
class
like
it
says,
rain
and
sweat
don't
affect
the
earpieces
or
case
at
all
they
work
reliably
and
sound
good
these
actually
seem
to
work
up
to
/
feet
away
which
is
awesome
bluetooth
connection
is
horrible
sounds
like
cd
skipping
sometimes,
or
the
left
or
right
ear
bud
drops
out
for
second
happens
way
too
often,
for
no
reason,
when
my
phone
is
right
in
my
pocket
does
it
with
my
ipod
also
sound
quality
is
good,
but
when
it's
all
choppy
it
ruins
it
and
is
very
frustrating
very
disappointed
with
the
quality
of
these
buds
sound
quality
very
poor
and
got
worse
with
ongoing
use
one
ear
bud
only
works
about
half
the
time
set
up
was
easy
but
overall
do
not
recommend
these
have
have
better
luck
with
cheaper
ones
not
worth
the
money
for
sure
love
them
they
do
take
couple
of
hours
to
fully
charge
but
worth
it
apple
airpods
are
too
big
for
my
ears
and
hurt
and
these
fit
perfectly
would
recommend
them
these
earbuds
are
top
notch,
especially
for
my
usage
have
tested
these
out
and
battery
last
me
days
on
light
usage
and
day
on
heavy
usage
also,
the
customer
service
is
great
first
pair
got
did
not
work
properly
and
after
emailing
them
got
second
pair
working
great
highly
recommend
these
if
you're
looking
for
wireless
earbuds
these
work
well
if
you're
using
it
for
working
out
not
so
much
if
your
using
it
for
hands
free
calls
that's
where
the
quality
lacks
can
hear
the
caller
fine
but
they
cant
hear
me
well,
everyone
says
sound
distant
still
keeping
them
since
they
work
great
for
music
or
audiobooks
during
workouts
use
these
for
running
and
also
for
watching
movies
on
airplanes
they
are
not
good
for
phone
calls,
but
wasn't
using
them
for
that
anyways
product
is
amazing,
i've
gone
through
different
types
of
earbuds
but
none
are
as
good
as
these
they
never
slip
or
fall
off
your
ear,
sound
quality
is
great
and
the
design
is
really
nice
and
clean
the
only
complaint
have
so
far
is
that
the
connectablility
of
the
device
can
be
iffy
at
times
but
for
the
majority
of
the
time
it
works
great
another
thing
is
that
could
be
tricky
to
first
set
them
up
but
you'll
get
the
hang
of
it
pretty
quick
overall
great
product
and
miles
better
than
others
have
tried
ve
done
tons
of
researches
ve
gone
to
best
buy
and
stuff
got
bose
soundsport
at
best
buy
the
fit
is
not
as
good
as
this
though
the
sound
for
bose
is
better
but
it
would
always
fall
when
working
out
ended
up
returning
them
and
went
with
this
worth
the
try
for
this
great
price
also
got
year
warranty
for
really
cheap
price
figure
it
won
go
wrong
with
that
the
is
very
good,
and
affordable
battery
long
lasting,
my
favorite
feature
is,
the
how
easy
it
is
to
connect
to
my
stuff
mark
you,
it
can
only
connect
to
device
at
time,
but
have
it
pair
to
my
laptop
and
phones
which
ever
device
am
using
just
turn
off
bt
on
the
other
and
bam
connect
no
issuecustomer
service
was
quick
and
good
for
me,
they

i've
been
using
mine
for
months,
and
i'm
happy
and
satisfied
with
it
like
the
fact
that
could
charge
it
whenever
need
to
the
sounds
are
not
bad
either
their
customer
assistance
is
quite
good,
by
experience
accidentally
dropped
mine
into
the
water
and
contact
them
immediately
since
can't
hear
the
sounds
anymore
but
then
it
worked
right
after
sent
the
message
yes,
it
did
worked
thank
goodness
then
received
their
reply
the
next
day
so
far,
don't
have
problem
using
it
these
earbuds
are
great
for
listening
to
music
and
everything
but
if
you
re
going
to
use
it
to
call
people,
it
ll
be
hard
for
them
to
hear
you
wanted
to
use
this
so
can
listen
and
call
but
can
use
it
because
the
person
on
the
line
can
hear
me
very
well
overall,
don
buy
it
if
you
want
to
use
these
for
answering
phone
calls
but
for
music
and
working
out,
recommend
it
arrived
today
and
the
packaging
is
excellent
so
far
the
charge
has
lasted
for
hrs
of
music
gave
star
on
sound
quality
because
prefer
my
music
little
louder
and
more
bass,
other
than
that
it
is
well
worth
the
money
very
nice
product
really
great
sound
quality
battery
life
on
the
earbuds
lasts
hours,
the
charging
case
battery
can
last
me
over
week,
possibly
even
weeks
great
product
for
the
price
comfortable,
easy
pairing,
nice
build
quality
but
just
like
all
the
other
earbuds
i've
triedeven
expensive
ones
like
the
jabra
0t,
if
it's
not
airpods,
the
sound
quality
is
tinny
and
hollow
these
may
be
great
for
listening
to
an
audible
book,
but
listening
to
music
is
underwhelming
have
to
say
that
was
okay
with
the
product
when
first
received
it
however,
the
sound
quality
is
normal,
no
bass
at
all
and
the
worse
thing
is
when
you
put
the
earbuds
in
the
box
and
carry
it
on
the
packet
the
earbuds
will
detach
from
the
box
and
automatically
connect
to
your
phone
and
it
is
quite
annoying
have
to
return
it
am
also
surprised
that
not
single
review
mention
this
problem
have
had
these
ear
buds
for
over
year
and
haven't
had
any
problems
the
sound
is
loud
and
prefer
it
over
any
other
earbuds
have
tried
do
wish
the
battery
life
was
longer,
but
oh
well
also
wish
there
was
one
bud
mode,
but
can't
complain
because
of
the
amazing
deal
this
product
offers
it's
affordable
and
an
overall
great
product
there's
not
ton
of
bass,
but
imagine
that
would
impact
battery
life
can
usually
get
about
hr
life
out
of
them,
which
works
well
for
before/after
lunch
but
sometimes
they
seem
to
drain
more
quickly
than
others
overall,
very
good
deal
for
the
price
my
kids
are
more
tech
savvy
than
mehowever,
was
easily
able
to
set
up
and
use
these
earbuds
and
love
them
more
long
runs
with
music
are
in
my
future
the
earbuds
were
comfortable
and
they
didn't
fall
out
upon
bouncing/bounding/shaking
my
head
they
stayed
charged
long
enough
for
long
run
still
able
to
hear
noise
around
me,
but
sound
quality
great
didn't
hurt
my
lobes
or
inner
ear
at
all
recommend
for
sure
beats
having
wires
during
workouts
happy
my
technology
usage
is
blossoming
had
no
problems
pairing
my
earbuds
to
my
phone
and
every
time
take
out
of
the
charging
case
it
automatically
connects
love
the
sound
quality
of
the
earbuds
also
love
the
fit
of
the
earbuds
also
fits
very
snug
into
my
ear
and
never
falls
out
or
feels
loose
the
battery
life
is
very
descent
and
last
nice
long
time
then
put
one
back
in
charger
and
take
the
other
out
and
use
it
while
the
dead
ones
charge
overall
very
satisfied
with
the
purchase
of
these
earbuds
the
headphones
fit
in
your
ear
great
and
setup
is
easy
if
you
like
sound
quality
when
listening
to
music
then
these
are
not
for
you
the
sound
is
horrible
no
bass
what
so
ever,
it
almost
makes
the
music
sound
weird
there
is
so
much
treble
it
almost
hurts
your
ears
if
you
turn
them
up
louder
the
ear
buds
fit
nicely
usually
only
use
one
at
time
and
was
thinking
that
they
could
be
used
individually
the
left
bud
is
master
and
has
about
0hr
life
but
as
bonus
can
charge
my
phone
with
the
the
usb
port
should
have
done
more
research
still
working
really
liked
these
earbuds
when
got
them
back
in
november
it
is
now
april
used
them
or
twice
week
would
get
good
run
in
now
the
battery
is
dying
after
minute
phone
call
have
requested
an
exchange
w/
the
seller
hope
they
stand
behind
their
product
they
paired
immediately
and
perform
well
clear
soundi
use
them
daily
and
need
to
charge
the
case
about
every
days
pods
run
for
hours
or
more
before
they
require
recharge
via
the
case
these
little
guys
are
pretty
amazing
haven't
done
hard
workout
in
them
yet,
so
can't
speak
to
their
ability
to
stay
in
then,
but
based
on
their
general
hold
during
normal
use
even
with
vigorous
head
turns
and
whatnot,
they
stay
in
well
my
only
complaint
is
the
battery
life,
which
really
is
to
be
expected
from
something
as
tiny
as
they
are,
you
get
couple
hours
then
need
quick
recharge
very
clever
design
overall
sound
quality
is
really
good,
until
you
try
phone
call
for
whatever
reason,
phone
calls
are
terrible
in
quality
on
your
side
but
the
mic
is
good
as
whoever
i'm
talking
to
can
hear
me
fine
weird
shape
but
you
get
used
to
it
dont
buy
if
you
have
small
ears
or
you
have
trouble
with
normal
ear
buds
already
like
the
feel
in
my
ears,
usually
anything
inside
my
ear
is
uncomfortable
but
these
ear
buds
feel
great
they
are
durable
and
easy
to
connect,
even
for
gramma
with
no
experience
opened
the
box,
turned
on
my
bluetooth
and
voila
music
no
wires
is
awesome
battery
life
is
at
minimum
what
they
say
it
should
be,
maybe
longer
tend
alternate
them,
when
one
starts
dying
just
put
it
away
and
pull
the
other
out
sound
is
good,
comfortable,
not
very
noticeable
too
one
thing
wish
they
were
better
at
is
blocking
out
sound
it's
not
bad
but
could
be
better
because
they
dont
get
in
there
like
other
earbuds
i'm
very
satisfied
with
these
love
these
headphones
they
come
in
really
swanky
packaging,
great
for
gifting
the
instructions
are
in
broken
english
so
was
little
concerned,
but
no
worries
the
headphones
practically
set
themselves
up
and
are
so
easy
even
technologically
challenged
person
like
me
could
do
it
they
come
with
different
size
ear
pieces
to
customize
and
the
sound
is
fabulous
looking
forward
to
enjoying
these
for
long
time
these
earphones
are
great
good
buy
if
you're
looking
for
wireless
earphones
for
the
gym,
running,
ect
for
sure
my
favorite
bluetooth
earphones
to
date
they
fit
and
stay
in
the
ear
perfectly
really
like
the
case
these
earphones
come
in,
it's
small
and
portable
and
charges
the
earphones
which
is
awesome
because
my
last
pair
of
bluetooth
earphones
would
constantly
die
mid
workout
because
forgot
to
put
them
on
charge
the
day
before
would
for
sure
recommend
these
kudos
to
amazon
for
super
fast
delivery
the
product
itself
is
actually
really
good
the
battery
lasts
long
time
and
it
comes
with
little
charging
case
good
sound
listen
to
podcasts
so
don
need
anything
fancy
like
bose
headphones
like
it
is
all
:
it
has
satisfying
sound
quality
and
playback
time
comparing
to
my
previous
apple
airpod,
it
is
huge
bonus
don't
have
to
charge
it
often
and
much
cheaper
however,
not
as
good
quality
material
as
airpod
the
ear
buds
are
supposedly
supposed
to
turn
off
automatically
when
they're
placed
in
the
charger
mine
did
not
they
kept
trying
to
pair
with
my
phone
making
it
impossible
to
connect
to
any
other
device
even
selecting
"forget
this
device"
did
not
work
after
dealing
with
the
issue
all
day
threw
them
against
the
wall
in
fit
of
anger
to
their
credit,
they
still
worked
unfortunately
my
tantrum
did
not
fix
the
problem,
but
hammer
did
wife
raves
about
these
so
gift
success
her
only
issue
is
she
has
found
no
way
to
volume
up
so
far
she
says
these
are
the
best
ones
yet
and
we
have
tried
lot
so
good
bought
another
set
for
my
mother
these
are
great
they
bluetooth
immediately,
stay
charged,
have
great
sound,
and
don't
fall
out
while
run
can
use
one
or
two,
and
the
charger
box
is
really
nice
also
excellent
customer
service
i'm
ordering
more
for
friends
and
gifts
decent
headphone
quality
that
last
less
then
months
but
save
your
money
and
buy
different
pair
months
in
the
right
bud
was
only
at
about
0%
volume
and
less
then
months
the
headphones
no
longer
charge
and
are
useless
received
my
pasonami
bluetooth
earbuds
yesterday,
and
love
them
used
them
all
night
last
night
and
all
morning
this
morning,
and
they're
great
sound
quality
is
phenomenal,
and
the
touch
control
is
easy
to
use
couldn't
be
happier
these
simply
aren
ipx0
headphones
ve
gone
through
pairs
in
months
due
to
an
earbud
cutting
out
they
aren
waterproof
after
the
second
pair
going
to
have
to
try
something
different
the
first
pair
got
were
great
for
about
month
then
the
right
earbud
would
only
reach
about
0%
volume
the
second
pair
out
of
the
box
were
cutting
out
and
constantly
disconnecting,
have
them
shot
regardless
and
ran
into
the
exact
same
issue
if
you
don
use
them
with
water
sure
they
re
fine
but
they
re
simply
not
waterproof
headphones
brought
these
earbuds
nearly
week
after
losing
the
charging
case
for
my
older
ones
compared
to
the
other
one
had,
this
was
dissapointing
the
maximum
volume
is
half
that
of
regular
earphones
unlike
$0
airpods
and
the
ones
had,
this
didn't
cost
hundreds
of
dollars,
and
surprisingly,
didnt
take
too
much
to
connect
those
were
the
good
qualities
but
loathe
these
earbuds
for
its
sound
quality
and
volume
however,
will
still
use
this
as
portable
charger
they
fit
nicely
in
your
ears
and
stay
there
the
sound
quality
is
good
free
front
wires
at
last
liked
these
lot
at
first
they
worked
very
well
for
workouts
and
running,
etc
but
after
about
month,
the
left
earbud
stopped
working
:
no
sound
issued
from
it
though
could
tell
from
the
light
that
it
was
charged
and
turned
on
contacted
pasonomi
and
they
were
helpful
and
ultimately
replaced
the
unit
it
is
now
little
over
three
months
with
the
new
unit
and
the
same
problem
just
happened
again
am
very
frustrated
and
would
no
longer
recommend
this
product
bought
these
as
gift
for
my
husband
and
was
very
disappointed
to
have
to
return
them
because
the
right
ear
bud
will
not
charge
and
won
work
the
case
was
nice
and
the
left
one
worked
ok
he
did
mention
that
the
sound
would
crackle
as
if
the
connectivity
was
weak
he
also
stated
that
he
wished
it
had
more
base
but
did
fit
in
the
ear
well
i've
had
these
earbuds
for
week
or
so
and
am
returning
them
todaythey
produce
decent
sound,
but
the
battery
life
is
horrible;
have
to
charge
them
every
two
hours
they
easily
fall
out
of
your
ears
and
they
have
sound
or
connectivity
issues
at
times;
at
times
they
sound
like
very
old
choppy
drive
through
speakernever
really
figured
out
the
"touch"
operation
on
them
either,
sometimes
you
tap
the
earbud
and
the
music
stops
playing,
other
times
it
turns
on
"bixby/siri"
don't
waste
your
$0
buying
these
poorly
made
earbudsi'm
going
to
try
pair
that
costs
under
$0wish
me
luck
these
headphones
do
not
work
together
and
when
finally
do
get
him
to
pair
together
they
only
work
for
about
seconds
and
it
gets
all
staticky
and
then
they
both
just
turn
off
and
my
phone
shows
that
it's
playing
the
video
or
the
song
but
no
noise
comes
through
the
head
phones
the
only
one
can
use
successfully
is
the
right
ear
bud
and
the
left
ear
bud
does
not
work
at
all
unfortunately
kept
these
too
long
and
the
refund
policy
is
only
like
days
which
in
my
opinion
should
be
longer
at
least
days
am
very
unhappy
with
these
please
please
do
not
buy
these
earbuds
should
have
known
since
they
are
from
china
feel
cheated
know
few
people
who
have
been
able
to
find
bluetooth
headphones
for
cheaper
than
these,
but
honestly,
none
of
them
measure
up
to
the
sound
quality,
durability,
and
battery
life
of
these
highly
recommend,
this
is
not
an
item
you
want
to
save
on
they
work
with
my
phone,
my
laptop,
my
tablet,
and
their
range
is
very
impressive;
i'd
say
about
ft
i'm
never
going
back
to
wired
headphones
again
excellent
value
earbuds
really
liked
the
earbud
design
as
they
fit
well
into
my
ears
haven't
had
any
issues
with
them
falling
out
unlike
traditional
ear
headphones
these
earbuds
have
quality
acoustic
sound
and
are
plenty
loud
they
were
easy
to
link
up
to
my
phone
and
came
in
nice
protective
charging
case
i'm
very
happy
overall
and
the
battery
lasts
several
hours
overall
great
quality
for
reasonable
price**
hint
at
first
couldn't
open
case
but
realize
its
easier
to
open
from
the
sides
love
the
ear
buds
comfortable
and
work
perfect
for
working
out
and
cycling
they
sound
really
good
too
you
can
also
mess
with
the
settings
on
your
phone
to
adjust
the
sound
bought
these
with
high
hopes
due
reviews
but
unfortunately
right
earbud
went
out
within
weeks
of
usage
an
alternative
reason
purchased
was
to
charge
phone,
but
that
too
is
ineffectivei
still
wear
left
earbud
but
after
min
it
tickles/itches
my
ear
&
need
breakcompany
will

after
leaving

recommended
these
are
amazing
am
dog
groomer,
so
use
these
while
am
drying
pups,
and
the
noise
canceling
is
amazing
the
volume
goes
very
high,
which
is
fantastic
to
drown
out
the
noise
of
the

the
battery
life
is
fine
for
me,
it
lasts
about
hours,
give
or
take
with
no

don't

this

very
good
product
for

great

very
simple
to

compared
to
other
wireless
earbuds
have
bought
use
them
in
the
gym
everyday
and
always
stay
in
place
which
is
great
the
case
is
great
feature,
where
it
keeps
the
headphones
always
charged,
and
rarely
has
to
get
charged
it

had
to

since
got
it
the
headphones
also
last
multiple
hours
so
the
battery
life
is
also
very
good
on
those
purchased
in
february
it
now
may,
the
left
ear
speaker
is
failing
volume
is
very
low
compared
to
the
right
speaker
when
fully
charged
for
all
the
good
reviews
thought
they
would
have
lasted
longer,
not
satisfied
with
this
product,
would
not
recommend
been
using
these
daily
for
months
they
are
so
comfortable
often
forget
they
are
still
in
i've
dropped
the
case
several
times
and
still
no
issue
at
all
with
charging
also
the
range
on
the
earbud
from
the
bluetooth
device
it's
connected
to
is
quite
impressive
often
leave
my
phone
charging
on
the
counter
and
walk
all
over
my
appartment
with
no
interruption
in
the
signal
bought
this
product
for
my
son
who
enjoys
playing
games
on
his
laptop
and
prefer
not
to
hear
his
sound
blasting
from
the
laptop
he
said
that
most
of
the
time
they
work
decently
however,
once
in
while,
only
one
earbud
would
work
am
not
sure
if
this
is
due
to
the
connectivity
or
the
actual
mechanics
he
seems
to
prefer
it
over
the
traditionally
large
earphones
he's
also
smaller
child
and
did
mention
that
sometimes
the
earbuds
fall
out
even
with
the
smallest
ear
cover
overall,
good
buy
for
wireless
earphones
if
someone
cannot
afford
to
buy
airpods
they
started
off
as
great
headphones
but
figured
it
was
too
good
to
be
true
writing
this
review
months
later
used
these
for
work
lot
but
after
while
noticed
the
sound
quality
wasn
there
and
the
bass
was
starting
to
go
the
next
and
final
thing
was
the
battery
life,
it
went
from
hours
to
and
would
barely
charge
my
phone
with
its
battery
back,
completely
disappointed
in
my
investment
at
best,
for
me
was
hours
of
play
time
on
single
full
charge
also
at
slightly
less
that
year
of
ownership
one
of
the
two
electrical
contact
for
charging
the
right
bud
had
become
depressed
enough
that
it
would
not
charge
when
the
right
bud
was
placed
into
the
case
to
be
charged
so
be
cautious
when
installing
them
to
charge
should
it
not
flash
red
then
there
is
problem
with
the
contacts
or
the
charger
itself
need
to
be
charged
use
these
when
go
tanning
it
is
stand
up
bed
so
have
to
have
wireless
earbuds
the
sound
is
very
clear
and
my
battery
still
hasn't
died
on
them
they
are
very
comfortable
in
my
ear
and
paired
easily
with
my
phone
they
have
saved
me
from
boredom
and
singing
to
myself
while
tanning
have
used
these
for
about
months
and
just
recently
started
having
issues
the
right
side
stopped
working
but
it
seems
to
be
problem
with
the
left
and
right
side
connecting
to
each
other
because
it
still
charges
and
lights
up
so
it's
not
completely
broken
i've
tried
repairing
them
with
my
phone
and
few
other
tricks
read
in
reviews
online
but
nothing
helped
all
in
all
they're
not
bad
headphones
the
sound
is
pretty
decent
and
they're
comfortable
to
wear
for
couple
hours
had
no
problems
with
them
until
the
connection
issue
just
unfortunate
that
they
didn't
last
very
long
they
work
good,
only
thing
don't
like/understand
is
that
once
paired,
if
you
pause
your
media,
they
disconnect
within
minute
or
two,
only
to
immediately
reconnect,
then
disconnect
minute
or
two
later
voice
announces
this
each
time
this
continues
until
you
press
play
again
it's
not
too
annoying
but
it
is
little
bit
great
product
they
work
amazing
well
you
can
walk
away
from
your
phone
at
least
feet
without
interruption
fits
perfectly
in
your
ear
without
falling
out
bluetooth
ready
would
recommend
these
to
anyone
looking
for
small
set
of
wireless
headphones
use
this
headphone
while
doing
several
exercises
walking,
hiking
etc
and
at
home
while
working
the
sound
is
great
is
stays
in
your
ear
without
any
problem
has
several
options
to
match
your
ear
and
does
excellent
job
in
canceling
noises
phone
calls
also
works
great
both
ways
highly
recommended
like
this
earbuds
for
listening
to
music
and
that's
about
it
tbh
bought
them
for
calls
on
discord
discreetly
and
to
listen
to
music
while
workout
they
have
difficulty
connecting
and
drops
calls
sometimes
the
voice
quality
is
awful
barely
picks
up
bass
for
music
but
has
been
helpful
to
listen
to
music
on
the
train
and
working
out
don't
stay
charged,
cant
have
just
one
earbud
in
you
have
to
wear
both,
and
the
touch
features
are
off
waste
of
money
liked
how
effective
the
noise
cancellation
is
very
noticable
the
quality
is
excellent
the
battery
life
can
be
improved,
but
its
not
the
worst
the
biggest
complaint
have
about
this
is
the
fact
the
right
side
is
now
for
some
reason
incredibly
quiet
like,
barely
any
sound
can
be
heard,
and
when
can
hear
from
the
side,
the
quality
isnt
the
best
besides
that,
it's
still
excellent
choice
for
anyone
looking
for
wireless
earbuds
love
this
truly
wireless
bluetooth
earbuds
they
connect
flawlessly
to
my
phone
as
soon
as
they
are
pulled
from
the
charging
case
the
case
keeps
the
buds
constantly
"topped
off"
so
do
not
have
any
downtime
when
using
them
sporadically
throughout
the
day
had
an
initial
issue
with
the
build
of
one
of
the
earbuds,
but
contacted
the
seller
and
they
replaced
them
immediately
great
customer
service
for
this
price,
it's
pretty
great
bought
these
to
replace
my
missing
jabras
and
am
pleasantly
surprised
by
them
the
sound
is
very
similar,
the
battery
life
surpasses
the
jabra,
and
id
say
the
only
noticeable
difference
is
the
fit
for
nearly
dollars
less
i'm
very
willing
to
overlook
it
it's
not
as
snug
as
some
of
its
more
expensive
competitors
but
some
may
think
that
pro
rather
than
con
didn't
think
i'd
find
anything
affordable
with
decent
quality
but
this
comfortably
met
all
my
criteria
am
somewhat
not
happy
with
the
earbuds
bought
these
in
may
and
the
right
earbud
stop
working
and
will
not
hold
charge
have
had
not
success
with
getting
in
contact
with
the
company
to
return
them
or
replace
them
read
tons
of
reviews
of
different
wireless
earbuds
the
highest
rates
were
all
well
over
$0
saw
these
and
figured
would
try
them
out
they
re
amazing
was
pleasantly
surprised
the
only
thing
will
say
is
have
tragus
piercing
that
doesn
allow
the
earbud
to
sit
right
in
my
ear
sometimes
and
it
doesn
allow
for
full
noise
cancelling
but
it
not
big
deal
to
me
just
something
to
be
aware
of
if
you
have
his
piercing
these
are
decent
ear
buds,
especially
for
the
price
did
have
some
issues
with
off
balance
volume,
but
the
issues
were
quickly
resolved
with
the
help
of
pasonomi
customer
service
the
sound
is
good
with
these
ear
buds
and
fairly
simple
operation
my
only
complaint
is
the
battery
life
they
run
out
of
power
at
0/0
hours
all
in
all,
good
purchase
the
only
negative
have
is
that
the
battery
life
is
just
little
shorter
that
the
description
says
however,
for
the
price
and
quality
of
the
sound
would
definitely
purchase
these
again
ve
really
enjoyed
this
product
it
been
very
reliable
and
the
sound
quality
is
very
good
the
noise
cancellation
is
not
that
robust
but
it
acceptable
also,
with
the
different
sizes
for
the
ear
plugs,
my
yr
old
granddaughter
is
able
to
use
them
as
well
was
excited
to
get
these
since
have
been
useing
some
cheaper
knock
offs
of
the
appleghinking
im
fixing
to
get
sometime
little
betterthere
is
zero
bass
in
these
earphones
what
so
ever
compared
ti
my
chesp
onesthe
music
just
didnt
sound
realistic
honestlywas
just
disapointed
that
there
is
zero
bass
and
all
treble
it
almost
hurts
your
ears
to
listen
to
themwish
the
was
way
to
adjust
them
some
how
gave
this
stars
mainly
because
how
they
fit
for
the
price
these
ear
buds
are
pretty
good,
wish
the
fit
better,
they
seem
to
just
not
fit
quite
right
but
thats
where
$0
pair
would
stand
out
the
sound
is
good,
you
can
tell
the
bass
isnt
the
best
if
you
play
something
thats
bass
heavy,
but
otherwise
sound
is
good
otherwise
everything
else
is
decent,
could
be
better
but
definitely
not
bad
for
the
price
after
two
weeks
of
wearing
these
they
stopped
connecting
love
them
but
they
crapped
out
pretty
quickly
customer
service
took
over
week
to
send
me
out
new
pair,
still
haven
gotten
them
need
these
for
work
and
it
been
hassle
dealing
with
this
wouldn
buy
againgot
replacement
set
and
it
just
stopped
working
after
few
months
in
barely
use
these
and
both
pairs
were
trash
ear
buds
have
nice
snug
fit
they
cancel
out
outside
noise
fairly
well
good
voice
quality
for
making
phone
calls
just
be
careful
with
left
ear
bud
tapping
it
ends
phone
calls
and
the
sensor
is
pretty
sensitive
so
if
you
are
adjusting
it
while
on
the
phone
make
sure
to
only
touch
outside
of
ear
bud
am
very
pleased
with
them
they
are
much
better
than
expected
good
product
for
price
the
battery
life
is
closer
to
hours
than
to
ve
tested
it
multiple
times
in
the
first
week
ve
had
them
and
they
have
not
been
close
to
hours
in
play
time
also,
got
in
sauna
for
mins
and
they
started
acting
up
sound
would
decrease
very
slowly
on
it
on
wish
it
had
more
bass
got
two
of
these
as
gifts,
one
for
my
brother
and
one
for
my
dad
they
both
can't
say
enough
good
things
about
them
they
really
like
the
sound
quality
and
long
charge
life
know
for
certain
they
are
soundproof
because
you
could
yell
from
yard
away
and
they
wouldn't
hear
you
this
earbud
worth
its
price
although
it
is
not
the
best
have
ever
owned,
it
becomes
one
of
my
daily
carries
it
is
lightweight
easy
to
carry
and
also
easy
to
wear
it
can
stay
in
my
ears
very
well
and
insulate
the
outside
noises
have
not
found
frequent
bluetooth
disconnection
yet,
and
there
is
no
lag
when
one
watches
videos
overall,
it
is
decent
product
my
son
wanted
the
apple
version
of
these
but
not
on
my
budget
gambled
with
these
and
won
he
really
loves
them
the
design
it
good
and
the
case
is
nice
he
wasn
at
all
disappointed
with
the
quality
these
earbuds
are
great
for
running
or
working
out
the
box
is
very
practical,
and
can
also
charge
my
phone
with
it
use
them
at
work
and
at
the
gym
sound
quality
and
battery
life
are
perfect,
great
purchase
i've
had
these
headphones
for
few
months
now;
at
first
they
were
great
cancelled
out
noise
perfectly,
volume
was
awesome,
battery
lasts
forever,
etc
all
of
sudden
the
volume
of
the
headphones
slowly
began
to
progressively
decrease
now
at
top
volume
the
headphones
are
barely
at
whisper
and
it's
only
getting
worse
no
did
not
drop
them
in
water
or
damage
them
keep
them
in
their
case,
charge
them
every
few
days
and
still
the
volume
is
slowly
getting
lower
and
lower
for
$0
expect
product
that
lasts
longer
than
few
months
0/0
do
not
recommend
wasting
your
money
on
this
brand
excellent
product
arguably
the
best
in
this
price
range
the
earbuds
are
extremely
comfortable
and
even
after
long
hours
of
usage
don't
hurt
the
fit
is
perfect
for
me,
but
you
can
adjust
it
with
the
different
ear
tips
provided
with
the
earbuds
to
fit
your
ears
the
sound
quality
is
great
for
the
price
they
get
more
than
loud
enough
battery
life
is
also
great
with
around
solid
hours
overall
great
product
would
recommend
to
all
friends
and
family
good
sound
but
they
re
annoying
to
connect
and
the
don
work
away
fromtheir
base
when
called
for
help
they
said
that
it
was
normal
my
right
head
phone
wouldn
work
can
use
them
on
run
which
is
primarily
when
want
both
working
received
these
about
week
ago
plugged
them
in
so
they
had
full
charge,
took
the
earbuds
out
of
the
case
found
x0
in
bluetooth
and
pairing
was
done
great
fit
out
of
the
box
and
plenty
of
other
sizes
available
had
good
sound
and
battery
life
was
really
great
put
in
hrs
night
as
custodian
and
happened
to
put
in
about
hrs
and
still
had
good
battery
left
in
the
buds
really
like
these
and
fact
the
case
will
charge
the
earbuds
and
you
phone
is
big
plus
these
headphones
are
awesome
they
are
much
more
comfortable
that
past
headphones
ve
used
soft
in
the
ears
have
had
these
well
over
month
and
use
them
nearly
every
day
recently
traveled
out
of
the
country
and
the
charge
on
these
lasted
both
my
flight
to
my
destination
and
my
flight
home
with
battery
power
left
great
product
especially
for
the
price
nope
tried
these
as
replacements
for
my
wired
earbuds
they
keep
cutting
out
totally
destroys
the
sound
experience
feet
away
with
my
iphone
not
much
bass
at
all
the
touch
control
to
advance
to
the
next
song
is
sporadic
most
of
the
time
it
just
pauses
the
song
rather
than
advance
double
tap
unless
your
strapped
for
cash,
get
apple
airpods
instead
the
only
good
thing
is
fitment
really
disappointed
and
going
back
to
wired
these
headphones
sound
like
you
stuck
your
head
in
trash
can
the
fit
hurts
after
little
while
of
wear
had
to
take
one
earbud
out
because
it
left
my
ear
raw
battery
life
is
good
and
the
charging
case
is
really
nice
but
other
than
that
you
definitely
get
what
you
pay
for
unfortunately
these
are
really
great
they
are
little
more
expensive
than
some
others
have
purchased
but
they
are
bit
more
higher
quality
as
well
great
sound
and
fit
and
people
tell
me
that
they
can
hear
me
really
well
when
im
on
the
phone
and
using
them
can't
believe
these
were
only
$0
when
amazon
had
deal
should've
bought
pair
they
have
great
functionality
and
quality
sound
very
pleased
with
my
purchase
these
headphones
are
great,
easy
to
use
and
with
decent
sound
like
that
can
charge
my
phone
with
the
case
if
needed
but
most
importantly,
the
customer
service
is
excellent
dropped
the
left
bud
in
water
while
ago
which
broke
it
and
contacted
their
customer
service
they
responded
quickly
and
told
me
they
would
send
replacement
immediately
it
arrived
about
days
later
was
very
impressed
received
the
earbuds
fast
and
on
time
which
is
always
great
sound
is
great
imo
sound
cancellation
is
great
for
me
and
also
they
perfectly
fit
my
ear
which
lot
of
headphones
don't
so
that's
awesome
definitely
would
purchase
another
for
myself
if
needed
and
would
recommend
for
friends
as
for
battery
life
haven't
had
it
long
enough
or
have
used
it
long
enough
to
let
them
die
completely
yet
but
from
what
ive
use
fits
decently
long
great
product
likes:
they're
wireless
obviously
and
the
earbuds
don't
take
very
long
to
chargedislikes:
both
earbuds
have
to
be
on
at
the
same
time
instead
of
having
the
ability
to
use
one
and
keep
the
other
one
off
don't
like
that
keep
charge
for
any
longer
than
hours
when
using
continuous
playback
amazing
this
is
my
first
time
purchasing
wireless
headphones
and
these
have
been
great
they
last
long
long
battery
life
and
they
fit
comfortably
they
come
with
different
sizes
in
the
package
the
sound
is
phenomenal
the
sound
is
something
that's
really
important
to
me,
and
these
did
not
disappoint
very
happy
with
my
purchase
they
are
not
shock
absorbent
and
as
such
they
cut
off
while
walking
and
jogging
highly
recommend
you
invest
more
money
and
purchase
better
quality
ear
buds
do
not
like
to
return
items
because
they
do
not
cost
much
but
am
writing
this
review
to
advise
you
not
to
purchase
these
ear
buds
low
quality
due
to
poor
design
that
leads
to
ineffective
sound
product
stay
away
these
headphones
do
not
have
good
bass
output
there
is
entirely
too
much
treble,
therefore
the
volume
level
is
not
very
high
while
working
out
at
the
gym
had
to
have
the
volume
turned
all
the
way
up
in
order
to
cancel
out
noise
and
was
still
able
to
hear
gym
sounds
my
husband
owns
the
upper
fit
wireless
headphones
and
the
are
much
better
than
this
pair
the
battery
life
was
as
described
and
very
good
quality
the
overall
build
quality
of
these
headphones
is
high
quality
truly
loved
these
headphones
until
listening
to
them
the
first
time
used
these
for
half
marathon
and
they
stayed
in
place
the
entire
time
ran
with
my
sister
so
she
had
one
and
had
one
which
was
fun
way
to
listen
to
the
same
musicbattery
life
didn
last
the
entire
time
that
day
so
probably
lasted
around
hoursthese
are
great
for
everyday
use
really
like
the
ability
to
tap
once
to
pause
my
musiclove
that
the
case
recharges
them
found
the
bluetooth
earbuds
help
me
lot
in
reducing
the
surrounding
noise
so
decided
to
buy
her
this
as
gift
for
my
wife
this
pair
is
the
most
easy
to
use
ones
out
of
all
bluetooth
devices
had
bought
before
moreoever,
it
has
the
longest
battery
lifethe
earbuds
are
easy
to
use
the
automatic
pairing
is
very
easy
to
use
the
earbuds
will
automatically
pair
when
take
them
out
of
the
charging
case
great
product
these
wireless
earbuds
sync
and
connect
very
easily
they
fit
very
well
in
the
ear
and
have
multiple
ear
pieces
to
get
the
perfect
fit
they
last
about
hours
and
charge
quickly
in
the
holder
sound
is
pretty
good
and
great
to
have
these
are
my
first
pair
of
wireless
earphones,
for
$0
you
get
well
made
set
the
earphones
fit
like
glove
and
the
box
is
awesome,
you
can
even
charge
your
phone
with
the
box
only
thing
wished
would
be
different
would
be
the
bass
level
love
bass
and
these
don
seam
to
have
any
other
than
that
still
love
them
for
my
intense
exercises
received
the
earbuds
yesterday
and
wore
them
today
while
mowing
excellent
sound
quality
and
noise
cancellation
amazing
product
for
the
price
recently
bought
pair
of
pasonomi
bluetooth
wireless
earbuds
the
sound
quality
is
better
than
expected
and
the
noise
cancellation
is
very
exceptable,i
would
highly
recommend
model
twsx0
ear
buds
to
anyone
for
jogging
working
out
in
the
gym
pretty
much
any
kind
of
activity
they
fit
very
well
and
bluetooth
connecting
is
pretty
much
effortlessi
would
recommend
these
to
anyone
looking
for
good
product
at
reasonable
price
pros:
good
sound
quality,
great
noise
cancellation
literally,
at
times
can't
hear
things
even
when
music
isn't
playingcons:
"you
get
hours
continuous
music
playtime"
i'm
lucky
if
get
hours
of
continuous
playtime
maybe
the
one
purchased
is
malfunctioning
or
something
but
it
can't
last
through
gym
session
without
dyingoverall,
for
the
price,
they
are
great
but
the
battery
life
is
iffy
have
an
expensive
pair
of
ear
buds
that
came
with
my
phone
and
my
teenage
daughter
wanted
her
own
pair
these
fit
the
bill
and
have
made
her
happypros:

was

these
are
of
great
quality
and
would
definitely
purchase
again
as
unboxed
the
product
was
disappointed
to
find
that
only
received
the
charging
case
no
headphones
were
included
returning,
obviously
these
are
great
wireless
headphones
they
sound
great
and
fit
well
there
are
different
size
pieces
to
fit
in
your
ear
snugly
long

life
they
connect
fast
to
my
phone
and
stay
connected
easy
functionality
the
reason
bought
these
is
for
traveling
not
only
does
the
case
charge
the
earbuds
themselves
but
you
can
also
charge
your
phone
from
their
case
am
definitely
purchasing
these
again
for
my
kids
for
our
long
trips
they
are
very
comfortable
in
the
ear
cancel
out
noise
very
well
the
fact
that
they
come
with
case
that
charges
them
and
bag
helps
with
anti
lost
my
favorite
features
are
how
you
can
tap
to
change
songs
or
talk
to
bixby
through
them
to
answer
or
make
calls
well
worth
the
money
waste
of
money
the
right
earbud
on
my
pair
has
stopped
charging
prior
to
that,
the
buds
almost
never
pair
to
the
phone
seamlessly
wanted
to
use
these
for
running
but
the
last
thing
want
to
do
during
run
is
stop
and
mess
around
with
pairing
some
janky
earbuds
better
off
with
wire
earbuds
so
many
devices
out
there
these
days
with
more
technology
than
the
cheap
manufacturing
can
handle
when
first
got
these
earbuds
was
excited
they
had
great
quality
and
sound
one
thing
they
never
did
was
allow
me
to
use
to
talk
on
my
phone
after
yr
the
buds
don't
stay
connected
to
my
phone
so
unfortunately
have
to
buy
new
ones
i've
only
been
using
this
product
for
few
days,
but
in
the
short
time
that
i've
been
using
it
have
to
say
they
work
quite
well
the
only
downside
have
noticed
thus
far
is
that
occasionally
the
right
earpiece
fails
to
connect
via
bluetooth
and
the
battery
life
is
bit
low
but
believe
it's
not
too
far
off
from
what
was
advertised
overall,
think
its
great
product
and
big
step
up
from
what
using
previously
absolutely
love
these
earbuds
theyre
loud
and
cancel
out
noise
so
its
good
if
you
are
working
out
or
even
if
you
want
to
study
and
listen
to
brown
noise
something
to
note
is
that
the
earbuds
are
very
sensitive
to
touch
but
thats
moreso
pro
in
the
long
run
than
con
as
you
get
used
to
it
they
pair
very
easily
and
they
last
while
best
of
all
they
fit
in
snug
and
dont
come
out
no
more
wire
no
more
untangling
cables
no
more
mess
had
bit
of
difficulty
pairing
there
isn't
much
to
guide
you
when
you
search
the
web;
however,
once
that
hurdle
was
past
the
sound
quality
is
amazing;
and,
the
fit
is
very
comfortable
it
is
well
worth
it's
cost
used
and
abused
pair
hard
though
flop
sweat
runs
in
the
rain
they
endured
for
months
each
piece
holding
charge
for
0+
hours
not
sure
what
their
limit
was
but
never
reached
it
eventually
my
right
ear
piece
stopped
holding
charge,
emailed
their
support
and
on
the
same
day
theyb
replied
to
me
and
they
immediately
shipped
me
brand
new
pair
which
had
been
working
amazinglyi
highly
reccomend
both
these
headphones
as
well
as
this
company
i'm
very
skeptical
with
headphones
or
earbuds,
but
this
"pasonomi
twsx0"
are
actually
really
good
only
problem
is
you
have
to
replace
the
silicone
ear
tips
for
better
ones
or
the
sound
quality
will
not
be
as
good
if
you
keep
the
originals,
did
it
and
after
that
liked
them
like
them
so
much
that
don't
use
my
"bose
earbuds"
anymome
the
most
expensive
on
the
marketto
be
fair
and
honest
you
can
do
almost
everything
with
this
earbuds
just
like
the
name
brands
without
having
to
pay
lot
product
was
ok
at
first
started
off
using
just
my
left
ear
piece
mostly
it
was
ok
for
that
sound
isn
great
but
it
ok
problem
had
most
and
is
annoying
is
when
had
both
in
my
right
ear
piece
is
cutting
in
and
out
constantly
to
the
point
where
don
even
want
to
wear
them
anymore
ll
be
looking
for
new
product
elsewhere
good
small
and
light
very
easy
to
connect
to
my
iphone
like
black
and
sound
quality
is
good
and
clear
it
looks
cool
wear
them
every
day
and
easy
to
clean
just
they
are
little
big
to
my
ear
and
overall
it
worth
the
price
bought
these
for
work
desk
job
so
could
listen
to
music/podcasts
great
because
one
can
charge
while
you're
using
the
other
one
so
can
still
hear
everything
around
me
and
dont
feel
rude
when
someone
walks
up
i've
had
no
problems
with
them
after
about
months
for
the
price
dont
think
you'll
get
anything
better
sound
quality
is
pretty
good
too
so
far
am
loving
these
earbuds
the
sound
quality
is
great
and
hear
enough
bass
in
the
music
unfortunately
on
phone
calls
have
to
tell
for
the
person
on
the
other
line
to
hear
me,
but
hear
them
very
well
was
most
shocked
that
they
fit
so
comfortably
in
my
ears
have
hard
time
finding
earbuds
that
fit
my
ear
without
hurting
or
falling
out
hopefully
with
some
more
playing
around
with
them
i'll
figure
out
how
to
make
sure
can
be
heard
better
on
calls
these
wireless
headphones
are
first
and
foremost,
great
purchase
for
the
price
they
function
as
bluetooth
earbuds
should
from
my
experience,
the
fit
and
comfort,
sound
quality,
and
battery
are
all
what
was
looking
for
in
product
very
pleased
as
dancer,
really
wanted
the
headphones
so
that
could
dance
without
disturbing
others
in
the
studio
with
music
even
with
many
movements,
these
headphones
stay
in
place
and
do
their
job
recommend
these
started
out
ok
but
by
the
0rd
day
0get
began
to
make
this
loud
noise
during
phone
swings
calls
that
sound
like
hair
clippers
in
my
ear
whomever
would
talk
would
ask
why
my
phone
sounded
that
way
the
call
would
then
drop
don't
reccomend
this
product
these
ear
buds
are
amazing
for
the
price
but
the
best
part
about
them
is
the
battery
even
the
samsung
pods
dont
last
this
long
the
fact
that
it
doubles
as
portable
charger
is
life
saver
bought
these
roughly
two
months
ago
and
the
right
earbud
no
longer
works
correctly
it
only
produces
very
low
sound
output
tried
reset,
and
other
recommendations
troubleshooting
steps
to
no
availupdate:
updating
the
earbuds
actually
eventually
works
the
right
just
had
an
earwax
buildup
upping
review
to
stars
these
are
great
for
music
but
terrible
for
calls
duration
is
as
good
as
advertised
the
charging
case
and
backup
battery
are
nice
but
mine
could
not
charge
them
both
up
once
ordered
these
after
amazon
deal
of
the
day
was
bust
would
not
pair
at
allordered
these
next
and
love
them
so
easy
to
pair,
charge,
take
the
bud
out
and
it
pairs
and
play
automatically
couldn't
be
happier
with
these
wireless
buds
see
ya
apple
lol
am
quite
careful
consumer
when
it
comes
to
buying
audio
devices
use
high
quality
bose
and
sony
headphones
on
daily
basis
so
am
particular
when
it
comes
to
the
quality
of
my
music
have
had
low
quality
bluetooth
earbuds
in
the
past
and
they
were
terrible
these
however
are
outstanding
for
the
price
premium
feel
and
decent
connection
strength
they
also
have
very
good
sound
quality
for
this
extremely
cheep
price
point
after
only
days,
the
right
earbud
stopped
being
able
to
pair
with
the
left
earbud
they
would
spend
minutes
looking
for
each
other
and
then
give
up
the
left
one
would
then
be
able
to
pair
with
my
phone,
but
would
be
unable
to
use
the
right
one
great
for
everyday
use
ve
been
using
them
all
day
and
work
in
sales
super
easy
with
the
touch
capacitive
pads
very
easy
user
controls
good
sound
and
great
for
all
day
comfort
glad
bought
these
and
not
$0
+
on
competition
buds
they
are
not
as
loud
as
would
like
and
randomly
one
ear
bud
will
stop
working
and
have
to
put
them
both
back
in
the
charging
case
to
reconnect
that
wouldn't
be
so
bad
except
while
am
at
the
gym
don't
carry
the
charging
case
with
me
so
it's
just
more
of
an
inconvenience
beautiful
packaging
comes
with
extra
cushion
tips
for
perfect
fit
the
sound
is
amazing
they
are
extremely
comfortable
and
usually
have
problems
with
earbuds
hurting
my
earslove
the
storage
bag
and
the
users
manual
answers
all
questions
about
operationvery,
very
pleased
love
that
these
headphones
also
have
charging
station
with
it
for
your
phone
multiple
purpose
is
always
plus
for
me
these
days
have
another
pair
of
name
brand
wireless
headphones
and
received
these
as
gift
was
surprised
at
the
sound
quality
of
these
compared
to
my
other
ones
great
gift
loved
them
at
first
but
only
worked
for
months
for
the
price
expected
them
to
last
longer
left
ear
stops
working
just
as
other
reviews
say
don
waste
your
money
do
have
bass
in
my
earbuds
charge
good,
connect
we
ll
and
overall
impressed
will
try
at
my
loud
factory
job
and
update
review
if
they
do
not
get
loud
enough
otherwise
am
happy
after
about
month,
my
earbuds
struggled
to
connect
to
each
other
if
at
all
they
have
an
amazing
battery
life,
especially
the
case
however,
when
they
won't
connect
to
each
other,
it's
pretty
big
problem
because
of
only
one
earbud
workingkeep
in
mind,
the
left
one
is
the
only
one
that
will
connect
to
the
bluetooth
extremely
nice
for
the
price
and
comes
with
compact
charging
case
they
stay
snug
in
my
ears
and
yet
to
have
them
die
on
me
after
hours
of
usage
beats
having
headphones
with
cords
bouncing
around
received
them
as
gift
and
since
then,
have
not
stopped
using
them
sound
great,
comfortable
to
use
can
manage
the
battery
time
but
it
would
have
been
great
if
they
had
an
on/off
switch
read
the
manual
and
didn't
found
anything
in
the
topic
or
don't
know
if
i'm
doing
somethin
wrong
besides
that,
love
them
this
is
my
first
set
of
wireless
earbuds,
so
for
fifty
bucks,
its
good
purchase
know
didn
buy
bose,
beats
or
some
other
topoftheline
brand,
so
not
disappointed
with
the
sound
quality
length
of
charge
is
fine
unless
you
wear
earbuds
0/0
fit
is
good,
nestles
in
the
ear
and
the
soft
tips
can
be
changed
for
different
ears
haven
had
any
pairing
issues
because
read
the
directions
the
headphones
came
in
the
mail
and
after
getting
them
to
full
charge
went
through
the
process
of
the
setup
bluetooth
worked
perfectly
for
both
earbuds
sound
quality
is
absolutley
perfect
with
deep
sound
not
tinny
and
they
are
plenty
loud
enough
to
block
out
noise
around
you
they
fit
and
are
secure
in
my
ear
very
comfortable
they
seem
built
well
enough
to
be
durable
however
time
will
tell
if
they
last
we
ordered
this
item
and
had
it
replaced,
but
it
had
the
same
problem
my
girlfriend
noticed
that
if
she
laid
her
glasses
on
the
charging
station
it
weighed
the
earphones
down
enough
that
they
would
actually
charge
so
if
you
re
one
of
those
customers
out
there
who
was
as
frustrated
as
we
were,
one
of
the
solutions
you
can
use
is
to
weigh
the
earphones
down
so
they
ll
charge
right
if
you
are
one
of
the
engineers
who
designed
this,
recognize
you
can
just
increase
the
weight
of
the
earphones
and
that
will
solve
your
charging
problem
you
can
thank
my
girlfriend
anytime
the
earbuds
were
working
great
when
first
got
them
was
very
satisfied
with
them
until
week
after
using
them
they
lost
its
sound
increase
the
volume
all
the
way
up
and
can
barely
hear
anything
theres
sound
coming
out
but
it
is
minimal
not
the
same
as
when
first
got
them
at
first
thought
maybe
they
were
running
out
of
battery;
but
after
night
of
having
the
earbuds
charging
the
sound
was
the
same
the
day
after
now
the
right
ear
bud
will
not
connect
anymore
no
matter
what
try
i'd
give
these
headphones
out
of
they
possess
excellent
sound
quality
with
pretty
bass
response
solid
construction
the
charging
case
is
very
nice
the
only
drawbacks
found
were
the
inability
to
turn
them
on
and
off
on
the
touchpad
and
the
provided
earcups
disnt
come
big
enough
to
accommodate
larger
ear
openings
definitely
would
recommend
these
headphones
to
others
excellent
price
for
the
quality
would
purchase
again
myself
the
headphones
are
comfortable
and
the
sound
is
good,
but
like
several
other
reviews,
one
of
the
earbuds
cuts
out
regularly
while
walking,
running,
or
hiking
too
late
to
return:edit:
the
manufacturer
contacted
me
to
refund
the
purchase
price
without
return,
i'm
updating
the
review
based
on
that
if
they
stand
by
their
product,
that's
good
enough
for
me
if
was
sitting
at
my
desk
using
these
would
be
more
than
pleased
they
are
comfortable
and
have
decent
sound
my
issue
is
at
the
gym
my
hairlength
is
about
the
same
as
where
the
headphone
sits
in
my
ear
as
get
sweaty
it
will
drip
from
my
hair
onto
the
headphone
and
activate
the
voicecalling
feature
or
slowly
turn
the
volume
all
the
way
down
i've
had
issues
with
the
voicecalling
feature
coming
on
with
the
mildest
touch
on
accident
but
otherwise
love
them
have
only
had
them
for
months
and
the
sound
barley
works
in
the
right
ear
budupdate:
replacement
set
was
sent
to
me
and
completely
quit
working
within
months
would
recommend
staying
away
from
this
brand
so
far
think
these
earbuds
are
fabulous
for
the
money
they
were
recommended
by
friend
that
has
had
them
for
year
and
uses
them
mostly
while
running
my
only
issue
was
that
could
not
receive
them
at
my
po
box
sent
them
to
my
neighbors
address
and
they
wouldn
fit
in
her
mailbox
with
her
mail
so
they
ended
up
at
the
post
office
anyway
:/
received
these
headphones
in
the
mail
today
the
packaging
was
fine
and
the
instructions
were
rather
simple
was
able
to
pair
the
headphones
to
my
iphone
in
less
than
one
minute
the
headphones
come
in
charger
box
with
cord,
case,
and
multiple
ear
pieces
found
the
headphones
to
be
extremely
comfortable
and
the
sound
was
good
quality
am
unsure
of
how
they
will
hold
up
during
run
or
workout
since
just
took
them
out
of
the
box
they
seem
to
be
worth
the
money
the
earbuds
and
charge
box
work
great
the
case
is
extra
power
bank
for
my
phonegreat
battery
life,strong
reliable
connect,
and
good
audio
quality
the
design
is
simple
and
easy
to
use,if
you
want
truly
wireless
earbuds
buy
these
brought
this
wireless
earbuds
for
my
son
for
christmas
and
he
loves
it
it
comes
in
nice
black
case
the
battery
charges
really
fast
he
usually
doesn
like
wearing
wireless
headsets
because
it
doesn
feel
comfortable
but
he
loves
how
these
fit
in
his
ears
the
sound
quality
is
great
will
buy
another
one
for
myself
the
product
is
great
love
so
much
that
used
it
almost
everyday
one
of
the
earbuds
failed
to
charge
after
about
extensive
use
for
0months
sent
the
seller
an
email
and
he/she
sent
me
replacement
great
service
just
average
ear
bud
here
nothing
more/less
lack
of
bass
stay
on
battery
last
decent
per
charge
like
the
set
just
don't
like
the
battery
life
it
only
last
hours
of
continuous
play
time
have
had
some
that
last
hours
comfort
is
an
issue
originally
purchased
for
my
0yo
daughter
and
she
complained
they
hurt
her
ears
as
she
thought
they
were
too
large
so
started
to
use
them
and
after
wearing
for
an
hour
determined
she
was
correct
the
sound
is
fine
battery
life
goes
out
quicker
than
you
can
really
start
jamming
out
to
tunes
the
earbuds
remain
in
the
ears
well
enough
to
not
fidget
with
them
constantly,
and
the
noise
nullification
depends
on
how
high
your
audio
is
nothing
special
but
also
not
completely
something
to
throwaway
the
sound
quality
of
the
headphones
is
as
low
as
you
can
possibly
get
no
bass,
very
tinny
sounding
kind
of
like
you
are
listening
through
one
of
those
soup
can
on
string
things
from
cartoonsthe
functionality
is
surprisingly
really
good:
they
connected
to
bluetooth
very
easily,
they
charged
up
well,
they
were
comfortable,
the
case
is
really
convenient
&
they
fit
my
ears
snugly
i'm
sad
that
have
to
return
them
but
care
about
sound
quality
owned
this
product
for
months,
worked
well,
then
the
left
ear
bud
stops
charging
think
it
has
to
do
with
defect
in
the
charging
case
not
surprised
this
happened
as
may
have
been
unlucky
and
just
gotten
defective
product,
but
unlike
buying
more
established
headphone,
there
was
no
warrantee
on
this
and
amazon
refused
to
exchange
them
or
take
them
back
whether
you
re
listening
to
music
on
your
phone
making
phone
call
or
facetimeing
these
earbuds
are
awesome
the
lifespan
of
the
battery
is
great
but
the
charging
box
is
even
better
and
they
re
very
very
comfortable
clear,
crisp
and
durable
would
highly
recommend
they
said
that
they
were
waterproof,
so
got
them
for
showering
soon
found
that
too
often
after
getting
them
wet,
the
sound
would
cut
out
and
return
and
sometimes
the
volume
would
go
up
or
down
on
its
own
or
the
track
would
jump
to
the
next
every
now
and
then,
would
have
good
shower
with
no
incidents
the
first
pair
received
did
not
work
as
expected,
the
company
sent
me
replacement
and
they
work
great
work
out
with
these
and
do
not
experience
the
ear
pain
as
with
other
products
bought
these
for
my
year
old
son
he
loves
everything
about
them
he
uses
them
for
hands
free
phone
calls
while
driving
as
well
as
listening
to
music
and
videos
being
waterproof
and
charging
case
are
huge
pluses
love
the
fact
can
wear
them
comfortably
under
ear
muffs
at
work
or
in
motorcycle
helmet
with
no
compression
problem
and
ear
irritation
got
these
earbuds
mainly
for
study
purpose
ve
used
it
for
few
times
now
great
sound
nice
to
move
around
without
wire
in
between
me
and
my
ipad
battery
last
for
long
time
super
convenient
this
is
great
alternative
for
those
more
expensive
ones
out
there
highly
recommended
really
love
these
earbuds,
because
of
my
schedule
have
to
use
them
everyday
so
far
they
link
easily
and
are
good
with
noise
canceling
the
battery
life
always
displays
lower
than
0%
on
all
of
my
devices
even
if
they
have
been
charged
over
night,
they
still
say
0%
the
battery
lasts
for
hrs
and
the
sound
is
great
they
work
up
to
feet
away
from
my
computer
overall,
is
day
they
are
good
accept
the
incorrect
battery
level
am
thoroughly
impressed
by
these
ear
phones
wanted
something
to
wear
while
working
out,
so
took
shot
by
getting
thesethey
have
really
good
sound
quality
and
they
stay
in
my
ears
through
my
entire
gym
sessioni
was
also
surprised
at
how
long
charge
lasts
for
these
can
typically
go
three
weeks
in
between
charges,
which
for
me,
is
about
hours
of
listeningi
definitely
recommend
these
ear
phones
it
started
with
good
sound
quality
now
it
very
low
even
when
fully
charged
had
other
ppl
listening
they
told
me
the
same
very
low
sound
bought
it
on
july
0th,
only
use
them
once
day
for
the
gym
very
upset
ear
buds
stays
in
place
but
for
what
can
hear
everyone
around
me
—
paired
with
an
iphone
latest
edition
wonder
if
they
have
warranty
we
all
know
apple
products
are
grossly
overpriced,
so
if
you'd
like
quality
headphones
for
fraction
of
the
price,
these
are
great
pick
charging
case
works
great,
sound
is
clear
and
highquality
don't
make
my
ears
hurt
after
prolonged
periods
of
use
comes
with
bunch
of
different
size
adjusters
to
get
that
perfectly
snug
fit
highly
recommended
these
headphones
are
pretty
awesome
their
sound
quality
is
great
and
they
fit
very
comfortably
in
your
ears
they
also
come
with
convenient
charging
station
to
charge
themselves
and
also
your
usb
device
these
headphones
are
simply
awesome
their
microphone
picks
up
tons
of
sound,
and
their
sound
quality
is
something
you
would
expect
from
full
ear
muff
set
of
headphones
worked
great
for
couple
days,
then
left
ear
bud
started
to
get
low
and
cut
out
now
both
cut
in
and
out
randomly
and
at
fast
rate
they
go
on
and
off
times
in
matter
of
few
second
catch
myself
switching
back
to
wires
bluetooth
earbuds
more
than
should
which
had
replacement
to
see
if
these
were
defected
or
if
they
are
all
defectedpaired
with

xs
max
love
these
headphones
my
coworker
suggested
them
to
me
and
it
took
me
too
long
to
listen
to
her
advice
these
headphones
are
the
best
wireless
bluetooth
headphones
have
ever
used
love
that
when
listening
to
music,
can
pause
by
tapping
the
headphone
these
are
very
comfortable
and
the
microphone
works
great
when
taking
calls
bought
these
for
everyday
commuting
blue
tooth
is
very
glitchy
with
phone
in
pocket
and
case
in
other
cannot
stay
connected
have
used
these
on
treadmill,
they
do
stay
connected,
maybe
cause
phone
is
stationary
would
not
purchase
again
these
sounded
like
airplane
headphones,
flatbattery
life
was
awfulreturned
and
sprung
for
the
bose
earbuds
which
are
excellent
this
was
my
first
wireless
ear
bud
purchase
and
thought
did
enough
research,
but
unfortunately
these
let
me
down
had
pair
of
around
the
neck
wireless
headphones
and
wanted
to
finally
change
it
up
music
sounds
alright
they
have
hard
time
connecting
to
each
other
every
now
and
then,
but
the
biggest
part,
call
quality
every
person
that
ve
tried
talking
to
on
the
phone
while
wearing
the
ear
buds
has
told
me
that
it
sounds
like
holding
pillow
over
my
mouth
and
trying
to
talk
definitely
let
down
they
are
decent
if
you
just
want
some
music
listening

right

this
works
great
able
to
take
the
ear
buds
out
and
they
connect
right
to
my
phone
sound
quality
is
great
especially
for
this
price
people
are
able
to
understand
me
on
the
mic,
not
sure
how
good
but
no
one
has
complained
:
they
fit
in
my
ears
good
too
able
to
workout
and
run
and
they
don
budge
the
case
works
great
like
the
fact
can
charge
my
phone
from
if
need
be
0st
time
purchasing
these
headphones,
i'm
pleased
with
the
product
overall,
they
connect
quickly
and
are
comfortable,
have
listened
to
them
for
hours
until
prompted
to
charge
not
the
best
for
talking
or
extended
conversations
would
recommend
to
anyone
interested
in
listening
to
music
while
working
out,
or
watching
your
favorite
shows
on
your
phone
enjoy
the
recharging
capability
they
have
and
have
even
recharged
my
phone
couple
of
times
like
these
but
the
battery
only
lasts
about
hours
so
they
don
make
it
whole
day
at
work
can
charge
them
at
lunch
however
bought
random
pair
of
wireless
earbuds
years
ago
these
are
definite
upgrade
the
sound
is
great
overall
it
does
lack
little
bassthe
size
surprised
me
they're
pretty
small
and
don't
stand
out
muchconnectivity
is
great
connects
to
the
phone
right
away
if
you
use
one
at
time
or
switch
sides
it
reroutes
instantlyas
far
as
comfort
,
i've
never
had
ear
buds
fit
as
snuggly
as
this
pair
ever
might
not
be
the
same
for
everyone
else
but
this
was
another
pleasant
surprise
as
well
these
headphones
were
great
find
they
fit
really
comfortably
and
had
great
sound
quality
charging
them
in
the
case
is
really
easy
and
keeps
them
protected
on
the
go
had
no
trouble
pairing
them
easily
didn
know
which
side
of
the
case
to
open
when
first
got
them,
but
that
was
my
own
operator
error
recommend
these
use
these
daily
now
while
exercising
and
haven
had
an
issue
the
on/off
button
may
be
little
sensitive
when
you
do
some
minor
adjustments
but
overall
great
product
these
headphones
are
very
uncomfortable
even
with
the
varying
sizes
of
gel
inserts,
the
size
of
the
receiver
is
huge
and
doesn't
fit
in
my
ear
if
you
have
average
sized
ears,
don't
buy
this
as
it
will
acje
within
minutes
the
sound
is
really
bad
and
flat
they
are
comfortable
to
wear,
they
charge
in
the
case
and
they
sound
great
also
like
that
you
can
see
through
the
top
of
the
case
when
you're
charging
it
or
if
the
earbuds
are
charging
in
it
you
don't
have
to
open
the
top
to
see
if
either
the
case
or
the
earbuds
are
charging
also
like
that
there
are
magnets
that
hold
the
top
closed
as
well
as
the
ones
that
keep
the
earbuds
secure
in
the
case
really
love
these
earbuds
they
last
for
long
time,
and
charge
really
quick
love
the
portability
for
the
case,
made
it
really
easy
to
charge
and
carry
my
earbuds
also,
these
earbuds
have
great
bass,
only
if
you
adjust
the
equalizer
sae
many
reviews
saying
it
has
terrible
bass,
but
you
will
need
to
adjust
your
sound
settings
to
get
bass
love
these
ear
buds
bought
pair
for
my
husband
couple
months
ago,
and
this
pair
is
for
me
great
sound,
light
weight,
and
love
the
charging
case
connect
easily
to
my
phone
highly
recommended
these
are
great
alternative
to
apple
headphones
they're
more
comfortable
and
the
sound
quality
is
a0
my
only
issue
is
that
the
noise
cancellation
isn't
that
great
and
i've
gotten
complaints
that
my
background
is
extremely
loud
while
using
them
overall
good
buy
though
bought
these
for
my
husband
for
christmas
they
were
fine
for
the
first
months
in
april
the
right
ear
bud
started
to
go
out,
and
then
in
may
it
completed
stopped
working
not
worth
the
money
you
get
what
you
pay
for
best
investment
so
far,
if
you
have
small
ear
canal,
these
are
for
you
they
fit
so
nice
in
your
ear
no
movement
at
all
love
them
loved
it
sound
quality
is
just
perfect
usually
like
right
balance
between
bass
and
tribal
and
found
this
one
as
ideal
for
me
bought
this
to
play
pubg
because
have
iphone
and
can
use
regular
earphones
when
charging
and
this
guys
just
works
great
for
that
battery
life
is
really
good
highly
recommend
these
headphones
they
are
super
comfy
and
have
high
bass
am
planning
to
buy
one
more
and
gift
it
to
my
sister
like
some
of
the
other
reviewers,
these
earbuds
worked
perfectly
for
about
year
the
speaker
of
one
earbud
died
just
one
week
after
the
oneyear
warranty
from
the
company
expired
in
short,
the
earbuds
were
great
while
they
lasted,
but
they
just
didn't
last
long
great
earbuds
for
shortterm
solution
to
your
wireless
earbud
needs
these
are
great
they
fit
and
they
re
don
fall
out
they
sound
great
and
love
how
can
use
one
or
two
headphones
if
like
bought
it
and
immediately
started
using
them
it
took
two
days
for
the
portable
charger
to
finally
die
the
headphones
are
easy
to
carry
around
and
they
fit
nicely
in
my
ear
was
bit
worried
they
would
fall
out
of
my
ear
when
im
running
or
working
out,
but
so
far
they
are
good
the
bluetooth
connection
is
also
pretty
good,
and
instantly
connects
to
my
iphonethe
sound
is
also
pretty
good,
although
hear
slight
static
sound,
but
this
might
be
normal
for
all
bluetooth
headphones
overall
these
headphones
are
pretty
good
and
theyre
lot
cheaper
than
the
apple
ipods
wowthese
bluetooth
earpods
are
excellent
they
fit
and
feel
extremely
comfortable
the
sound
quality
is
great,
much
better
than
what
expected
for
the
cost
the
battery
life
is
is
outstanding
and
the
charging
case
is
very
convenient
workout
and
get
sweaty
and
these
little
gems
stay
in
place
without
any
problems
they
are
great
and
am
loving
them
my
middle
school
aged
son
bought
these
for
himself
with
his
own
money
he
did
lots
of
research
and
looked
for
earbuds
that
would
fit
his
small
ears
but
would
still
have
great
sound
quality
the
charging
case
was
bonus
he
loves
them
great
price
and
great
sound
quality
after
months
of
constant
use
one
of
the
charging
nubs
broke
off
great
customer
service
sent
us
new
charging
case
quickly
liked
them
so
much
bought
pair
for
myself
would
definitely
recommend
got
these
after
reading
reviews
and
description
and
all
was
false
the
sound
quality
is
like
walkman
headphones
from
the
early
0s
no
noise
cancelation
at
all
the
music
also
gets
interrupted
and
skips
every
time
you
move
your
phone
these
ear
buds
are
so
comfortable
they
fit
perfectly
in
the
ear
the
sound
quality
is
amazing
it
holds
great
charge
and
their
range
is
pretty
good
they
synced
up
quickly
would
recommend
these
wireless
earbuds
have
great
battery
life
they
charge
quickly
and
automatically
connect
to
your
device
after
taking
them
out
of
the
case
nice
for
working
out,
stay
in
your
ear
no
matter
what
you're
doing
and
are
comfortable
only
negatives:
the
bass
is
lacking
and
you
cannot
talk
over
the
phone
with
theseupdate:broke
after
light
use
these
are
great
can
even
imagine
product
being
any
better
than
this
excellent
guality,
great
fit,
and
easy
to
use,
and
they
stay
charged
for
long
time
these
earbuds
seemed
good
at
first,
but
as
time
went
on
started
to
see
flaws
they
would
come
out
of
my
ears
when
worked
out,
and
wouldn't
connect
to
my
phone
correctly,
the
sound
would
start
to
glitch
as
if
it
was
loosing
reception
or
something,
and
finally
one
of
the
earbuds
stopped
working
at
all
would
not
recommend
these
battery
life
and
charging
time
are
excellent
connection
is
about
par
with
other
bluetooth
headphones
i've
used
in
the
past
the
"true
wireless"
aspect
is
something
that's
been
long
time
coming
purchased
these
to
replace
the
other
wireless
earbuds
bought
so
far
love
them
they
sound
great
and
love
being
able
to
charge
my
phone
with
the
built
in
mobile
power
bank
came
with
plenty
of
different
sized
ear
pieces
which
is
great
due
to
needing
two
different
sizes
for
each
ear
definitely
recommend
these
to
friend
wireless
earbud
just
life
saver
if
you
are
tired
of
those
twisted
wires
charge
is
fast
and
really
last
long
because
the
case
itself
can
charge
the
earbud
sound
quality
not
bad
and
the
design
is
nice
it
fits
the
ear
and
not
cause
discomfort
when
wear
for
long
time
the
only
thing
is
that
some
time
leave
it
at
the
desk
and
my
cat
likes
to
play
with
them
was
okay
wireless
ear
bud
my
main
issues,
no
response
from
seller
regarding
question
and
only
able
to
pair
to
one
device
at
time
sound
was
ok
bluetooth
connection
was
not
the
best
if
held
my
phone
while
on
walk
the
connection
was
fine
but
stick
the
phone
in
my
pocket
forget
it
worst
part
was
the
left
earbud
cannot
charge
anymore
would
not
recommend
this
product
actually
much
better
than
what
expected
batteries
last
long
period
of
time
use
them
all
the
time
love
these
headphones
use
them
at
work
sound
is
crystal
clear
and
can
be
used
relatively
far
away
from
your
device
like
the
fact
that
you
can
only
use
one
of
them
if
desired
as
well
which
makes
still
hearing
around
your
surroundings
easy
definitely
recommend
this
product
is
amazing
was
hesitant
to
purchase
it
seeing
as
how
so
many
other
wireless
earphones
are
more
expensive
but
after
purchasing,
have
absolutely
no
regrets
and
wholly
recommend
it
to
anyone
considering
it
haven
had
it
for
long
but
so
far
it
been
the
best
experience
the
earbud
battery
even
lasts
longer
than
hours
for
me
after
playing
music
continuously
so
happy
ran
across
this
product
my
order
was
fast,
easy,
and
on
time
the
ear
buds
do
everything
as
advertised
the
case
will
charge
your
cell
phone
quite
well
they
are
easy
to
use
and
pair
with
any
cellphone
they
don't
fall
out
of
your
ears
they
fit
very
snug
with
out
any
pain
wonderful
product
to
purchase
loved
these
headphones
when
they
worked
they
fit
perfect
the
sound
quality
was
amazing
however
they
stopped
pairing
to
themselves
thus
can
only
hear
my
music
out
of
one
channel
at
time
have
read
every
article
on
like
to
repair
them
together
without
success
really
disappointed
as
these
were
amazing
when
they
worked
got
my
replacement
pair
from
the
company
which
has
great
customer
service,
but
the
second
pooped
out
and
won't
reset
just
like
the
first
pair
after
under
uses
brought
it
on
trip
and
was
unreliable
and
had
to
buy
other
ones
simply
just
doesn't
work
at
least
for
me
good
quality
have
been
using
these
for
few
months
now,
and
there
is
no
sign
of
wear
or
quality
loss
can
see
these
lasting
for
many
years
the
sounds
quality
is
exceptional
ve
had
these
ear
buds
for
few
days
now
and
got
to
say
that
was
skeptical
at
first
but
am
now
believer
sound
quality
is
great,
they
look
and
feel
great
as
well
like
the
ease
of
setting
them
up
as
well
had
my
son
try
them
for
the
day
and
he
commented
on
how
great
the
sound
is
and
he
likes
that
they
re
pretty
loud
he
will
be
getting
pair
for
himself
as
well
had
such
high
hopes
for
this
product,
given
the
great
reviewsthe
good:
ear
fit
was
great
and
secure
pairing
was
easy
changing
songs
with
double
tap
worked
wellcons
:
volume
control
kept
enabling
siri⬇
this
is
the
biggest
con
possible
sound
quality
was
terrible
big
echo
with
zero
bass
like
previous
review
said,
quality
is
comparable
to
0$
headsetreturning
product
wonderful
earbuds
fit
comfortably
and
snugly
just
take
them
out
of
the
charging
case,
and
they
auto
connect
bluetooth
this
case
automatically
charges
the
earbuds
and
can
also
charge
your
cell
phone
sound
is
terrific
highly
recommend
absolutely
the
right
call
i'm
on
week
two
and
wear
them
everywhere
to
do
everything
great
sound
good
bass
and
treble
really
good
battery
life
in
rain,
snow,
the
gym,
running
love
these
things
classical
dance
music
podcasts
solid
choice
these
headphones
are
great
like
to
powerlift
and
was
surprised
that
the
headphones
did
not
fall
out
during
heavy
deadlifts
all
of
the
controls
are
done
by
touching
or
tapping
the
sides
of
each
headphone,
which
is
pretty
convenient
the
case
also
acts
as
charge
bank,
which
found
pretty
niftyone
con
of
the
headphones
is
that
they
lack
real
bass
feel
in
the
ear
also
the
bluetooth
range
seemed
bit
short,
but
for
the
price
don
think
it
can
get
better
can
wait
to
let
the
fiancée
try
them
as
well
finally,
found
the
earbuds
that
can
fit
my
ear
before
bought
this
earbuds,
tried
several
different
one,
but
my
ear
is
small,
so
none
of
them
could
fit
in
cannot
say
that
it
fit
perfectly,
but
at
least
can
use
it
and
it
doesn
fall
it
comes
with
different
sizes
of
earbuds
it
will
be
great
for
many
people
the
quality
of
sound
is
good
will
buy
another
one
for
my
husband
high
sound
quality
and
connects
to
my
phone
fast
comfortable
to
wear
and
stays
in
when
running
holds
long
charge
and
the
case
is
awesome
as
well
it
can
recharge
the
earbuds
and
also
be
used
as
charger
for
your
phone
great
buy
bought
this
product
less
than
months
ago
volume
is
way
to
low
especially
with
itunes
hear
the
music
at
the
gym
on
the
speakers
more
than
in
my
ear
it
only
gets
worse
with
sound
everyday
horrible
product
it
comfortable
for
long
time
wearing
use
them
while
working
at
my
desk
throughout
the
day
the
sound
quality
is
good
and
easy
to
setup
they
auto
connect
to
my
device
every
time
love
the
compact
design
of
the
charging
case
these
are
very
good
quality
purchased
them
for
the
gym
because
didn't
want
to
take
and
possibly
lose
my
expensive
bose
to
my
surprise
the
sound
quality
is
just
about
comparable
battery
lasts
long
time
and
the
charge
time
is
fast
looked
at
what
felt
like
million
true
wireless
headphones
online
before
finally
deciding
on
these
the
sound
quality
has
been
fantastic
and
so
has
the
connectivity
through
the
bluetooth
did
not
lose
connection
while
going
for
run
or
just
doing
yard
work
around
the
house
was
worried
they
would
feel
too
big
for
my
ears,
but
they
worked
well
and
stayed
in
place,
even
when
running
recommend
them
while
using
headphones
the
right
earphone
will
cut
in
and
out
in
random
moments
which
can
be
really
frustrating
noise
cancellation
is
great
and
have
not
had
problem
with
battery
life
yet
not
super
comfortable
to
wear
even
after
trying
all
of
the
replacement
buds
that
come
with
it
my
husband
loved
to
travel
with
these
and
how
convenient
is
was
to
have
their
own
little
charging
dock
carrier
have
been
using
this
earphone
for
couple
days
and
have
to
say
it's
so
impressive
this
earphone
is
good
alternative
to
airpods
because
they
do
not
only
have
similar
functions
such
as
water
resistance,
fast
pairing,
but
also
the
appearance
is
cool
and
good
sound
quality
the
case
is
portable
battery
so
it's
very
convenient
for
my
long
days
at
school
to
sum
up,
i'm
satisfied
with
this
product
and
would
recommend
it
to
other
people
these
earphones
definitely
exceeded
my
expectations
pairing
is
simple,
sound
is
great,
and
the
earphones
actually
stay
in
your
ear
the
charging
case
is
amazingit
protects
and
charges
the
earphones
and
works
as
power
bank
to
charge
other
devices
this
is
great
product
at
great
price
give
this
product
stars
the
sound
quality
is
okay
the
charging
case
has
good
battery
capacity
reconnecting
with
paired
devices
is
as
easy
as
taking
taking
the
buds
out
of
the
casethe
right
ear
bud
stopped
charging
so
either
the
case
malfunctioned
of
the
right
ear
bud
did
anyway,
contacted
customer
service
and
they
helped
me
get
new
one's
quickly
great
product
and
service
i've
tried
several
bluetooth
earbuds
in
similar
price
range,
and
these
are
my
favorite
by
far,
mainly
because
of
the
battery
life
both
the
earbuds
and
the
charging
pack
hold
there
power
for
long
time
when
i'm
working
out
the
earbuds
actually
stay
in
my
ears,
which
is
nice,
and
last
the
whole
workout
the
sound
quality
isn't
the
best,
but
it
is
good
enough
and
has
enough
bass
to
keep
me
happy
overall
purchased
this
earbuds
for
my
iphone
xs
like
this
product
because
it
has
decent
appearance
the
sound
quality
is
also
excellent
it
works
perfectly
on
my
smartphone
highly
recommend
very
poor
quality
product
the
sound
volume
slowly
lowers
over
time
until
you
can
barely
hear
anything
experienced
this
problem
with
two
separate
pairs
of
these
earbuds
after
had
my
first
pair
replaced
after
my
second
pair
failed,
emailed
the
seller
asking
for
refund
on
their
poor
quality
and
unusable
product
and
was
stonewalled
do
not
buy
it
is
garbage
don't
stay
in
my
ear
charging
case
doesn't
stay
charged
long
indicator
burned
out
got
these
about
months
ago
and
love
them
use
then
at
work,
at
school,
and
when
work
out
they're
discreet,
they
don't
slip
out
and
the
sound
quality
is
very
great
in
my
opinion
they're
very
convenient
had
an
issue
with
the
battery
life
but
they
charge
very
quickly
so
was
not
upset
with
it
they
come
with
little
pouch,
extra
differently
shaped
ear
buds
for
all
kinds
of
ears
over
all
think
they're
great
and
worth
the
price
mostly
used
these
for
listening
to
music
while
working
at
desk
sound
quality
is
decent,
but
not
very
loud
after
month,
max
volume
on
my
phone
was
still
somewhat
quiet
through
the
headphones
seems
like
they're
quickly
getting
quieter
and
quieter
the
case
holds
significantly
less
charge
than
when
first
purchased
overall,
for
the
money
they're
not
bad,
just
not
build
to
last
bought
these
for
my
partner
and
she
loves
them
and
the
charging
station
which
she
used
to
charge
her
phone
the
product
with
good
price
effective
sound
quality
with
satisfied
battery
life
the
blue
light
is
enough
to
look
at
comfortable
and
impressed
started
listening
and
it
takes
about
more
than
hours
and
there
is
still
battery
in
it
small
case
and
small
to
put
in
pocket
or
purse
sounds
quality
is
average
and
expected
for
the
price
but
the
buds
are
too
big
for
me
and
it's
dropped
off
from
the
ears
it's
good
for
home
use
but
would
not
recommend
wearing
it
for
exercise
or
in
situation
that
creates
too
much
motion
such
as
turning
of
the
head
this
product
claims
it
is
water
proof
despite
initial
connectivity
issues,
after
using
it
in
the
shower,
it
became
much
less
loud
on
full
blast,
it
sounds
quite
quiet
listen
to
all
sorts
of
music,
including
metal
listening
to
anything,
especially
high
energy
music,
is
very
disappointing
these
are
good
fitting
and
good
quality,
but
not
in
regards
to
being
waterproof
these
worked
well
for
month
then
they
would
not
equalize
anymore
the
left
ear
was
much
softer
than
the
right
it
made
it
difficult
to
listen
to
anything
had
pair
that
were
returned
for
the
same
issue
and
was
sent
replacement
the
new
pair
lasted
bit
longer
before
going
bad
but
we
re
only
good
for
few
months
the
earbuds
they
come
with
are
useless
replaced
with
another
set
and
they
re
perfect
the
sound
is
goodthe
battery
life
isnt
great
hours
maybe
hours
of
usethey
might
make
your
ears
sore
after
while
because
they
are
hard
plastic
like
the
noise
canceling
aspect
of
the
headphones,
but
prefer
more
bass
in
my
music
they
are
very
comfortable
to
wear
and
stay
in
well
haven't
had
chance
to
test
them
at
the
gym
yet
but
so
far
so
good
easily
paired
with
my
phone,
and
came
with
charge
great
product,
better
than
expected
quick
activation
for
use
and
easy
sync
with
device
great
features
for
use
including
song
advance/skip,
pause,
and
volume
control
all
within
the
earbuds
themselves
only
wish
that
had
slighter
higher
volume
threshold
i've
had
these
for
two
months
now
and
they
work
great,
no
problems
at
all
they
are
not
the
best
for
picking
up
your
voice
for
phone
call,
but
knew
that
going
in
bought
them
for
working
out
and
for
that,
they're
perfect
got
headphones
and
they
were
better
than
expected
great
fit
and
sweat
proof
use
it
daily
in
gym
and
it
has
great
battery
life
too
would
definitely
recommend
it
loved
these
earbuds
wore
them
running,
working
out,
etc
no
issues,
but
the
case
stopped
charging
about
month
in
contacted
pasonomi
and
they
sent
replacement
set
was
excited
as
had
two
pairs
that
worked
now
but
soon
enough
one
pair's
right
earbud's
sound
started
to
fade
and
eventually
died
the
new
set
also
had
the
same
issue
in
about
month
of
use
have
them
at
max
volume
and
the
right
ear
bud
sound
level
is
barely
audible
they're
too
quiet
for
running/working
out
now
and
can't
use
either
set
:/
i'm
past
the
return
window,
otherwise
i'd
send
them
back
love
these
earbuds
sound
quality
is
great
and
the
battery
lasts
long
time
comes
with
nece
case
and
various
inserts
to
change
the
size
as
needed
to
fit
your
ear
had
an
issue
and
customer
service
resolved
it
promptly
buy
these
actually
am
so
surprised
for
the
price
how
well
these
head
phones
have
performed
am
procrastinator
which
in
turn
comes
hand
in
hand
with
"forgetting"
to
do
things
such
as
charge
my
head
phones
but
the
battery
life
on
these
is
so
good
it
doesn't
matter
if
forget
on
purpose
can
rest
assured
it's
still
gonna
be
good
day
with
music
in
my
ears
update:
they
did
fit
well
and
eventually
just
started
falling
out
as
i've
said
before
callers
cannot
hear
you
very
well
the
charge
is
short
wish
could
have
returned
themthey
fit
well
your
caller
cannot
hear
you
very
well
most
of
the
time
you'll
find
yourself
talking
loudly
sound
quality
is
ok
when
listening
to
music
dies
pretty
quickly
and
makes
this
funky
shuttering
noise
before
disconnecting
on
its
own
used
for
outdoor
activities
mostly
dislike
the
most:
the
tapping
of
the
touch
controls
seems
really
sensitive
and
when
simply
placing
in
the
ear,
the
controls
will
change
like
the
most:
simple
fact
they're
wireless
and
feels
great
in
the
ear
they
don't
feel
big,
bulky
or
heavy
in
the
ear
when
wearing
ears
don't
sweat
either
with
them
in
this
wireless
earbuds
sound
amazing
and
they
fit
comfortable
in
my
ears
from
the
moment
took
them
out
of
the
box
the
sync
with
my
iphone
unfortunately
the
right
ear
bud
doesn
not
work
anymore
so
can
only
use
the
left
earbud
sucks,
because
really
loved
them
wish
could
rate
because
they
are
better
than
my
apple
ear
buds
sound
wise
unfortunately
can
these
babies
are
just
as
good,
if
not
better,
than
lot
of
the
leading
wireless
headphones
out
there
quality
sound
and
the
built
in
battery
pack
makes
it
so
you
rarely
have
to
worry
about
charging
it
the
quality
of
sound
is
very
impressive
for
the
price
you
re
paying
it
ama
can
complain
about
thatit
really
good
for
working
out
it
will
not
fall
down
from
runningso
far
am
very
much
enjoying
them
and
look
forward
to
much
more
use
you
only
have
to
wait
minutes
for
charge
they
go
into
the
box
to
be
charged
overall
very
good
product
easy
to
connect,
good
fit,
good
sound
the
quality
of
sound
is
better
for
music
then
it
is
for
phone
calls
but
still
recommend
the
product
directions
little
hard
to
follow
but
ultimately
figured
it
out
don't
normally
wear
earbuds,
because
they
are
usually
too
big
for
my
ears,
but
these
fit
great
the
instructions
were
easy
to
follow
and
began
using
them
immediately
the
fit
is
great
and
it
comes
with
bag
of
extra
rubber
covers
it
was
like
surround
sound
in
my
ears
when
watched
movie
the
case
is
compact
enough
to
carry
in
my
purse
highly
recommend
these
earbuds
it
works
without
having
to
fiddle
with
anything
it's
comfortable
don't
like
that
if
you
don't
use
it
for
few
days,
the
charge
runs
out
even
if
you
keep
it
in
the
case
so
you
just
end
up
having
to
charge
it
again
before
even
getting
to
use
it
one
of
the
favorite
features
of
these
earbuds
are
the
high
quality
sound
it
sounds
way
better
than
any
of
the
other
wireless
ones
i've
tried
there
is
decent
amount
of
noise
cancellation
when
you
put
the
earbuds
on
because
of
the
way
the
cling
to
the
ear
battery
life
is
also
excellent
and
they
charge
in
the
case,
which
also
serves
as
charging
station
for
other
electronics
via
usb
cable
all
in
all
an
excellent
buy
these
headphones
worked
well
when
first
got
them
they
had
relatively
good
sound
quality,
had
good
range
and
had
handy
charging
case
however,
out
of
no
where,
on
my
first
pair,
the
left
headphone
seemed
to
die
out
so
it
reached
maximum
volume
of
what
sounded
like
lower
than
the
first
bar
of
volume
you
would
get
on
an
iphone
got
replacement
pair
because
did
like
the
product
and
the
same
thing
happened
with
the
right
headphone
within
week
and
half
with
that
said
do
not
buy
this
product
unless
you
are
willing
to
pay
$0
week
very
disappointed
would
love
to
love
these
earbuds,
but
can
the
sound
quality
is
great,
and
the
fit
is
great,
but
there
is
huge
design
flaw
have
been
through
sets
of
these,
and
they
all
break
the
same
way
the
recharging
pins
eventually
slip
into
the
case
just
little
bit,
and
no
longer
will
recharge
or
turn
off
the
ear
buds
customer
service
has
been
good
in
replacing
them
quickly
but
after
the
0rd
pair
bit
the
dust
give
up
have
trouble
finding
ear
buds
to
fit
my
ears
with
out
falling
out,
these
fit
perfect
and
don
have
to
worry
with
always
pushing
them
back
in
am
so
happy
to
finally
have
wireless
ear
buds
that
work
for
me
the
sound
is
good
quality
and
when
talking
to
people
on
the
phone
they
can
hear
you
and
you
don
have
trouble
hearing
them
as
well
the
case
feels
little
cheap
because
the
lack
of
magnetic
closure
the
pairing
is
sometimes
little
wonky
and
requires
you
to
remove
both
earbuds
from
the
case
quickly
so
they
pair
together
sound
quality
is
mediocre
and
find
have
to
turn
it
up
quite
high
sometimes
the
connection
also
cuts
out
sporadically,
but
overall
decent
product
for
the
price
these
bluetooth
ear
buds
fit
comfortably
and
like
how
it
states
they
are
synced
when
you
fist
put
them
in
and
say
synced
to
my
device
sound
quality
is
good
and
the
battery
life
is
pretty
long
great
product
you
get
what
you
pay
for,
if
you're
expecting
bose
quality
sound
for
this
pricemove
on
they
are
easy
to
connect
and
the
battery
life
is
excellent
sweat
like
madman
at
the
gym
and
these
haven't
even
come
close
to
coming
out
of
my
ears
didn
like
these
at
all
sound
quality
for
me
personally
is
horrible
no
bass
tone
in
music
used
to
hearing
bass
in
other
headphones
and
speakers
the
sounds
using
these
headphones
are
as
if
you
re
in
tin
can
not
worth
the
price
think
you
re
paying
more
for
the
charging
unit
which
doubles
as
power
bank
than
quality
wireless
headphones
lost
out
on
$0
having
to
ship
them
back
but
oh
well,
lesson
learned
after
using
these
earbuds
for
about
week
must
say
that
am
very
impressed
the
storage/
charging
box
is
awesome
put
them
in
there
when
you
are
finished
and
you
never
have
to
worry
about
losing
them
or
keeping
them
charged
used
them
at
the
gym
and
had
no
issues
with
them
falling
out
while
running
and
lifting
sweat
does
not
seem
to
be
an
issue
either
they
also
fit
very
comfortably
in
your
ear
overall
an
awesome
product
highly
recommend
they
are
very
comfortable,
the
battery
life
is
amazing
and
they
have
pretty
good
range
as
well
my
husband
used
them
while
mowing
the
lawn
and
they
didn't
budge
would
buy
these
again
as
gifts
for
the
price
you
can't
find
better
productonly
downside
is
the
voice
control
feature
only
works
with
siri
and
not
with
any
google/android
voice
control
its
good
like
it
the
sound
is
good
good
sound
quality
and
good
for
hand
free
good
for
talk
on
the
phone
and
listen
music
work
hour
shifts
and
am
literally
writing
this
sitting
in
my
truck
because
am
upset
fully
charged
and
battery
dying
only
after
hours
of
work,
no
bass
only
nice
thing
is
the
wireless
feel
duped
these
fit
good,
sound
great,
and
connect
quickly
battery
could
be
little
longer
but
nothing
compared
to
how
well
they
work
earbuds
feel
heavy
and
do
not
fit
my
ears
:
used
the
smallest
size
pads
and
they
still
fall
out,
all
the
timei
will
say
the
construction
seems
solid
though;
one
fell
out
of
my
ear
into
sink
full
of
water
and
still
worked
surprised
they
fit
in
my
little
ears
thought
the
left
ear
piece
wasn
working
but
it
was
from
not
removing
the
plastic
from
ear
bud
remove
them
and
they
re
simple
to
sync
currently
leaning
the
where/how
to
tap
for
music
control
these
are
great
headphones
for
$0
they
are
not
$0
and
don't
expect
$0
sound
battery
life
is
good,
get
about
hours
depending
on
volume
before
have
to
charge
them
in
the
case
the
case
will
charge
the
ear
buds
many
many
times
before
needing
charging
itself
sound
quality
is
great
as
long
as
you
can
get
good
fit
it
it's
not
sealed
in
your
ear
there
is
lack
of
bass
overall
they
are
well
worth
the
$0
price
point
this
product
is
awesome,
the
good
thing
is
what
we
can
use
the
both
earbuds
with
different
devices
but
make
sure
you
do
not
pair
each
other
very
nice
product
have
been
using
these
earbuds
on
daily
bases
for
the
past
months
and
have
to
say
they
work
great
they
are
very
comfortable
and
stay
in
your
ears
use
them
running
and
they
stay
in
your
ears
and
don't
move
at
all
the
sound
quality
is
great
also
great
the
only
thing
that
would
say
is
lacking
is
using
then
to
talk
on
the
phone
the
majority
of
people
talk
to
say
it
sounds
muffled
but
for
the
price
you
can't
beat
it
when
first
received
these,
they
were
great
they
lasted
0+
hours
on
single
charge
two
months
later,
the
ear
buds
barely
last
an
hour
and
half
on
full
charge
was
hoping
for
better
quality
but
guess
you
get
what
you
pay
for
at
$0
the
earbuds
fit
into
my
ear
and
worked
well
for
my
workouts
sound
quality
was
average,
and
the
max
volume
was
limited
after
year
of
constant
usage
the
right
bud
stopped
producing
audible
sounds,
so
am
stuck
listening
to
mono
complete
piece
of
garbage
star
only
because
it
works
the
biggest
rubber
pads
are
too
small,
sound
quality
is
very
poor
and
very
quiet
too
bought
it
to
listen
to
music/podcast
in
the
gym
and
can't
really
hear
anything
loud
enoughfeel
bad
throwing
my
money
away
like
that
:
have
own
an
apple
ipods
and
kept
loosing
them
while
doing
simple
movements
,
exercising,
riding
bike
and
finally
lost
one
decided
to
find
something
different
and
purchased
twsx0
on
amazon
those
headphones
are
reasonably
priced
with
great
sound
and
amazing
battery
life
they
connect
automatically
anytime
you
take
them
out
of
the
case
and
fit
my
ear
as
it
should
love
them
and
you
will
too
they
are
very
comfortable
use
them
for
conference
calls
as
well
as
listening
to
music
when
run
bought
these
for
my
girlfriend
and
as
they
are
good
headphones
,
they
did
not
quite
fit
her
ear
canal
as
snug
as
we
wanted
it
to,
if
you
have
like
small
ears
they
may
not
fit
as
comfortable
as
you
would
like
but
we
gave
them
to
friend
and
he
absolutely
loves
them
love
these
earbuds,
got
them
because
was
tired
of
the
traditional
wired
earbuds
would
always
short
getting
used
to
the
functions
of
these
was
super
easy,
and
the
sound
is
really
good
as
long
as
you
used
the
right
ear
fitting
best
budget
wireless
earbuds
i've
ever
bought
got
these
to
wear
while
doing
yard
work
they
work
great
and
haven't
had
any
issues
with
them
everything
is
perfect
that
exactly
what
want
no
so
expensive
but
good
quality
all
functions
are
good
choose
wireless
products
because
drive
lot
it
also
very
convenient
for
charging
the
battery
capacity
is
enough
for
several
times
don
need
to
charge
it
every
day
the
earbuds
would
never
turn
off
the
button
wouldn't
turn
on
or
off
asked
for
help
but
they
suggested
ireinstall
them
tried
that,
and
trues
holding
the
button
for
long
time
idk
if
got
bad
ones
or
what
cuz
hear
great
reviews
but
this
left
bitter
taste
in
my
mouth
well
didn
spend
lot
on
these,
but
hoped
they
wud
last
longer
than
these
did
the
right
side
is
so
low
it
almost
intelligible
they
sounded
great
until
about
month
ago
longevitywise
wouldn
get
them
but
when
they
did
work
they
sounded
good
and
fit
great
these
headphones
sound
good,
they
stay
in
the
ear
well
and
they
have
great
battery
life
they
are
bit
uncomfortable
for
me
after
while,
but
am
kind
of
sensitive,
so
it
might
just
be
me
may
aairhut
a0s
never
bothered
me
like
this,
but
they
had
half
the
battery
life,
and
didn't
stay
in
the
ear
quite
as
well
think
the
secure
ear
position
is
the
trade
off
for
the
discomfort
drop
these
in
boiling
water
one
time
and
nothing
even
happened
to
them
perfect
quality,
and
easy
to
function
just
wish
the
battery
lasted
little
longer
very
pleased
with
purchase
headphones
are
comfortable
and
very
loud
would
recommend
to
anyone
at
this
price
i've
had
these
ear
buds
for
over
month
now,
and
give
them
star
rating
bcuz
the
call
quality
is
good,
yet
the
sound
quality
while
playing
music
is
poor
there's
hardly
any
bass
when
playing
music,
and
if
you
do
find
way
to
increase
the
bass
sound
thru
your
device,
the
ear
buds
will
distort
they
do
have
comfortable
fit,
and
the
battery
life
is
great
again,
great
for
voice
calls,
but
not
great
for
listening
to
music
it's
great
product
dont
get
me
wrong
the
sound
is
amazing
the
comfort
with
running
only
problem
is
you
might
have
to
charge
it
after
0/0
hours
they
fit
well
in
my
ear
and
do
not
fall
out
like
other
products
battery
life
on
the
earbuds
about
hours
and
the
case
will
last
long
long
time
on
recharges
these
earbuds
are
honestly
great
for
music
have
sensitive
ears
that
hurt
with
other
well
known
brands
and
took
chance
on
these
after
reading
some
reviews
and
am
not
disappointed
super
easy
to
pair,
very
comfortable
and
fit
perfectly
in
my
ears
the
touch
pads
work
well
on
both
sides
and
who
could
complain
with
price
like
this
will
definitely
be
recommending
to
my
friends
and
family
really
liked
these
earbuds,
but
after
while
noticed
that
my
calls
kept
on
getting
disturbed
with
screeching
noise
and
couldn
hear
anything
first
thought
it
was
bcz
the
battery
was
dying,
but
even
after
fully
charging
the
device
it
continues
to
have
the
same
disturbance
usually
have
to
disconnect
bluetooth
in
order
to
continue
with
my
call
which
is
very
annoyingother
than
that
sound
is
very
good
and
can
choose
to
use
one
earbud
or
both
or
even
share
earbuds
with
each
other
bcz
each
earbud
has
its
own
bluetooth
connection
too
good
earbuds
but
not
good
enough
they
sound
ok
surprised
that
they
didnt
sound
as
good
as
other
earphones,
mids
were
clear
but
lows
and
highs
were
dampened
despite
other
eartips,
they
still
didnt
sound
good
even
with
good
seal
they
connected
very
well,
no
lost
connection
the
fit
was
hard
to
the
touch
you
can
feel
the
plastic
returned
for
felt
they
were
not
worth
the
money
as
compared
to
other
tws
ive
tried
love
these
earbuds
and
the
case
the
case
not
only
recharge
the
earbuds
but
it
can
also
charge
your
phone
or
any
other
device
with
usb
plug
the
earbuds
charge
only
last
about
and
half
hours
then
you
ll
have
to
pop
them
back
in
charging
case
but
the
case
charge
last
loooong
time
good
sound
all
around
good
earbuds
phone
conversations
are
better
than
expected
from
other
reviews
haven't
tested
the
waterproof
claim
yet
purchased
these
earbuds
in
march
0,
and
was
really
excited
to
use
them
for
few
months,
they
worked
well
and
gave
decent
sound
quality
then,
the
left
earbud
stopped
working,
and
nothing
has
fixed
the
issue
if
these
were
still
working,
would
have
given
stars,
but
for
$0,
they
shouldn't
break
in
less
than
days
bought
these
for
my
dad
for
his
birthday
didn
try
them
out
personally
but
he
said
they
were
greatuntil
one
of
the
headphones
stopped
working
only
after
month
called
customer
service
and
they
sent
us
brand
new
set
for
free
haven
had
any
issues
since
not
high
tech
type
person,
but
was
looking
forward
to
these
wireless
bluetooth
earphones
found
them
to
be
somewhat
comfortable
in
my
ears,
but
could
be
better
found
the
sound
quality
to
be
excellent
used
them
for
biking
and
the
treadmill,
and
they
worked
out
perfect
battery
life
and
carrying
case
are
perfect
overall
would
recommend
this
product
these
are
awesome
and
have
made
yard
and
house
work
tolerable
get
these
for
the
podcast
listener
in
your
life
works
awesome
even
on
the
mower
purchased
these
to
try
out
wireless
ear
piece
the
sound
quality
is
mostly
treble
can
live
with
that
don
use
headphones
much,
but
sometimes
you
need
them
what
found
with
this
product,
was
even
when
you
pause
the
ear
buds,
have
them
in
their
case
and
they
are
in
my
back
pack,
they
activate
when
text,
email,
phone
call
comes
in
you
do
not
hear
the
tone
for
text
or
email
have
to
forget
this
device
and
reset
it
up
when
want
to
use
the
earbuds
that
is
contrary
to
what
is
stated
in
the
user
guide
great
product
with
great
connection
and
sound
quality
has
better
range
for
connection
then
my
other
pair
battery
life
is
not
the
best,
but
still
above
standard
it
also
charges
fast
and
you
can
use
the
charging
dock
as
battery
bank
for
other
devices
fits
perfect
&
very
comfortable
on
my
ear
easy
pair
and
to
connect
every
time
that
need
to
use,
plus
that
have
small
power
bank
to
put
some
juice
to
my
phone
but
the
more
important
this
ear
buds
sounds
great
this
things
are
awesome
they
stay
on
my
ear
even
while
running
battery
life
is
really
good,
and
the
charging
port
lasts
long
time
nice
design
and
quality
they
were
easy
to
connect
and
are
very
clear
sounding
also
like
the
feature
that
it
tells
me
when
am
receiving
phone
call
on
my
cell
overall
great
product
and
can't
wait
to
use
on
my
trip
great
earbuds
don't
hurt
my
ears
and
fit
they
were
awesome
would
purchase
again
always
trust
amazon's
qualities
have
received
it
almost
weeks,awesome
sound
quality,
easy
connect
to
my
phone,
compared
with
the
one
my
wife
purchase
more
than
$0,
this
one
is
way
more
better
received
these
earphones
just
today
and
couldn't
hold
back
from
writing
reviewthey
are
too
good,
what
like
the
most
is
there
interface,
connectivity
and
comfort
it
suits
for
sports
and
is
comfortable
around
the
ear
the
design
is
great
also,
the
connectivity
is
really
simple
and
easy
can
recommend
this
to
anybody
without
doubt
very
comfortable
to
put
in
my
ear,
sync
to
my
phone
automatically
pretty
good
sound
quality
battery
life
could
be
bit
better,
but
it's
expected
from
small
earbud
comes
with
power
bank
which
is
huge
plus
also
can
serve
as
backup
power
bank
for
my
phone
definitely
recommend
great
quality
and
good
sound
they
were
extremely
comfortable
to
wear
for
long
periods
of
time
would
highly
recommend
these
earbuds
for
anyone
looking
for
reliable
wireless
product
have
been
very
happy
with
these
the
wireless
headphones
are
very
easy
to
set
up
and
pair
with
my
phone
they
are
comfortable
and
the
sound
quality
listening
to
music
is
great
much
better
then
the
wired
headphones
was
previously
using
easy
to
set
up
and
use
great
sound
quality
and
comfortable
fitthese
are
my
first
wireless
earbuds,
and
they've
been
fantastic
so
far
i've
only
used
them
to
listen
to
music
from
my
phone,
so
can't
weigh
in
on
things
like
phone
calls,
but
they've
been
great
in
the
capacity
i've
used
them
would
recommend
definitely
recommend
these
easy
to
set
up,
the
quality
is
amazing,
they
even
give
you
extra
ear
pieces
and
carry
bag
very
simple
instructions
to
pair
with
your
phone
and
for
the
price
cant
go
wrong
:d
love
them
the
quality
of
the
earbuds
are
amazing,
it
arrived
really
quick
and
was
well
packed,
it
came
with
extra
size
buds
which
is
amazingi
love
the
fact
that
can
charge
it
in
it's
box
and
the
ease
of
usei
would
definitely
reccomend
you
to
buy
it,
it's
the
best
option
if
you
are
looking
for
wireless
earbuds
look
no
more
ve
been
through
two
pairs
in
under
year,
same
problem
both
times;
the
right
earbud
stops
connecting
but
still
gets
power
the
left
still
connects
but
only
getting
audio
on
ear
sucks
so
beware
buying
these
earbuds,
have
bought
these
and
had
to
get
replacement
pair
and
the
replacement
pair
did
the
same
thing
as
the
other
ones
at
first
they
sound
great,
but
within
weeks
the
audio
faded
away
and
you
could
barley
hear
your
music
playing
these
suck
and
will
never
buy
anything
from
this
company
again
just
returned
my
replacement
pair
going
back
to
my
other
brand
that
had
bought
before
these
they
never
let
me
down
my
wife
and
both
have
set
of
these,
white
and
black,
and
we
both
love
them
the
sound
is
great
the
ability
to
pair
them
with
my
phone
and
my
laptop
at
the
same
time
has
come
in
very
handy
the
battery
life
is
awesome,
and
they
are
very
comfortable
to
wear
and
fit
snugly
so
no
need
to
worry
about
them
falling
out
highly
recommend
them
love
them
buttttt
when
i'm
watching
on
line
the
movie
stops
all
the
time
and
the
second
set
is
delayed
the
movie
from
the
sound
and
that's
very
annoying
the
bud
itself
the
silicone
part
that
goes
into
the
ear
is
too
soft
and
flat
rather
than
rounded,
so
it
allows
too
much
external
sound
into
the
ear
while
it
stays
in
throughout
workout,
it's
not
as
snug
also,
the
loudest
volume
isn't
all
that
loud
great
bluetooth
wireless
easy
to
pair,
battery
life
is
great
too
excellent
for
the
price
did
not
expect
to
be
so
great
compare
so
many
product
in
the
market
for
way
higher
price
exactly
the
headphones
was
looking
for
the
sound
is
great
and
the
case
carries
great
charge
love
the
fact
that
you
can
use
them
independently
of
each
other,
also
the
instructions
are
clear
and
precise
was
looking
for
good
set
of
bluetooth
earbuds
so
ordered
these
and
the
quality
of
them
has
been
great
was
really
impressed
with
the
bluetooth
range
of
these
which
is
much
better
than
some
larger
bluetooth
speakers
have
they
feel
great
in
my
ears
as
well
did
have
problem
with
them
initially
but
this
company
has
great
customer
service
and
took
care
of
me
like
was
their
#0
customer
highly
recommend
very
good
quality
for
this
price
ve
been
using
these
earphones
for
working
out
ever
since
got
them
they
fit
my
ears
perfectly
the
unit
is
little
big
for
my
ears
so
they
don
seat
well
battery
lasts
hours
max
wet
hair
activates
the
touch
controls
and
after
months
the
right
one
died
it
very
easy
to
pair
with
my
iphone
the
battery
lasts
for
over
hours
also
like
the
power
bank
case,
which
is
convenient
to
carry
on
the
black
color
makes
it
unnoticeable,
even
in
the
office
buying
these
budget
friendly
earbuds,
did
not
expect
amazing
sound
quality
or
anything
extraordinary
however,
the
faulty
fundamentals
ultimately
led
me
to
return
these
bad
boys
experience
based
on
trial
of
little
over
week
observances
include:
right
and
left
channel
does
not
maintain
connection
and
would
only
play
out
of
one
earbud,
always
hassle
to
establish
bluetooth
connection,
scrambled
signal
in
busy
areas
earbuds
stay
in
place
while
running
charger
case
is
plus
dislike
am
prone
to
vertigo
after
about
week
of
wearing
these
noticed
severe
vertigo
and
also
very
sensitive
hearing
am
sensitive
to
noises
now
that
have
never
been
in
my
life
please
do
more
research
prior
to
selling
any
more
of
this
product
have
not
been
wearing
for
weeks
and
my
hearing
has
not
returned
to
normal
yet
am
concerned
about
any
long
term
damage
earbuds
produce
very
good
sound
and
volume
goes
pretty
high
unlike
other
earbuds
i've
bought
the
right
bud
gave
out
after
several
months,
but
customer
service
was
great
and
sent
me
new
pair
simple
pairing
and
buds
seem
to
be
quite
waterproof
bonus
feature
is
the
charging
case,
which
has
the
ability
to
serve
as
backup
battery
for
my
phone
the
sound
quality
and
battery
life
is
far
superior
than
others
and
it
is
really
helpful
during
calls
it
has
the
ear
phone
at
time
accessibility
and
it
is
perfect
product
for
this
price
just
try
it
once
to
know
it
is
the
best
at
this
pricethe
support
team
responds
really
fast
in
case
of
any
issuesi
had
issue
with
sound
one
right
ear
due
to
wax
settling
and
they
helped
with
the
right
solutionthe
sound
quality
is
really
really
good
don't
hesitate
and
buy
it
sound
quality
is
great
on
these
paired
easily
to
my
phone
and
held
battery
life
for
good
while
charge
easily
in
the
provided
case
too
very
good
quality
and
fit
comfortably
i've
used
these
for
about
weeks
now
don't
really
have
any
negatives
range
on
them
it
is
pretty
good
haven't
had
the
battery
die
while
wearing
for
about
hours
quality
of
them
all
around
is
good
they
stay
in
my
ears
the
entire
time
i'm
running,
they've
gotten
slightly
wet
and
no
problems
the
earbuds
work
great
with
my
mobile
phone
butthe
volume
up/down
does
*not*
work
with
my
fitbit
versa,
even
after
the
seller
giving
feedback
to
try
sokinda
frustrating
on
that
point
which
is
why
gave
only
stars
overall
the
seller
was
quite
prompt
in
their
replies
to
me
except
for
my
last
response
otherwise,
really
like
the
earbuds
the
earphones
are
great
they
were
very
easy
to
pair
and
fit
well
in
my
ear,
even
when
running
the
sound
quality
is
great
they
come
in
nice
box
and
are
easy
to
charge
would
highly
recommend
them
bought
these
earbuds
for
running
and
going
to
the
gym
as
my
apple
airpods
are
often
falling
out
while
running
the
build
quality
is
pretty
great
for
its
price,
and
they
have
ipx0
water
protection
which
is
great
on
long
run,
now
i'm
not
afraid
of
sweat
getting
inside
the
earbuds
decided
to
cut
the
cord
and
go
wireless
was
worried
as
several
pairs
had
tried
in
the
past
hurt
the
inside
of
my
ear
these
are
not
only
painless,
but
great
sound
quality
too
they
can
cancel
out
outside
noise
or
can
turn
the
volume
down
where
can
hear
surrounding
sounds
without
compromising
the
quality
of
my
music
have
worn
them
to
work
out,
clean
my
house
and
bake,
i'm
in
love
absolutely
horrible
they
sound
ok
but
no
bass
but
after
month
they
dont
connect
as
pair
anymore
they
pair
as
individual
so
only
one
works
at
time
no
good
going
back
to
regular
plug
ins
not
good
for
traveling
in
car
or
airp
look
airplane
very
difficult
to
listen
so
i've
had
these
for
about
months
now
and
i'm
not
too
happy
they
worked
great
for
little
while
but
then
that
changed
headphone
batteries
only
last
about
hrs
the
right
side
always
try's
to
disconnect
and
reconnect
and
if
my
phone
is
in
my
pocket
opposite
the
left
ear
piece
the
one
that
actually
connects
to
phone
my
music
goes
on
and
out
non
stop
now
come
yesterday
my
case
is
starting
to
seperate
idk
if
would
waste
this
amount
of
money
on
these
again
didn
work
very
well,
dropped
slot
of
calls,
went
dead
quick
these
bluetooth
headphones
really
sound
amazing
the
battery
life
has
been
great
so
far
lasting
my
entire
workday
like
to
wear
one
earbud
so
can
hear
what
going
on
in
the
office
while
still
listening
to
music
or
audiobooks
while
do
my
data
entry
work
it
small
and
discreet
and
so
convenient
with
no
wires
the
sound
quality
was
not
good
at
all
wish
could
send
them
back
but
ordered
them
as
christmas
gift
these
were
delivered
in
couple
days
and
were
not
ordered
on
prime
comfortable
buds
easy
connection
to
iphone
you
can
connect
one
or
both
like
the
charging
pad
and
option
to
charge
my
phone
good
sound
quality
one
of
the
best
until
they
just
stopped
working
after
months
bad
do
not
buy
they
only
let
the
right
bud
work
as
single
for
the
cost,
would
have
expected
better
battery
charge
less
than
hours
so
far
am
pretty
impressed
with
tbis
product
the
shipping
was
quick,
it
came
with
very
clear
instructions
it
paired
with
my
phone
super
easily
what
liked
most
was
it
came
with
two
sets
of
different
sized
ear
pieces
so
you
have
all
kinds
of
options
to
find
the
right
size
for
your
ear
and
spare
is
set
sound
quality
was
good
and
could
turn
it
up
quite
loud
over
all
very
happy
with
this
product
i've
noticed
the
batteries
dont
last
as
long
as
thought
they
would
other
then
that
they
are
great
these
earbuds
are
comfortable
enough,
sound
is
very
clear
and
can
be
loud
too
the
bass
is
surprisingly
better
than
was
expecting,
awesome
connection
was
easy,
and
yes
you
can
play
one
earbud
at
time
while
not
using
the
other
:
material
is
sturdy
and
really
like
the
look
of
the
case,
especially
when
the
lights
are
glowing
inside
it
while
chargingso
far
customer
support
are
really
nice
and
fast
to
reply
thanks
for
the
awesome
product
well
worth
the
buy
those
headphones
are
working
great
very
easy
to
set
up
have
pair
of
airpods
but
they
don't
fit
in
my
ears
and
they
fall
off
easily
all
the
time
in
comparison,
these
headphones
fit
in
my
ears
very
well
and
they
don't
cause
any
discomfort
after
wearing
them
for
long
period
of
time
they
are
perfect
for
phone
calls
and
listening
to
music
when
working
and
exercising
love
the
fact
that
you
can
charge
them
in
the
case
and
the
case
lasts
about
week
however
recently
started
experiencing
intermittent
bluetooth
connectivity
issues
mainly
when
am
moving
around
at
the
gym
if
turn
my
head
or
bend
over
lose
connection
in
one
or
both
of
the
ear
buds
won't
buy
agaj
going
to
look
for
another
more
reliable
pair
sound
is
little
tinny
but
works
well
for
it's
intended
purpose
co
sent
me
another
set
as
the
first
one
did
not
work
at
al
good
customer
service
competitive
in
price,
but
air
pods
are
by
far
the
way
to
go
was
very
surprised
at
how
well
these
bluetooth
headphones
sounds
and
play
they
were
very
easy
to
pair
you
can't
beat
the
price
for
the
quality
am
running
earphones
every
morning
to
listen
to
music,
the
sound
quality
is
very
good,
no
noise,
the
battery
can
be
used
for
long
time,
lying
in
bed
at
night
to
watch
tv
will
not
quarrel
to
others,
have
to
buy
another
one
for
my
wife
only
use
these
for
audiobooks,
since
that's
all
really
listen
to,
but
they
work
great
for
that
the
connection
is
pretty
good
and
has
decent
range
sometimes
the
buds
get
out
of
sync
with
each
other
just
slightly,
which
is
frustrating,
but
at
$0
cheaper
than
the
premium
version,
think
these
are
great
deal
and
am
very
happy
they
stay
charged
for
long
time
too
the
charging
case
is
great
and
has
crazy
amount
of
battery
life
am
really
disappointed
in
my
purchase
these
turn
themselves
off,
but
it
seems
they
also
turn
themselves
on
bought
these
in
july,
and
have
used
them
only
handful
of
times
lot
of
the
times
went
to
use
them,
they
were
dead,
even
though
had
barely
used
them
now
they
won't
charge
what
waste
of
money
really
like
that
it
can
drown
out
even
the
loudest
screaming
of
my
birds
it
also
connects
to
my
tv
really
dont
like
how
you
cant
turn
it
on
if
you
dont
have
the
case,
mostly
cause
lost
the
case
this
morning
probably
not
good
lol
is
there
any
other
way
to
charge
these
just
in
case
also
suggest
making
the
case
bit
more
longer
and
flatter
than
taller
and
bulkier
am
giving
star
for
the
quality
received
for
the
given
price
it
has
been
more
than
months
and
it
is
working
ok
everything
works
fine,
but
ordered
black
pair
and
received
white
pair
instead,
so
took
off
one
star
it
fits
nicely
in
the
ear
and
it
connects
quickly
to
my
phone
the
part
that
is
bit
annoying
is
double
tapping
the
earphone
and
having
google
voice
pop
up
instead
of
the
next
music
playing
paired
up
as
soon
as
pulled
them
out
of
the
box
audio
is
great

and
nice
and
loud
fit
well
and
is
easy
to
change
the
earbud
tips
if
necessary
to
fit
your
ear
found
the
ability
to
control
these
to
be
bit
cumbersome
wish
there
was
an
interface
with
these
these
are
well
worth
the
money
long
battery
life,
awesome
sound,
comfortable
to
wear,
stay
in
place
during
workouts,
and
pair
easily
with
my
phone
very
pleased
these
wireless
earbuds
are
amazing
great
battery
life,
strong
reliable
connect,
and
good
audio
quality
was
not
disappointed
with
this
purchase
at
all
the
battery
life
is
proven
to
be
excellent
and
the
case
is
designed
to
charge
and
transport
the
earbuds
and
provides
an
excellent
way
to
recharge
other
devices
on
the
go
the
design
is
simple
and
easy
to
use
wanted
to
love
these
earbuds
was
so
excited
to
try
them
out,
but
minutes
into
using
them
the
sound
kept
stopping
it
would
mostly
happen
in
the
right
earbud,
but
started
happening
to
the
left
one
as
well
the
sound
would
skip
every
once
in
while
during
my
run,
very
frustratingi
got
home
and
charged
the
earbuds
overnight
thinking
maybe
low
battery
was
the
problem,
but
the
same
thing
happened
the
next
day
also
realized
they
run
out
of
battery
very
quickly
they
were
great
out
of
the
box
but
with
in
months
the
right
headphone
is
barely
making
sound
anymore,
like
the
volume
is
turned
down
on
it
i've
played
with
it
quiet
bit
but
can't
figure
out
how/if
it
can
be
fixed
the
price
and
value
are
beyond
my
expectations
the
sound
is
clear
and
crisp
you
can
even
enjoy
the
quality
utilizing
one
earbud
the
set
up
was
easy
as
it
connected
to
my
iphone
without
issue
and
remains
connected
have
small
ears
however
these
fit
perfectly
and
came
with
additional
sizes
can
get
through
whole
hour
shift
on
one
charge
earbuds
came
in
high
quality
looking
package,
with
secure
case
for
the
earbuds
the
battery
life
is
excellent,
only
charge
them
around
once
week
go
to
the
gym
times
week
they
re
great
for
high
intensity
workouts
and
they
fit
snug
into
your
ear
my
biggest
worry
was
that
they
fall
out
while
did
cross
fit
training,
but
they
haven
yet
and
they
re
very
comfortable
terrible
product
know
they
are
cheap,
but
expected
little
bit
better
than
got
the
sound
is
awful
with
no
bass
whatsoever
don
need
lot
of
bass,
but
there
should
be
somespotty
connection
unless
the
phone
is
up
near
your
head
when
my
phone
went
into
my
pocket,
the
connection
was
so
spotty
that
they
were
unusable
the
right
ear
bud
is
starting
not
to
work
the
sound
is
very
low
and
now
just
past
the
0day
return
period***update***the
manufacturer
contacted
to
resolve
the
issue
and
the
were
very
professional
and
made
the
experience
more
pleasant
as
customer
would
definitely
buy
from
them
again
they
replaced
the
defective
pair
so
now
will
be
trying
them
out
will
update
again
soon
these
earbuds
are
huge
am
female
and
have
reg/small
ears
these
were
giant,
didn't
fit
correctly
at
all
sound
not
good
they
would
fly
off
my
ear,
in
heartbeat,
if
used
them
during
exercise
very
disappointed
bought
it
for
my
brother
and
the
sound
of
the
headphones
is
horrible,
you
can
speak
on
the
phone
with
it
and
it
very
hard
to
connect
to
the
phone
at
first,
was
very
happy
with
this
product
easy
pairing
and
reasonable
sound
quality
however,
after
having
this
product
for
months
the
sound
quality
started
to
become
quieter
and
quieter
to
the
point
where
can
no
longer
use
these
headphones
while
exercise
would
recommend
buying
different
bluetooth
headphones
these
are
really
awesome
but
the
only
problem
had
was
they
aren
compatible
with
an
phone
so
had
to
use
someone
else
phone
they
did
link
up
quick
with
the
blue
tooth
sound
quality
is
amazing
would
highly
recommend
don
even
bother,
they
hardly
last
two
months
then
start
to
wear
down
the
earbuds
fit
snug
into
my
ears
and
cancel
noise
while
out
for
run
they
don
fall
out
or
feel
like
they
are
going
to
either
no
problems
connecting
them
to
my
phone
through
bluetooth
have
an
old
iphone
and
it
won
turn
on
even
if
connect
it
to
wall
outlet
because
the
battery
drains
so
quickly
but
if
connect
it
to
the
earbud
charger
it
does
turn
on
well
you
get
what
you
pay
for
these
earbuds
are
easy
to
use
and
connect
to
but
my
complain
is
the
sound
quality,
bought
these
because
of
all
the
other
reviews
about
how
great
the
sound
was
but
was
disappointed
no
bass
the
manual
has
no
instructions
on
how
to
adjust
audio
if
you
can
even
do
it
at
all
the
fit
is
not
bad
can
jog
with
them
just
going
to
use
these
until
can
buy
the
bose
earbuds
like
said
the
sound
sucks
on
these
ve
owned
beats
earpods
that
have
lot
of
bass
so
ve
grown
accustomed
to
that
these
don
have
any,
but
the
sound
quality
is
great
and
they
fit
perfectly
in
my
ear
these
headphones
are
not
worth
the
price
they
worked
one
day,
then
the
sound
quality
started
to
get
lower
and
lower
now
only
one
headphone
has
sound
and
the
other
you
can
barely
hear
it
the
battery
life
is
horrible
the
most
it
last
is
three
hours
if
you
work
long
nights
like
me
this
can
get
very
annoying
the
only
good
thing
is
the
bluetooth
range
is
pretty
far
and
doesn
buffer
but
still
these
headphones
suck
never
buying
anything
from
the
company
again
these
earbuds
are
sort
of
comfortable
but
the
sound
quality
is
just
bad
bass
is
pretty
much
absent
and
you
have
to
turn
the
volume
all
the
way
up
to
hear
anything
returned
for
refund
when
got
this
product
loved
it
but
after
week
the
right
one
stopped
charging
and
then
not
working
all
together
the
battery
life
is
ok
it
is
about
hours
for
me
and
they
are
itchy
don
know
how
to
explain
it
but
when
put
in
the
left
one
it
starts
to
itch
minutes
later
and
have
to
readjust
it
which
is
annoying
maybe
the
fact
that
i'm
just
coming
down
from
beats
studio
to
this
the
quality
of
sound
is
aweful,
but
otherwise
it's
good
it's
like
having
car
in
perfect
shape,
but
no
engine
the
concept
of
wireless
headphones
is
great,
but
this
pair
is
not
the
headphones
became
progressively
less
loud
with
each
use
despite
the
volume
being
turned
up
to
full
on
the
phone
and
headphones
they
do
nothing
to
block
out
noise
around
you
the
battery
life
isn
bad,
but
after
two
hours
they
die
go
somewhere
else
for
your
wireless
headphones
brought
these
thinking
they
were
great,
but
found
out
they
go
out
very
fast
the
charging
light
is
always
on
and
they
have
bad
static
in
them
when
talking
the
talk
time
is
terrible
and
you
have
to
recharge
after
about
minutes
do
not
recommend
this
product
save
your
money
best
earbud
purchase
have
ever
made
ve
had
more
expensive
that
did
not
work
as
well
as
these
do
use
them
everyday
had
to
return
the
first
set
received
because
both
earpieces
wouldn
pair
with
each
other
the
second
pair
received
worked
great
for
about
two
weeks,
but
now
once
again
only
one
earpiece
works
both
pieces
will
not
sync
or
pair
with
each
other
would
not
order
these
again
can
only
hear
sound
out
of
the
rh
earpiece
love
these
headphones
they
arrived
with
nearly
full
charge
and
paired
easily
once
read
the
instructions
only
couple
steps,
nothing
to
worry
about
the
sound
quality
is
significantly
better
than
expected
and
they
stay
in
my
ears
very
well
would
buy
again
love
these
earbuds,
clear
hearing,
good
sound
and
the
price
is
right
i've
been
looking
for
decent
pair
of
wireless
earbuds
for
while
now
and
these
popped
up
as
wellreviewed
product
so
decided
to
try
it
out
i'm
happy
to
say
they
fit
well
in
my
ear
and
don't
fall
out
during
exercises
they
also
allow
good
amount
of
distance
from
the
device
it's
connected
to
allowing
me
to
play
basketball
and
racquetball
without
losing
the
bluetooth
connection
sometimes
its
great
and
sometimes
its
really
bad
wouldn
spend
$0
on
it
this
product
is
great,
not
for
me
but
great
for
someone
that
cares
more
about
the
highs
and
mids
care
about
the
lows
love
bass
so
would
recommend
this
product
to
anyone
that
isn't
fan
of
bassfits
snug
and
comfortable
and
bulky
as
it
is
you
forget
you
have
them
on
after
awhile
these
were
great
buy
charge
up
the
case,
and
wear
the
ear
buds
for
hours
these
were
well
worth
what
paid
for
them
these
headphones
are
amazeballs
and
very
affordable
for
the
quality
it
sounds
great
with
both
music
and
phone
calls
have
small
ears
and
other
earbuds
either
fall
out
or
won't
sit
perfectly
in
my
ears,
but
these
fit
perfectly
fine
these
headphones
have
good
sound
are
quite
comfortable
and
have
decent
features
like
volume
up
or
downi
had
few
issues
with
them
but,
the
company
was
quick
to
reach
out
and
do
whatever
they
needed
to
make
me
happy
in
the
end
think
they're
great
value
for
money

great
sound
qualityi
highly
suggest
these
headphones
we
dont
leave
home
without
them
highly
suggest
spending
few
more
dollars
for
higher
quality
pair
of
earbuds
it
only
took
few
uses
for
the
screen
inside
the
earbuds
to
come
loose
threw
these
away
after
few
months
because
the
left
one
gave
out
the
sound
was
ok
these
earbuds
fit
perfectly
in
your
ear
the
battery
life
is
very
good
the
earbuds
come
in
cute
little
case
to
keep
them
in
and
the
case
can
charge
your
phone
in
pinch
wow
loves
these
new
headphones
they
connected
right
to
my
phone
in
no
time
at
all
the
sound
is
rich
&
full
us
love
that
can
adjust
the
volume
up
&
down
pause
songs
as
well
as
skip
foward
or
back
all
just
by
tapping
one
of
the
ear
plugs
had
some
issues
with
the
first
one,
but
great
customer
service
sent
another
at
no
cost
and
have
been
working
great
love
these
like
that
there
are
no
cords
or
wires
to
get
tangled
in
my
hair/clothes
or
accidentally
pulled
out
the
sound
is
amazing
and
they
fit
comfortably
in
my
ears
was
able
to
use
them
to
talk
on
the
phone
as
well
and
you
can
even
leave
one
out
if
you
would
like
the
packaging
is
great
and
it
comes
with
carrying
case
and
additional
supplies
overall
love
these
wouldn't
recommend
zero
base
sounds
like
listening
to
headphones
from
the
dollar
tree
these
are
really
great
earbuds
fit
good,
great
sound,
very
easy
to
pair
to
your
phone
they
would
have
been
great
if
could
have
got
base
out
of
them
that
was
the
only
thing
lacking
the
fit
and
sound
was
great
but
no
base
usually
use
wired
earbuds
that
had
great
bass
sounds
for
the
$0
spent
this
product
would
not
pair
with
my
pc
which
has
bluetooth
adaptor
plugged
in
worked
good
with
my
phone
thoughthe
instructions
that
were
part
of
the
package
were
very
vague
on
what
to
do
if
they
did
not
automatically
pair
the
website
wasn't
any
better
this
item
will
be
returned
these
wireless
earbuds
are
great
for
traveling
the
case
is
also
charging
doc
it
has
long
life
and
is
very
handing
when
traveling
the
ear
buds
have
good
sound
quality
and
cancel
out
most
of
background
noise
overall
good
product
these
are
great
the
instructions
on
how
to
properly
turn
on
&
link
to
my
iphone
were
very
easy
to
understandthey
come
in
this
charging
case
which
is
super
nicei
got
them
super
quick
and
first
thing
this
morning
and
have
been
using
them
while
at
workdefinitely
super
please
with
these
they
fit
comfortably
in
my
ear
without
them
falling
out
like
my
corded
headphonesi
super
exited
to
use
these
going
forward
the
sound
is
good,
but
little
on
the
tinny
side
mainly
because
of
the
total
lack
of
bass
wished
i'd
done
little
more
research
read
the
great
review's
and
to
the
bad
review's
with
grain
of
salti
want
to
go
deaf
if
turn
them
all
the
way
up
but
this
is
not
the
casethey
are
ok
so
far
but
will
up
grade
from
these
definitely
for
sure
worked
great
for
months
way
better
than
wired
headphones
traveled
out
of
country
with
them
used
almost
every
day
felt
like
the
battery
lasted
forever
unfortunately
the
right
earbud
will
no
longer
sinc
up
left
ear
bud
works
fine
still
wow
love
them
so
far
sound
quality
is
awesome
the
battery
life
amazing
and
the
case
even
charges
my
phone
also
appreciate
the
xtra
rubber
pieces
and
carrying
bag
earbuds
were
fantastic
for
the
first
few
months,
but
now
the
right
one
on
both
sets
is
unusable
one
set,
the
right
constantly
pairs
and
unpairs
every
few
seconds,
and
the
other
set
pairs
fine
but
the
right
bud
has
no
volume
0/0/0
purchased
these
back
in
dec
and
the
battery
life
now
only
lasts
~0
min
at
time
it
does
charge
back
up
fast,
but
if
cant
get
through
workout
without
the
headphones
dying
what
is
the
point
sound
quality/noisecancelling
is
good
but
the
touchsensitive
functionality
of
the
buds
also
doesn't
work
properly
and
has
gotten
worse
over
time
as
well
only
buy
these
if
you
want
something
that
is
going
to
break
over
few
months'
time
i'm
looking
elsewhere
for
my
next
purchase
the
touch
sensor
stopped
working
in
the
right
bud
but
that
was
after
about
months
and
the
sound
is
great
was
also
very
waterproof
have
to
be
quiet
in
the
morning,
but
like
listening
to
music
in
the
shower,
so
they
were
very
useful
sad
that
lost
the
charging
case
it
was
quite
exciting
to
find
out
how
great
this
headset
was
immediately
out
of
box
pairing
was
instantaneous,
but
more
importantly
it
does
without
any
latency
or
having
to
mess
around
to
make
it
work
when
first
receive
this
product
it
work
let
but
month
later
it
stop
working
the
volume
on
the
ear
buds
faded
out
the
person
on
the
other
can't
hear
you
at
all
the
right
ear
buds
total
dead
and
it
went
hold
charge
anymore
they're
very
comfortable
the
sound
quality
is
phenomenal
didn't
feel
like
they
were
going
to
fall
out
at
all
either
had
for
over
year
after
months
of
great
sound
one
side
quit
working
my
husband
loves
these
they
were
gift
and
the
only
downside
is
the
battery
doesn't
last
to
long
when
listening
to
music
am
really
impressed
with
these
ear
buds
the
sound
quality
is
great,
they
are
more
comfortable
than
expected
and
the
battery
life
is
awesome
wear
them
one
at
time
throughout
my
work
day,
rotating
occasionally
and
the
charger
box
lasts
all
week
used
for
several
days,
the
effect
is
good,
the
sound
quality
is
good,
the
battery
is
durable,
fast
charging,
the
key
is
that
it
can
also
be
used
as
charging
treasure,
easy
to
carry,
very
satisfied
the
ear
pod
did
not
link
up
with
devices
bought
it
for
would
not
link
up
with
the
tv
or
my
ipad
really
like
this
wirelessearphones
they
are
just
the
right
size
for
easy
handling,
and
tucking
in
pocket
they
work
well
with
all
of
my
devices
bought
these
thinking
all
the
reviews
were
fake,
but
that
could
just
return
them
if
they
didn't
perform
that
was
few
months
ago
don't
regret
the
purchaseof
note:
the
little
wax
paper
between
the
plastic
ear
cushion
and
the
speaker
is
flimsy,
and
there
don't
appear
to
be
replacements
in
the
kit
uhdon't
lose
that
wax
paper
would
actually
say
the
sound
quality
is
better
than
air
pods
the
major
issue
is
the
bluetooth
pairing
failures
the
head
phones
constantly
cut
out,
drop
the
pairing,
only
have
one
side
work,
or
won
pair
without
constantly
turning
on
and
off
bluetooth
if
you
are
looking
for
cheaper
alternative
to
airpods
and
can
work
through
tech
failures
these
work
if
not
don
buy
they
aren't
great
for
phone
calls
which
i'm
disappointed
inthey
fit
great
and
actually
stay
in
great
sound
quality
you
can
listen
with
just
ear
bud
but
it's
not
as
good
as
if
it
were
with
both
but
still
decent
love
that
they
pair
and
turn
on
when
take
then
out
of
the
box
battery
life
seems
good
overall
i'm
impressed
and
quite
happy
bought
few
pairs
of
them
from
different
manufacturesthese
are
by
far
the
worst
and
not
the
cheapest
dont
do
it
i've
been
using
these
for
days
now
and
no
matter
what
do
it
won't
work
correctly
it
will
connect
but
then
make
weird
noises,
disconnect,
then
connect
multiple
timesand
during
all
of
this
cannot
hear
the
caller
but
instead
we
both
hear
what
the
device
is
doing
great
product
for
the
gym
use
it
for
treadmill
and
hope
rump
comes
with
different
size
buds
to
fit
all
ears
these
were
really
great
at
first,
but
after
using
for
month
one
ear
piece
quit
working
also
when
speaking
on
the
phone
while
using
these
no
body
could
understand
what
was
saying
batteries
also
only
lasted
hours
definitely
bummed
about
this
purchase
extremely
disappointed
in
these
headphones
the
sound
was
good
and
they
were
comfortable
however
had
them
for
less
than
months
and
suddenly
they
don
charge
in
the
charging
station
don
buy
these
they
are
waste
of
money
do
yourself
favor
and
go
with
apple
or
beats
or
samsung
cause
these
cheap
knock
offs
are
far
off
from
good
quality
buds
unpair
for
no
reason
if
your
away
from
the
case
your
screwed
bud's
have
fit
if
you
try
to
use
both
immediately
from
the
case
pairing
fails
0%
of
the
time
with
any
device
my
other
set
of
buds
work
finevery
frustrating
this
product
is
horrible
called
in
twice
to
try
and
get
tech
support
and
still
not
working
correctly
you
can
reset
and
it
will
connect
for
maybe
minutes
max
and
then
disconnects
the
right
one
we
could
never
get
it
to
work
and
even
when
support
helped
to
get
connected
only
lasted
for
few
minutes
the
first
few
weeks
the
left
one
would
work
correctly
and
my
husband
likes
the
size
so
kept
trying
to
make
work
but
give
up
when
take
out
the
earpiece
to
listen
to
something
on
my
phone,
it'll
connect,
but
won't
act
like
it
so
need
to
put
it
back
in
it's
case
to
turn
it
off,
then
repeat
the
process
until
it
connects
properly
other
than
that,
everything
is
great
about
this
product
got
this
wireless
headphones
bluetooth
headset
for
my
wife
she
loved
this
headset
lot
best
qualitysound
quality
is
surprisingly
best
for
this
price
and
pairing
was
simple,
great
battery
life
battery
lasts
0+
hours
she
use
most
at
in
work
and
very
very
useful
suggest
worth
to
buy
bought
these
earbuds
because
needed
something
hands
free
and
something
can
listen
to
while
am
riding
my
bike
these
are
the
best
thing
have
ever
purchased
the
sound
quality
is
exceptional
and
don't
have
any
background
noisethe
best
thing
is
that
they
stay
in
my
ears
no
matter
the
terrain
am
traveling
onlove
these
bought
these
about
weeks
ago
for
starters
the
volume
wasn't
that
great
but
it
was
something
could
live
with
after
the
first
week
the
right
ear
but
put
out
little
to
no
audio
week
after
the
left
earbud
is
doing
the
same
thing
have
emailed
the
company
to
see
if
they
will
make
it
right
but
as
of
now
i'd
pay
the
$
extra
and
get
good
quality
set
two
months
after
owning
the
product
and
using
the
on
product
keys
sparingly
the
volume
up
key
stopped
working
so
headphones
got
stuck
on
low
volume
as
everytime
you
put
them
in
your
ear
the
volume
down
button
was
selected
was
attracted
to
the
cheap
pricing
so
gave
it
shot
sound
quality
is
great
but
unfortunately
didn
last
longer
than
months
one
side
no
longer
worked
and
the
other
side
eventually
gave
out
couple
weeks
after
guess
this
time
ll
have
to
purchase
more
expensive
pair
of
earpods
so
at
least
they
ll
last
longer
so
happy
with
my
new
wireless
earbuds
they're
very
comfortable
the
battery
stays
charged
for
quite
awhile
worked
well
to
watch
movies
on
my
ipad
and
make
phone
calls
with
my
google
pixel
phone
super
easy
to
connect
via
bluetooth
on
both
devices
use
these
mainly
for
working
out
the
sound
quality
is
great
and
the
product
design
looks
very
nice
in
your
ear
they
never
fall
out
of
my
ears
while
working
out
and
the
battery
life
has
been
fine
so
far
with
the
charging
case,
never
even
worry
about
battery
life
and
it
gives
me
good
place
to
store
them
definitely
the
best
bang
for
your
buck
wireless
headphones
on
amazon
love
these
earbuds
the
sound
quality
is
great
and
love
the
fact
that
the
charging
case
is
also
powerbank
can
listen
to
my
music
and
use
the
case
to
charge
my
phone
at
the
same
time
not
the
greatest
at
noise
cancellation,
but
would
definitely
buy
again
buyer
beware
sound
was
good
while
they
worked
using
them
times
week
in
the
gym
but
one
of
the
buds
went
bad
and
the
volume
decreased
to
less
than
half
of
what
it
was
in
the
beginning
tried
everything
from
reset
and
increasing
and
decreasing
volume
but
to
no
avail
had
to
return
and
now
trying
different
manufacturer
have
had
these
for
about
week
and
they
have
been
terrible
after
working
out
for
about
minutes
the
battery
was
low
thought
this
was
my
fault
so
made
sure
to
charge
them
fully
same
thing
the
next
day
after
about
my
fifth
time
wearing
these
headphones
the
right
ear
piece
lost
considerable
about
of
sound
and
again
the
battery
issue
was
still
there
furthermore,
the
sound
quality
lacks
any
bass
and
is
very
flat
am
going
to
look
for
new
pair
of
affordable
earbuds
asap
these
are
so
great
i've
never
used
ear
buds
before
because
they
are
usually
uncomfortable
these
didn't
hurt
at
all
sounds
great
as
well
this
is
my
first
time
writing
review
was
shocked
by
how
amazing
this
product
is
love
how
it
looks
and
how
the
sound
qualities
that
has
caused
in
my
ear
it
like
we
have
party
time
love
how
fast
it
came
it
was
two
days
early
and
the
material
quality
was
amazing
sure
ll
buy
more
for
my
family
members
highly
recommended
battery
life
for
the
headphones
and
the
case
are
amazing
headphones
fit
very
comfortable
in
your
ear
slept
with
them
on
and
they
never
fell
out
my
ear
the
sound
quality
is
amazing
watched
many
videos
and
scroll
through
all
my
social
media
accounts
and
have
zero
complaints
about
the
sound
they
are
also
great
for
gym
use
and
exercise,
they
stayed
inside
my
ears
the
whole
workout
noise
cancellation
is
good
couldn't
hear
extra
gym
noises
when
my
music
was
playing
it
just
normal
nothing
special,
but
the
touch
button
is
so
sensitive
it
little
hard
to
control
at
one
time
so
give
stars
the
price
is
good
compare
to
bose,
beats
or
sony
love
these
they
stay
in
well
cancel
out
the
outside
world,
they
really
are
waterproof
already
accidentally
left
them
in
the
rain
and
they
still
sound
amazing
and
work
great
love
that
can
charge
my
phone
with
the
case
when
forget
my
charger
great
noise
cancelling
and
music
quality
the
phone
function
is
terriblecould
be
just
this
pair
but
never
answer
calls
anymore
through
the
headphones
it
is
very
inconvenient
battery
life
is
average
however
the
feed
does
break
occasionally
and
the
proximity
range
does
decrease
from
the
phone
if
its
not
at
0%
charged
level
my
morning
jogs
just
got
better
the
sound
is
excellent
in
this
very
easy
to
pair
to
my
phone
have
no
complaints
about
this
so
far
very
good
sound
quality
linked
quickly
to
my
phone
bought
it
for
while
work
but
dies
very
quickly
otherwise
good
product
love
these
wireless
earbuds
no
more
wires
hanging
around
my
neck
great
sound
very
discreet
no
one
can
tell
you
are
wearing
them
unless
they
look
real
close
great
value
for
the
price
product
was
good
as
so
many
good
review
on
amazon
but
may
be
got
defective
piece
my
right
ear
bud
was
not
working
properly
and
it
doesnt
cancel
any
noise
when
am
talking
with
someone
inside
the
car
its
good
as
soon
get
out
have
to
cut
the
phone
because
too
much
noise
it
produce
nice
earphones
they
seem
durable
and
work
well
with
my
devices
that
have
tried
them
with
still
on
my
first
charge
phones
calls
are
successful
only
had
one
complaint
of
not
being
able
to
hear
me
but
reset
them
and
they
have
worked
fine
since
really
liked
these
headphones
they
connect
automatically
when
put
them
on
also
they
stayed
in
my
ears
when
was
working
out
or
walking
the
battery
life
is
really
good,
as
i've
only
needed
to
charge
these
times
in
the
months
that
i've
owned
them
also,
when
had
an
issue
pairing,
pasonomi
helped
me
out
through
their
facebook
page
the
noice
cancellation
is
soso
because
this
isn't
an
overear
headphones,
but
other
than
that
really
like
it
would
definitely
recommend
garbage
bought
this
in
august
0,
here
we
are
december
and
it
suddenly
stop
working
battery
life
is
trash
don't
waste
your
time
or
money
only
if
you
looking
for
something
cheap
that
won't
last
long
trash
these
are
amazing
the
charging
base
is
such
plus
so
far
they
disconnect
while
am
walking
and
listening
to
music
they
reconnect
quickly
but
it
is
unpleasant
phone
calls
dont
work
unless
yell
the
other
person
cant
hear
me0
months
into
owning
them,
the
left
one
has
stopped

completely

great
pair
of
wireless
earbuds
wanted
pair
to
run
with
that
stayed
in
my
ears
and
these
did
it
sound
is
good
and
ease
of
use
is
great
best
selling
point
is
comfort
fit
is
great
sound
is
clear
bass
would
be
more
present
with
foam
ear
tips
touch
control
sensitive
single
pairing
available
bought
these
earbuds
for
my
husband's
birthday
and
they
are
pretty
awesome
for
the
first
couple
of
weeks
after
the
second
charge
on
the
dock,
it
won't
charge
the
earbuds
anymore
my
husband
was
so
excited
when
we
first
got
them
but
he's
so
disappointed
now
guess
you
get
what
you
pay
for
who
needs
to
spend
hundreds
for
the
apple
stuff
when
you
can
get
affordable
substitutes
the
sound
is
great
and
they
comfortable
also,
the
battery
life
is
surprisingly
good
broken
within
days
sound
cut
out
of
side
volume
so
low
cant
hear
anything
connects
and
disconnects
randomly
continues
to
play
after
you
take
them
out
of
ears
barely
responds
to
touch
would
expect
these
to
last
longer
than
year
and
half
now
only
one
works
ve
taken
very
good
care
of
them
and
they
mostly
just
sat
on
my
desk
good
snug
fit
to
ensure
earphones
stay
in
place
effective
noise
cancellation
and
excellent
sound
quality
earphones
are
easy
to
pair
to
phone
and
to
charge
very
convenient
and
useful
am
very
happy
with
this
purchase
like
that
the
volume
control
is
on
my
cellphone
because
past
earbuds
with
onboard
volume
control
would
fall
out
when
tried
to
adjust
the
volume
these
are
sturdy,
well
made
earbuds
and
the
charging
case
is
not
only
closed
magnetically,
but
it
see
through
so
you
can
see
the
blue
charge
level
lights
and
the
earbuds
lights
through
the
lid
dont
buy
these
earbuds
they
are
cheap
chinese
earbuds
that
should
sell
for
no
more
than
$0
they
are
extremely
annoying
aswell
the
only
way
and
the
advertised
way
to
turn
them
on/off
is
to
turn
bluetooth
on/off
your
phone
this
means
if
you
keep
bluetooth
on
for
your
smart
watch
or
car,
the
earbuds
will
automatically
turn
on
and
link
to
your
phone
the
range
is
great,
they
still
connect
even
if
store
them
across
the
house
these
fit
very
and
are
extremely
easy
to
set
up
am
not
an
overly
tech
savvy
and
the
set
and
controls
were
easy
for
me
they
do
not
block
sound
0%
but
you
have
to
take
them
out
to
hear
somebody
talking
next
to
you
even
when
there
is
no
sound
being
generated
these
come
in
at
good
price
point
and
the
portable
charging
station
is
great
bonus
just
received
these
and
i'm
shocked
at
how
good
they
sound
normally
earbuds
have
no
bass
and
end
up
returning
many
pair
these
have
bass
and
stay
in
place
i'm
happy
customer
love
these
sound
great
just
what
was
looking
for
the
feel
of
the
ear
peices
are
great
and
the
case
is
cool
how
it
can
charge
other
devices
with
the
build
in
usb
connection,
but
the
quality
of
sound
just
isn't
therethe
left
ear
peices
for
some
reason
has
very
little
base
compared
to
the
right
which
sounds
great
tried
unsyncing
them
from
my
phone
and
syncing
again
but
still
no
base
from
the
left
tried
connecting
them
to
my
computer
but
same
issue
there,
very
little
base
from
left
compared
to
right
first
of
all,
am
very
satisfied
amazon
customer,
but
can't
recommend
these
headphones
they
worked
for
months
and
started
deteriorating
ever
since
they
don't
pair
well
and
sometimes
just
won't
turn
on
there
are
other
better
options
occasionally
the
unit
seems
to
lock
up
and
be
unuseable
these
are
great
for
working
out
they
stay
put
and
there
is
no
cord
to
get
in
the
way
the
sound
is
clear
am
happy
with
the
product
especially
for
the
price
the
only
issue
is
the
user
not
the
product
with
the
blue
tooth
from
my
car
not
connecting
and
to
the
earbuds
instead
when
i'm
drivung
but
i'll
master
that
eventually
very
happy
so
far

need
use
them
at
work,
and
at
home,
and
at
the
jogging
very
comfortablyi
would
recommend
this
earbuds
to
anyone
looking
to
cut
the
their
cord
charge
hold
for
long
time
put
stars
the
battery
life
is
really
impressive,
took
weeks
to
drain
the
first
charge
use
one
throughout
the
day
and
two
when
working
out
the
only
issue
ve
had
is
that
the
right
channel
will
cut
out/lose
signal
occasionally
when
using
both
buds
they
re
discreet
and
both
call
quality
and
sound
quality
are
fantastic
great
deal,
solid
product
bought
these
for
just
everyday
use
and
they
work
great
no
issues
what
so
ever
the
battery
life
is
great,
sound
is
great,
the
distance
my
phone
can
be
from
the
earphones
and
still
play
music
is
amazing
id
say
this
is
great
product
enjoyed
this
product
despite
hour
battery
life
they're
comfortable
and
the
sound
quality
is
decent
however
after
few
months,
the
audio
of
the
right
earbud
has
become
about
0%
quieter
than
the
left
earbud
the
imbalance
in
volume
of
the
earbuds
makes
it
difficult
to
enjoy
this
product
these
headphones
worked
well
to
start
but
they
refused
to
stay
connected
to
my
phone
and
each
other
only
one
of
them
would
connect
to
my
phone
and
the
other
one
wouldn't
connect
at
all
so
only
had
one
headphone
for
awhile
looked
up
videos
on
how
to
reconnect
them
but
it
wouldn't
remain
connected
trash
they
keep
disconnecting
from
my
phone
then
she
started
making
loud
continuous
noise
everytime
try
to
push
them
in
my
ear
because
they
slip
constantly,
they
hang
up
after
few
months
of
usage
stop
using
it
right
one
disconnect
often
from
audio
or
have
intermittent
sound
it
disconnected
once
from
the
left
one
and
figure
out
how
to
pair
it
again
base
on
google
page,
but
then
the
volume
is
lower
that
the
left
ear
really
bad
purchase
when
working
out
in
smaller
gym
or
at
home
with
pretty
much
no
one
around,
these
work
great
and
love
them,
but
like
to
run
0k
races
and
it
does
not
like
all
the
other
blue
tooth
connections
around
and
would
never
pair,
was
very
frustrating
also
not
huge
fan
of
the
only
way
to
reset
turn
off
and
on
is
by
putting
them
back
in
the
charging
case
other
than
that
they've
been
fine,
not
the
best
on
battery
life
get
approx
hrs
out
of
one
charge
but
you
get
what
you
pay
for
these
buds
are
an
excellent
value
they
last
couple
hours
or
so,
they
sound
good,
and
fit
well
because
they
come
with
few
different
sizes
of
ear
pieces
added
bonus
you
can
charge
your
phone
off
the
docking
station
for
these
buds
these
were
gift
to
my
husband
for
christmas
when
he
first
got
them
they
were
great
couple
months
later
and
the
sound
seems
to
have
faded
in
way
they
are
not
noise
canceling
at
all,
and
when
he
is
running
on
treadmill
he
says
it
almost
pointless
using
them
because
they
don
turn
up
enough
to
drown
out
the
sound
of
the
treadmill
the
only
thing
he
likes
is
that
they
charge
in
in
the
case
and
they
do
stay
put
when
he
running
this
are
some
of
the
best
wireless
headphones
have
ever
had
there
comfortable
easy
to
work
and
they
have
great
sound
an
noise
cancelation
they
last
good
hours
really
depends
on
what
you
are
doing
they
only
take
minutes
to
charge
which
is
amazing
and
it
comes
with
not
only
just
the
charger
but
it
portable
charger
as
well
it
just
all
together
great
product
they
are
working
fine,
looking
for
cheaper
solution
rather
than
buy
the
iphone
this
are
solution
not
booming,
but
comfortable,
charging
station
holds
charge
for
long
time
these
are
great
for
music,
watching
videos
on
your
phone,
etc
they
aren't
great
for
phone
calls
overall
they
are
fantastic
for
the
gym,
walking,
videos,
etc
have
been
trying
many
different
brands
of
ear
buds
with
little
satisfaction
received
these
and
the
minute
turned
them
on,
was
hooked
love
that
they
are
wireless
and
begin
to
pair
with
my
phone
as
soon
as
take
them
out
of
the
base
also
the
confirmation
that
both
sides
have
been
connected
leaves
out
any
doubt
wore
these
earbuds
for
half
marathon
ran
couple
of
days
ago
and
the
battery
lasted
the
whole
time
they
fit
in
my
ears
well
and
did
not
have
to
adjust
them
and
never
felt
that
they
were
falling
out
the
sound
was
great,
much
better
than
other
wired
headphones
have
would
definitely
recommend
these,
especially
if
you
need
something
to
work
out
in
find
the
sound
quality
great
the
sound
canceling
is
great
had
issues
with
other
earbuds
falling
off
but
this
one
fits
perfectly
not
only
that,
the
battery
seems
to
last
forever
the
power
bank
is
also
very
handy
for
charging
my
phone
when
need
to
great
purchase
all
together
when
first
got
the
headphones
was
little
concerned
because
ve
always
had
issues
with
earbuds
staying
in
my
ears
but
they
actually
fit
perfectly
and
they
re
really
comfortable
love
that
they
re
noice
cancelling,
even
when
my
volumes
low
can
only
hear
what
going
on
in
my
ears
they
are
great
and
definitely
will
be
recommending
these
earbuds
to
all
of
my
friends
great
product
for
great
price
i've
listened
for
up
to
hours
straight
without
the
battery
going
out
charging
is
super
fast
and
constant
as
long
as
ear
buds
are
in
their
case
sounds
great
and
noise
cancellation
works
almost
too
well
don't
expect
to
hear
much
outside
noise
while
wearing
these
they
are
easy
to
use
and
the
battery
like
is
good
so
awful
just
atrocious
earbuds
bad
sound
quality,
don't
block
any
noise,
battery
lasts
only
hours,
constantly
disconnecting
from
eachother
&
your
device
extremely
bad
quality
of
materials
too,
the
mesh
on
the
earhole
is
joke
in
the
hopes
that
you
don't
notice
you
just
paid
for
hollow
plastic
very
good
sound
quality
but
the
battery
only
last
hours
maximum
the
battery
life
so
far
has
been
great
the
touch
controls
are
responsive
and
working
well
the
pouch
that
is
included
is
also
very
nice
as
well
as
protective
the
earbuds
connect
seamlessly
after
taking
them
out
of
the
case
the
case
that
doubles
as
portable
charger
has
also
come
in
handy
multiple
times
overall,
great
buy
great
sound
quality
this
is
my
first
experience
with
wireless
ear
buds
and
they
are
two
thumbs
up
traveling
tomorrow
for
work
and
definitely
will
be
using
them
on
the
plane
did
not
use
these
to
work
out
they
are
pretty
comfy
and
lightweight
nice
product
for
the
price
point
just
got
these
buds
today,
and
was
just
playing
some
jams
while
decided
which
size
earpiece
to
use
and
realized
my
girlfriend
had
been
trying
to
talk
to
me
for
the
past
minutes
and
was
now
glaring
at
me
didn't
even
notice
her
talking
these
earbuds
have
amazing
sound
quality,
comfort,
and
noise
cancellation
for
the
price
of
them
ve
had
these
for
months
and
am
very
happy
they
sync
up
fast
and
have
had
no
issues
with
them
like
the
product,
the
quality
is
more
than
good
the
sound
is
great,
also
the
bass
it
chargers
super
quick
and
it
is
easy
to
connect
to
your
phones
bluetooth
the
only
downside
is
that
sometimes
they
slip
out
of
the
ear,
or
they
feel
like
"oily",
even
though
your
ears
are
clean
hahaha
other
than
that,
would
but
it
again
received
these
wireless
earphones
,
and
very
satisfied
with
them
it
was
very
easy
to
get
them
setup
and
will
be
automatically
connected
or
disconnected
when
wear
them
or
put
them
back
to
the
charging
case
used
them
to
listen
music
when
doing
exercise
in
gym
and
to
make
phone
calls
all
hands
free
these
earbuds
are
easy
to
set
up,
if
you
having
trouble
connecting
there
is
even
facebook
video
with
directionsif
you
like
to
listen
to
music
in
bed
these
are
great
because
they
do
not
hurt
your
ears
if
you
lay
down
with
themthese
also
have
good
range,
was
able
to
have
phone
conversation
while
being
in
one
room
and
my
phone
in
another
can
say
how
much
love
these
earbuds
anymore
than
am
comfortable
and
easy
to
pair
great
sound
and
don
fall
out
of
your
ear
when
you
run
love
love
love
had
these
for
months
love
them
my
husband
works
from
home
and
uses
them
for
his
meetings
was
impressed,
easy
hook
up,
easy
charge
and
amazing
quality
felt
like
was
wearing
$0
headphones
honestly
would
highly
recommend
for
people
who
like
to
go
hands
free
and
don
want
to
go
broke
paying
for
it
am
planning
on
purchasing
more
for
the
family
my
favorite
feature
is
the
charging
case/storage
which
is
also
power
bank
sound
quality
is
pretty
good
not
great,
phone
calls
on
my
end
are
crisp
and
clear
and
on
the
other
end
i've
been
told
it's
not
great
but
they
can
hear
me
well
enough
that
i've
never
had
to
repeat
myself
don't
make
phone
calls
often
so
this
isn't
that
important
to
me
all
in
all
highly
recommend
these
earbuds
love
the
compact
design
of
the
charging
case
ti
was
previously
using
collar
headset
that
rubbed
against
my
neck
and
was
irritating,
so
these
were
really
nice
alternative
love
listening
to
the
music
while
going
about
my
everyday
life,
and
just
can't
believe
the
sound
quality
that
comes
from
these
earbuds
have
had
other
wireless
earbuds
that
didn't
even
come
close
to
the
sound
quality
that
these
have
or
the
range
these
ear
buds
have
enough
range
on
them
that
don't
have
to
be
tied
down
to
my
device
this
is
an
excellent
product
and
would
certain
recommend
them
to
friends
or
family
love
these
usually
use
them
at
work
&
only
use
one
have
had
for
month
&
only
charged
the
case
once
easy
to
sink
&
use
was
looking
for
wireless,
without
breaking
the
bank
these
were
everything
was
looking
for
and
more
decent
enough
sound,
nothing
mindblowing,
but
the
convenience
of
being
wireless,
and
charging
case
that
also
charges
your
phone
more
than
made
up
for
it
so
far
this
has
been
the
best
purchase
earphone
wise
it
super
lightweight,
last
about
hours
and
love
the
charger
as
battery
bank
for
my
earphones
and
my
phone
so
far
no
complaint
about
it
also
fakespot
rated
this
as
meaning
rating
means
it
legit
this
wireless
headphone
has
not
delayed
and
didn
interrupt
signal
when
was
in
mall
or
any
supermarket,
it
still
work
good
the
quality
and
material
makes
me
satisfied
with
this
price
size
and
comfort
of
these
earbuds
are
fabulous
charging
case
is
very
convenient
and
pairing
device
was
quick
&
fairly
simple
disappointed
that
they
cannot
be
used
aboard
aircraft
look
forward
to
using
them
at
the
gym
sounds
great
batteries
last
hours
of
music
case
keeps
them
charged
when
not
in
use
if
could
do
for
battery
life
would
do
stars
i've
used
it
times
and
fully
charge
it
within
week
battery
pack
is
dead
wish
used
it
more
when
bought
it
would
of
sent
this
trash
back
these
headphones
are
awesome
have
used
several
different
brands
and
they
usually
fall
out
of
my
ears
but
these
ones
stay
in
when
run
and
everythingwhen
use
them
to
talk
on
everyone
says
they
can
hear
me
clearly
and
the
recharge
feature
with
the
box
amazing
these
are
great,
if
my
left
earbud
didn't
have
weird
crackle
to
it
and
things
sounded
off
have
to
adjust
the
earbud
to
certain
spot
for
it
to
sound
good,
for
the
most
part
they
generally
do
work
but
in
short
time
one
starts
to
function
at
much
higher
volume
than
the
other
it
very
annoying
and
if
you
turn
up
the
volume
it
only
raises
on
the
side
that
already
louder
it
is
really
annoying
because
tried
to
get
in
contact
with
the
manufacturer
and
they
never
got
back
to
me
was
bit
skeptical
at
first
when
bought
it
but
all
my
doubts
vanished
when
tried
them
on
the
sound
is
amazing
and
it
fit
my
ear
perfectly
and
comfortably
and
the
best
part
is
that
they
didn't
fall
off
during
my
workout
would
definitely
recommend
these
to
anyone
who
wants
highquality
wireless
bluetooth
earbuds
0%
worth
the
price
i've
been
using
it
for
over
week
now,
and
love
it
the
earbuds
are
completely
fit
to
my
ears
it's
comfortable
for
working
out
and
using
at
work
not
bad
set
of
earbuds,
good
price
and
good
sound
use
these
when
go
to
vegas
and
walk
the
strip
and
had
no
issues
they
work
pretty
well,
the
connection
is
strong
even
when
in
another
room,
but
linking
the
bluetooth
is
paini
have
to
relink
it
every
time
take
out
an
earbud
and
one
earbud
has
totally
stopped
charging
now
cannot
even
use
it
revised
review
after
few
months
the
right
one
doesn't
work
at
all
just
get
sound
from
one
i've
looked
through
google
and
it's
common
problem
don't
get
thesefind
different
ones
personally
would
like
bit
more
bass
otherwise
great
product
have
acre
farm
wear
these
while
mowing
and
listening
to
podcasts
it
makes
the
time
go
by
fast
they
are
the
easiest
things
to
pair
ve
ever
owned
take
them
out
of
the
case
and
they
re
telling
me
they
re
paired
already
have
used
these
headphone
for
about
weeks
and
really
enjoy
them
during
my
exercise
routine
at
first
was
concerned
about
the
sound
quality,
but
tried
several
different
sizes
of
the
little
earpiece
covers
until
found
the
one
that
fit
my
ears
the
best
now,
the
sound
quality
is
really
good
the
battery
lasts
for
hours,
and
the
recharging
station
has
good
design
for
the
price
paid,
these
headphone
would
say
are
very
good
value
these
bluetooth
ear
buds
perform
better
than
any
boxed
with
your
new
phone
and
definitely
on
par
with
wired
senheisser
will
update
this
as
continue
to
use
them
but
mainly
got
these
for
noise
cancelling
abilities
and
they
work
really
well
can
barely
hear
myself
walk
when
have
them
in
have
used
them
for
hours
without
battery
recharge
as
well
not
good
purchase
we
are
on
our
second
pair
and
the
headphones
stop
syncing
together
so,
you
will
have
on
connected
and
the
other
one
isn't
super
annoying
sending
back
again
really
loved
these
earbuds
and
used
the
left
one
often
but
because
they're
not
secured
in
the
ear
in
any
way
it
came
loose
when
needed
to
bend
over
it
finally
got
lost,
and
because
only
the
left
bud
can
pair
to
device
now
have
one
useless
earbud
and
phone
batterycan't
recommend
first
time
getting
wireless
headphones
and
very
disappointed
they
wont
hold
charge
for
very
long
and
the
sound
gets
broken
if
im
too
far
away
from
phone
more
then
steps
away
bought
them
cuz
thought
it
had
honest
reviews
but
dont
feel
like
they
were
true
tried
to
only
use
side
but
it
would
not
connect
or
it
would
just
shut
off
wish
didn't
wait
so
long
to
use
them
so
could
return
them
but
im
learning
the
hard
way
bought
these
as
gift
for
christmas,
but
they
stopped
working
by
early
march
unfortunately,
enough
has
passed
that
no
longer
able
to
return
them,
so
very
disappointed
that
they
didn
last
longer
then
0/0
months
these
are
great
earbuds
for
music,
however,
when
on
phone
call
not
so
much
can
barely
hear
the
person
on
the
other
line
and
they
cant
hear
me
either
i've
checked
my
settings
and
everything
and
raised
the
volume
all
the
way
up
and
still
can't
get
the
thing
to
work
properly
for
phone
calls
had
these
for
one
day
and
like
them
but
they
keep
shorting
out
and
skips
when
song
is
playing
very
dissapointed
for
$0
feel
completely
ripped
off
great
price,
great
sound
have
bought
three
pairs
of
these
for
the
kids
these
work
as
described
and
very
well
it
does
last
hours,
but
it
comes
with
charge
bank
that
charges
pretty
quickly
so
you
will
get
good
amount
of
time
out
before
the
whole
bank
needs
recharge
sync
easily
both
singles
and
dual
doesn't
sit
in
the
ear
that
steady
though
if
your
in
workout
may
fall
out
really
good
pair
of
earbuds
fits
great
on
my
ears
with
the
standard
sizes
of
the
buds
great
bass,
noise
cancelation
and
really
good
battery
life
overall
the
battery
life
and
sound
quality
are
excellent
they
are
not
very
effective
when
trying
to
talk
on
the
phone
the
ear
buds
are
better
suited
for
listening
only
it
is
also
sometimes
difficult
to
switch
between
devices
overall
am
very
pleased
with
my
purchase
and
would
recommend
them
just
bought
this
earbuds
like
weeks
ago
this
one
is
the
best
bluetooth
earbuds
in
all
my
collection
the
sound
is
good
and
also
the
noise
resistance
with
this
price
you
can't
hear
the
noise
around
if
you
put
both
earbuds
in
after
bought
it,
recommend
it
to
my
friends
and
bought
of
it
for
them
they
also
give
me
good
feedback
nice
one
they
were
purchased
for
my
husband
couple
of
months
ago
he
used
them
for
his
daily
walks/runs
with
our
son
and
dog
last
week
he
lost
the
charger
box
for
them
customer
service
has
been
extremely
helpful
and
replacement
charger
box
is
being
sent
out
to
us
would
definitely
recommend
them
to
anyone
looking
for
wireless
headphones
the
only
down
side
is
they
are
bit
big
for
my
small
ears
so
think
they
would
be
uncomfortable
after
long
wear
originally
purchased
enacfire,
but
they
were
so
bulky
and
have
tiny
ears
didnt
like
the
way
they
felt
or
looked
on
me
so
decided
to
try
these
and
they
are
so
much
more
form
fitting,
plus
the
adjustable
sizes
that
come
with
it
if
you
are
looking
for
less
expensive,
quality
pair
of
wireless
earbuds,
this
may
be
the
perfect
ones
for
you
great
earphones,
the
only
thing
is
the
charge
doesn
last
as
long
as
like
and
if
you
only
want
to
use
one
earphone
you
can
leave
the
left
earphone
charging
because
it
won
connect
to
bluetooth
these
ear
buds
are
amazing
used
them
in
the
pool
and
outside
when
do
yard
work
the
range
is
great,
the
quality
is
excellent
best
$0
i've
spent
really
wanted
to
like
these
based
on
reading
the
other
reviews
for
two
weeks
they
were
good
but
,during
week
three,
the
sound
decreased
significantly
in
the
right
ear
now
it
super
loud
in
the
left
ear
bud
and
barely
audible
in
the
right
it
shame
because
for
two
weeks
they
were
clutch
one
of
earbuds
already
not
working
connection
is
extremely
spotty
goes
in
and
out
lot
i've
owned
lot
of
wireless
headsets
and
this
pair
has
the
worst
connectivity
of
them
all
give
these
the
battery
life
is
surprisingly
good,
easy
to
charge,
easy
to
setup
and
just
great
all
around
the
only
issue
had
was
the
stock
ear
bud
pieces
didn't
fit
the
best
had
to
buy
my
own
at
gas
station
to
get
better
fit,
but
maybe
just
have
freak
ear
canal
or
something
highly
recommended
update:
had
given
0/0
stars
and
liked
the
product
for
the
month
or
so
they
stayed
in
one
piece
and
working
they
stared
messing
up
about
days
in
and
got
help
from
the
company
they
said
they
send
replacement
for
the
right
bud
and
never
did
and
now
the
left
bud
is
messed
up
as
well
avoid
this
mainly
due
to
lack
of
support
and
customer
service
bought
mine
in
oct
don
use
them
very
much
but
now
one
indicates
that
it
is
defective
and
doesn
work
besides
that,
the
left
one
won
stay
in
my
ear
no
matter
which
size
cup
use
ve
ordered
ones
with
ear
clips
awesome
battery
time
for
amazing
play
time
excellent
received
these
as
gift
and
am
extremely
happy
with
them
they
paired
immediately
with
my
cell
phone
the
quality
is
as
good
as
need
very
happy
english
in
instructions
should
be
proofed,
gives
impression
of
cheap
am
so
disappointed
to
be
writing
bad
review
about
this
product
bought
them
for
my
husband
back
in
sept
for
working
out
and
they
stopped
working
two
days
ago
due
to
sweat
damage
one
of
the
main
reasons
went
with
these
headphones
is
because
they
are
advertised
as
being
waterproof
this
is
false
advertisement
if
you
ask
me
in
every
other
aspect
these
headphones
have
performed
as
advertised
and
it
is
huge
shame
that
they
could
not
hold
up
to
little
sweat
very
easy
to
set
up,
like
that
when
you
take
earbuds
off
charging
base
they
automatically
connect
and
they
stay
in
your
ears
like
to
run
and
they
do
not
fall
out
even
when
am
running
in
the
rain
sound
is
great
and
very
comfortable
wearing
many
things
wrong0
can
use
just
one
ear
at
time0
battery
life
is
terrible0
one
evidently
goes
bad
love
everything
about
these
headphones
they
re
small,
convenient,
cancell
out
all
the
noise
at
the
gym,
have
great
bass
and
quality
love
being
able
to
tap
on
the
sides
for
certain
commands,
don
have
to
pick
my
phone
up
they
are
convenient
and
efficient
makes
for
great
gift
wanted
to
give
these
higher
rating
because
do
like
them
but
so
bummed
after
only
year
the
left
bud
stopped
working
only
used
these
for
working
out
and
not
everyday
life
so
not
like
was
over
using
them
what
so
ever
bummed
should
have
gone
with
the
airpods
from
the
beginning
these
wireless
earbuds
are
very
comfortable
to
wear
the
case
is
perfect
to
charge
the
earbuds
and
the
fact
that
it
can
help
charge
my
phone
as
well
is
amazing
the
earbuds
last
long
time
which
is
perfect
for
long
trips
they
are
easy
to
connect
to
the
bluetooth
and
sound
quality
is
great
definitely
recommend
these
earbuds
would
buy
again
love
these
ears
buds
they
fit
comfortably
in
my
ear
and
stayed
in
great
when
wore
them
to
workout
the
sound
is
clear
and
crisp
they
also
were
great
at
keeping
out
outside
noises
looking
forward
to
using
them
for
more
workout
sessions
so
far
was
the
best
every
had,
working
time
week
at
gym
aways
looking
for
easy
carry
and
great
level
of
sound
headphone,
it
the
perfect
fro
the
gym
and
running
using
love
it
definitely
recommended
to
every
one
these
earbuds
are
really
awesome
the
sound
quality
and
battery
life
is
great
too
bought
it
for
myself
and
am
really
glad
to
make
that
decision
liked
how
quickly
the
product
arrived
and
the
overall
design
was
great
they
stayed
in
my
ears
and
the
charging
case
was
nice
feature
however,
they
have
an
effective
range
of
about
feet
things
were
generally
okay
if
put
them
in
my
jacket
pocket,
but
the
connection
got
very
spotty
if
put
them
in
my
pants
pocket
also,
there
is
not
way
to
turn
them
off
unless
you
have
the
case
on
you,
which
found
annoying
great
product
love
iti
had
earphones
that
slide
off
my
head
when
working
out
these
fit
perfectly
in
my
ear
and
the
hands
free
mode
is
awesome
definitely
recommend
these
to
allthe
only
thing
don't
like
is
where's
the
bass
but
then
again
understand
because
don't
want
busted
eardrumsthanks
for
such
and
awesome
product
and
great
price
the
sound
quality
is
quite
good,
it
is
suitable
for
those
who
listen
to
the
emotions
that
make
people
feel
very
happy
it
sounds
very
good
haven
felt
uncomfortable
after
wearing
it
for
long
time
it
is
suitable
for
sports
as
well
my
friend
was
attracted
to
my
new
earphones
was
so
glad
that
chose
this
one
usually
go
for
major
name
brand
when
it
comes
to
electronics
because
the
quality
is
typically
much
better
as
well
as
the
warranty
but
took
chance
on
these
because
of
the
many
excellent
reviews
they
work
really
good
at
the
gym
and
even
keep
wind
out
while
riding
my
bike
very
impressed
and
will
see
how
they
last
on
my
trip
to
disneyland
in
couple
weeks
great
sound
the
volumn
goes
very
loud
sounds
clear
fit
great
in
my
ears
and
don
move
at
all
even
when
working
out
didn't
really
expect
this
headphones
to
be
that
incredible
since
it's
only
dollars
am
totally
happy
about
my
investment
they
cancelled
all
the
outside
noise
they
have
pretty
good
sound
and
am
amazed
about
the
battery
life
if
you
are
looking
for
cheap
bluetooth
headphones
than
you
are
looking
at
the
right
product
absolutely
no
bass,
it's
like
listening
to
am
radio
if
they
had
better
sound
would've
kept
them
sending
back,
my
music
and
movies
have
to
have
great
sound
quality
it's
what
get
for
trying
to
go
cheap
when
run
or
drive,
it
uncomfortable
to
use
headphone
with
thread
the
first
time
see
this
wireless
bluetooth
headphone,
want
to
buy
it
when
use
it,
think
it
is
the
best
wireless
bluetooth
headphone
have
ever
purchased
have
used
this
headset
for
three
days
and
almost
full
power,
very
nice
what's
more,
the
sound
quality
is
very
good
like
it
very
much
great
product
use
them
while
running
they
stay
in
even
through
the
sweat
ok
so
it
came
so
fast
ordered
it
yesterday
morning
it
was
delivered
before
got
off
work
everything
about
this
is
great
except
ive
had
to
charge
it
twice
today
shouldnt
have
to
it
charged
all
night
maybe
did
something
wrong
but
hate
that
the
battery
doesnt
last
all
day
awesome
love
these
they
charge
your
phone
they
last
long
time
i'm
in
love
got
these
for
my
year
old
son
for
his
birthday
he
said
they
are
the
best
he
has
owned
yet
work
well
for
the
cost
the
battery
life
is
huge
they
sound
better
than
any
other
have
heard
they
are
user
friendly
they
light
indicators
have
no
regrets
love
the
fact
that
they
work
as
power
bank
for
your
phone
that's
one
less
thing
in
my
pocket
the
sound
quality
of
the
earbuds
are
great
however
did
not
like
the
size
of
them
they
felt
bulks
and
heave
in
my
ear
it
might
be
ok
if
there
was
cord
to
them,
but
they
kept
falling
out
of
my
ears
not
great
for
running
honestly
like
everything
about
this
product
audiobook
and
music
listener
and
couldn
hav
asked
for
better
earphone
the
price
is
perfect
for
it
the
best
earbuds
i've
owned
so
far
they
effectively
cancelled
out
any
background
noises
and
the
sound
quality
was
great
the
battery
life
was
also
reasonably
long
and
it
didn't
take
long
to
recharge
it
really
recommened
these
if
you're
going
for
quality
earbuds
that
are
still
affordable
love
the
case
they
sit
in
and
charge
in
and
easy
to
charge
they
do
get
little
heavy
after
extended
use,
but
otherwise
they
are
great
wireless
ear
buds,
plus
you
can
pause
your
video
with
light
tap
to
the
earbud
it's
nice
so
far
it
always
feels
like
they're
going
to
fall
out
and
slightly
irritating
the
ear
canal
but
if
you
feel
past
it
you'll
live
the
charging
cable
is
no
longer
than
inches
so
buy
another
one
or
scavenge
an
old
one
audio
will
also
cut
out
and
stop
playing
music
but
usually
reconnects
after
seconds
these
are
0%
the
best
earbuds
i've
ever
owned
better
than
$0
set
of
bose
earbuds
hands
down
these
are
the
first
buds
purchased
and
love
them
died
after
few
months
the
sound
quality
is
very
good
better
then
air
pods
in
my
opinion
also
the
comfort
level
is
very
good
stays
in
the
ear
don
have
to
worry
about
them
falling
out
during
my
workouts
and
morning
runs
only
thing
is
can
get
them
to
skip
the
track
forward
but
ve
only
had
for
couple
days
so
sure
ll
figure
it
out
over
well
worth
the
money
they
were
great
headphones
but
after
about
weeks
the
left
one
began
to
play
really
soft
week
after
that
it
completely
stopped
working
keep
them
in
my
car
for
back
up
now
they
don
stay
in
too
great,
if
wasn
wearing
headband
over
them
they
tend
to
fall
out
this
product
worked
like
charm,
make
sure
to
research
for
earbuds
extensively
and
this
one
had
the
most
legit
reviews
and
promised
the
longest
battery
life
battery
life
is
most
important
for
me
when
received,
the
noise
cancellation
was
definitely
not
lie
and
the
bass
was
more
then
ever
expected
for
wireless
earbudsno
regrets
the
ear
buds
are
great
the
sound
quality
is
good
the
battery
seems
to
last
forever
the
stay
in
my
ears
no
matter
what
i'm
doing
and
are
comfortable
very
happy
with
them
and
would
recomend
them
thisis
was
purchased
for
my
son
he
says
they
are
very
good
much
better
than
what
he
has
used
in
the
past
these
headphones
fit
in
my
ear
nicely
have
small
everything,
so
other
headphones
are
too
big
and
fall
out
really
like
these
customer
service
is
top
notch
they
helped
me
when
was
having
pairing
issues
they
sent
me
video
of
how
to
pair
them
good
people
nice
product
for
the
price
have
purchased
these
for
work
and
play
the
ear
buds
are
simple
to
work
and
have
nice
sound
to
them
would
like
them
to
be
bit
louder
but
still
are
great
lightweight
earbuds
that
fit
perfectly
when
doing
sports
bluetooth
connection
is
easy
to
use
battery
lasts
long
enough
for
most
sports
events

pasonomi
and
they

sincerely,
peter
ahn
the
only
thing
these
ear
buds
are
good
for
is
music
you
can't
talk
on
the
phone
without
it
constantly
disconnecting
and
then
pairing
again
amazing
by
far
the
best
ear
buds
ve
ever
had
they
are
easy
to
use
and
don
feel
cheap
at
all
amazing
for
the
price
works
really
great
sounds
great
so
had
them
for
week
and
working
great,
wind
does
effect
them
not
so
much
for
me
but
who
am
talking
toso
wanted
to
change
the
rubber
part
that
go
in
the
ear
and
the
screen
broke
off
so
there
sthat
so
not
sure
if
would
recommend
them
the
search
continues
for
the
right
pair
of
ear
buds
$0
dollars
gone
but
not
forgotten
earbuds
pair
and
connect
to
devices
easily,
and
really
like
having
the
option
to
use
only
one
also
really
enjoy
that
the
charging
station
serves
as
power
bank
i've
been
using
them
pretty
frequently
since
they
arrived,
and
i'm
pleased
with
the
range,
sound
quality,
and
battery
life
worst
buy,
not
loud,
sound
sucks,
bought
february
and
the
left
ear
bud
stopped
working
this
is
very
good
sound
quality
earphone,
they
perfectly
plug
on
my
ears
without
any
uncomfortable
feeling
and
moreover,
the
earphone
connect
to
my
device
quickly
bravo
worked
well
for
the
first
months
but
now
they
are
not
as
loud
as
they
used
to
be
use
them
to
listen
to
music
while
working
great
sound,
easy
to
pair,
love
all
the
charging
features
would
buy
again
they
worked
great
until
they
didn
use
these
to
run
in,
they
were
perfect,
until
after
couple
months,
and
then
the
right
ear
only
kind
of
works
it
very
very
very
faint,
even
on
full
volume,
left
one
works
fine,
but
you
literally
can
hardly
hear
anything
out
of
the
right
earbud
only
after
two
months
loved
them,
until
it
unfortunately
stopped
working
like
the
headphones
very
much,
the
battery
is
very
good,
it
can
be
used
for
long
time
the
size
is
also
suitable
for
my
ears,
and
it
is
very
comfortable
to
wear
for
long
time
in
addition,
the
sound
quality
is
not
bad,
the
sound
insulation
is
good
like
it
very
much
great
headphones
for
the
gym,
they
do
not
get
in
the
way
and
stay
in
place
like
that
they
are
so
small
so
they
dont
get
in
the
way
of
my
hair
or
anything
not
recommended
bought
them
for
my
husband
and
he
was
complaining
about
the
battery
and
noise
so
had
to
return
them
best
buy
of
the
year
use
them
all
day
love
that
can
use
individual
buds
or
pair
them
as
well
the
case
holds
my
charge
for
about
days
they're
fine
until
they
randomly
disconnect
and
they're
basically
useless
under
0%
battery
it
will
silence
whatever
you're
listening
to
to
tell
you
the
battery
is
low
literally
every
seconds
and
the
low
battery
warning
lasts
full
ten
seconds
it's
annoying
as
shit
don't
buy
these
retarded
things
do
really
like
these
but
must
say
that
the
battery
life
is
falling
short
if
you
use
both
at
the
same
time
you
will
get
hours
of
battery
life
if
you
use
only
one
you
get
about
hours
of
life
out
of
it
the
battery
pack
that
it
comes
with
is
great
and
charges
them
really
well
was
little
skeptical
having
read
few
reviews
of
these
ear
buds
surprise
it
turns
out
the
product
and
instructions
are
jam
up
and
excellent
no,
they
are
not
highend
wireless
buds,
but
they
sound
great,
are
waterproof,
and
pair
as
described
worth
the
price
and
totally
reliable
this
product
was
great
until
one
earphone
stopped
working
couple
months
into
having
them
bought
warranty
so
thought
it
would
be
easy
to
replace
them
but
it's
been
two
months
since
filed
the
claim
and
still
no
response
from
the
seller
i'm
out
bucks
and
i'm
furious
this
product
is
great,
generally
use
my
earbuds
in
the
bathroom,
but
with
these
can
even
shower
in
summary,
they
are
great,
for
the
price
they
sound
really
good
and
has
decent
battery
and
bass,
totally
recommended
sound
is
great
for
the
gym
my
only
bummer
is
when
talking
on
phone
people
say
my
voice
is
garbled
so
just
won
answer
the
phone
in
the
gym
was
always
looking
for
true
wirefree
bluetooth
headphone
and
pasonomi
is
exactly
what
was
looking
for
it
is
relatively
cheaper
than
most
of
the
major
brands
the
battery
is
good,
the
sound
is
good
and
gets
paired
to
laptop
or
phones
quite
easily
very
satisfied
man
received
these
today
and
can
believe
how
good
they
are
needs
little
more
bass
but
my
go
to
feature
is
you
can
adjust
volume
with
these
and
not
need
your
phone
pairing
was
less
than
seconds
as
well
definitely
recommend
these
are
truly
amazing
the
sound
quality
is
outstanding
whether
you're
working
out
or
doing
basic
daily
projects
they
are
perfect
purchased
other
brands
&
they
were
the
worst
all
the
way
around
should
have
stuck
with
my
original
purchase
but
chose
the
others
based
on
the
description
do
yourself
favor
and
look
no
further
nice
sound
and
they
actually
stay
in
my
ears
but
the
battery
doesn
even
last
hours
not
disappointed
great
fit,
sound
quality
is
good
love
that
able
to
use
the
case
to
charge
my
phone,
that
great
feature
highly
recommend
these
wireless
earbuds
these
are
great
headphones
run
hard
in
them
outside
and
the
sound
quality
is
great
also
take
work
calls
when
out
and
again
they
are
more
than
up
to
the
job
ve
been
spending
the
past
two
years
on
ear
buds
that
are
both
wired
and
burn
out
quickly
and
encouraged
that
spent
little
extra
and
bought
quality
product
this
time
around
it
works
fine
beside
the
right
earbud
seems
to
be
quite
bit
quieter
than
the
left
when
playing
music
tried
the
same
headphone
in
both
ears
to
make
sure
it
wasn
me
battery
life
ain
nothing
special
but
it
connects
quickly
and
gets
right
to
playing
music
would
still
buy
again
it
nice
with
all
of
the
equipment
that
it
came
with,
extra
rubber
earbuds
little
satchel
to
put
your
earbuds
and
charger
into
and
charger
cable
you
can
also
charge
your
mobile
phone
with
it
as
well
poor
quality
headphone
literally
no
noise
cancelling
poor
form
fitting
and
worried
about
them
popping
out
half
the
time
the
music
quality
is
sub
par
and
the
pairing
system
only
works
0%
of
the
time
only
good
thing
is
that
the
power
bank
case
has
huge
charge
so
usually
lasts
me
month
great
headphones
good
sound
quality
with
really
comfortable
fit
typically
can't
wear
ear
buds
for
longer
than
0minutes
without
them
irritating
my
ears,
but
have
no
issues
with
these
at
all
they
also
come
with
different
attachments
for
the
headphones
depending
on
your
ear
size
for
better
experience
great
ear
buds
if
you
use
one
at
time
great
for
talking
on
the
phone
if
you
use
both
not
the
greatest
great
pair
of
wireless
headphones
at
reasonable
price
i've
been
wanting
to
purchase
pair
of
wireless
headphones
for
few
months,
but
kept
putting
it
off,
until
found
these
great
design
and
fit,
excellent
charging
case,
good
battery
life
and
affordable
what
else
could
you
ask
for
no
surrounding
noise
cancellation
it
actually
magnifies
it
over
your
own
voicemain
thing
was
that
charging
case
stopped
working
less
than
month
from
purchasing
product
support
team
was
not
helpful
had
to
go
through
amazon
customer
support
for
refund
use
these
every
day
for
running
i've
went
through
bunch
of
dif
types
of
earbuds
and
these
are
the
best
so
far
also
they've
lasted
longer
than
any
of
the
ones
i've
had
prior
pleasantly
surprised
with
this
purchase
battery
last
decent
amount
of
time
connection
and
audio
quality
is
fabulous
the
case
also
doubles
as
portable
charger
for
my
phone
and
holds
charge
way
longer
than
thought
it
would
very
happy
with
this
purchase
would
absolutely
recommend
these
earbuds
are
great
well
designed,
made
very
wellthe
sound
quality
is
great,
no
wores,
wont
get
tangled
when
runningvery
clear
instructions,
great
customer
service
if
you
have
any
questions
the
charging
case
and
usb
cord
are
well
madethese
work
great
with
my
samsung
galaxy
note0
highly
recommend
good
value
sound
quality
very
good
little
over
hours
of
continuous
music
on
one
battery
charge
no
sound
distortion
on
high
notes
in
opera
overall
love
it
simple
&
efficienthowever,
there
are
some
areas
of
improvement
left
channel
is
the
master,
unlike
the
apple
pods
where
you
can
put
just
one
right
or
left
you
must
always
have
left
one
out
the
earbuds
fit
well
and
they
have
yet
to
fall
out
when
exercise
and
while
the
earbuds
themselves
don
last
for
longer
than
three
hours,
have
yet
to
run
into
any
real
issues
with
it
dying
when
am
doing
anything,
as
the
case
has
been
able
to
charge
it
up
enough
to
have
it
last
indefinitely
was
looking
for
good
pair
of
wireless
headphones,
and
these
fit
the
bill,
not
lot
of
bass,
but
wasn
looking
for
bass
paired
up
easy
with
my
phone
and
controls
are
easy
to
use
use
these
earplugs
to
listen
to
music,
movies
and
games
every
day
the
sound
quality
is
good
ultra
clear,
rich
bass
the
quality
of
construction
is
comparable
to
that
of
more
wellknown
companies
they
don't
think
it's
cheap
they
provide
excellent
battery
life
and
super
easy
connection
you
won't
be
disappointed
to
buy
these'
after
two
months
only
one
bud
would
sync
battery
life
deteriorates
quickly
battery
life
about
hr
min
after
first
dozen
uses
these
earbuds
are
great
it
fits
comfortably
and
the
sound
is
very
clear
the
charging
dock
doubles
as
charger
for
the
earbuds
and
for
your
phone
with
long
lasting
battery
life
have
not
need
to
charge
the
dock
much
since
got
it,
maybe
once
but
that
was
it
recommend
trying
these
earbuds
out
if
your
looking
for
great
quality
wireless
earbuds
bought
these
in
february
and
absolutely
loved
these
and
was
used
them
every
day
that
is
until
the
right
earbud
just
stopped
connecting
couple
weeks
ago
and
won't
work
no
matter
what
i've
tried
super
bummed
i'll
have
to
look
for
different
pair
and
little
put
out
spent
$0
on
something
that
didn't
even
work
0months
they
pair
up
easy
to
my
phone
sound
good
the
right
earbud
volume
went
to
0%
of
the
left
earbud
after
months
of
use
i've
had
this
for
tad
under
months
now,
the
battery
life
has
gone
to
the
gutter
in
this
time
cant
get
through
an
entire
gym
session
before
they
die
when
the
battery
actually
lasted,
loved
these
but
now
i'm
gonna
have
to
trash
em
and
invest
in
new
pair
elsewhere
the
earbuds
are
really
goodthey
don't
go
too
deep
into
the
ear
canal
which
is
plus
you
can
also
add
different
sizes
to
help
reduce
noisei
went
for
jog
and
the
connection
with
both
earbuds
did
not
drop
oncei
would
recommend
these
as
they
are
fair
for
their
price
the
sound
quality
is
superb,
and
there
are
some
exciting
extra
features
that
aren
in
the
instructions
like
being
able
to
pause/play
and
use
siri
by
touching
the
right
and
left
earbud
respectively
the
instruction
booklet
is
little
unclear,
but
once
you
pair
the
earbuds
with
your
device
it
smooth
sailing
ordered
this
product
for
running
and
working
out
not
having
to
worry
about
wire
connection
is
great
love
the
sound,
the
comfort
and
the
fact
that
they
charge
in
the
caseafter
using
mine
and
liking
them,
bought
another
set
for
my
daughter
birthday
and
she
loves
them
honestly
loved
these
earphones
so
much
they
had
long
battery
life,
fit
well
in
my
ears,
and
the
sound
was
great
however,
month
in
the
headphones
stopped
working
there
is
no
damage
to
these
ear
phones
at
all,
take
great
care
of
them,
so
it
was
very
disappointing
to
see
would
not
purchase
these
again
love
the
earbuds
the
music
quality
is
great
they
cancel
out
noise
they
fit
well
in
my
ears
able
to
exercise
on
my
bike
without
worrying
about
them
ok
foreign
misinstructions
on
how
to
link
took
three
tries
got
faulty
earphones
which
tried
to
return
but
for
some
reason
they
did
not
receive
the
return
and
so
haven't
got
my
refund
also
its
been
only
few
months
and
the
left
bud
is
not
working
like
it
used
to
having
low
volume
in
left,
and
high
in
right
think
this
bluetooth
earbuds
are
too
hard
and
it
hurts
when
wear
them
more
than
minutes
cannot
imagine
wearing
this
and
work
out
just
received
this
item
today
but
am
returning
them
due
to
an
unpleasing
ear
fit
sound
quality
was
very
decent
and
the
earbud
container
also
held
good
amount
of
charge,
getting
my
phone
to
about
half
if
didn't
have
an
outlet
nearby
the
only
problem
is
that
wireless
earbuds
are
really
easy
to
lose,
so
keep
them
in
their
case
when
you're
not
using
them
lol
the
earbuds
work
great
and
have
great
fit
like
using
them
around
the
house
the
never
slip
and
connect
to
bluetooth
flawlessly
only
issue
is
they
have
tinging
sound
that
sometimes
happens
and
can
be
annoying
but
i'm
used
to
wired
headphones
with
better
base
but
the
wireless
is
great
so
cant
complain
too
much
each
earbud
lasts
about
hours
so
far
the
only
complaint
have
is
when
using
the
earbuds
separately
there
is
no
volume
control
on
the
earbuds
themselves
which
can
make
them
rather
quiet
when
using
both
pair
though
it
is
easy
enough
to
get
loud
clear
sound
from
them
excellent
quality
and
sound,
noise
cancellation
is
great
very
comfortable,
perfect
fit
for
myself,
my
spouse
and
even
my
children
come
in
great
little
charging
box,
which
is
very
easy
to
use
would
definitely
purchase
again
i'm
pretty
rough
with
my
headphones
gym
bag,
sauna,
sweat,
no
cleaning,
etc
and
these
are
still
hanging
in
there
after
months
connection
process
is
bit
wonky
and
don't
actually
know
if
know
how
to
turn
them
off
tried
to
pare
them
0x
first
attempts
nothing,
then
one
then
both
by
the
last
timeit
also
took
0x
to
pare
to
the
phone
no
sound
at
all
ever
and
powered
off
by
itself
after
mins
charged
them
overnight
these
earbuds
are
garbage
i'm
on
my
second
pair
first
pair
had
hardware
issue
after
about
days
and
wouldn't
charge
one
side
second
pair
seems
to
have
hardware
failure
with
one
side
playing
muffled/lower
tried
to
reset
the
earbuds
several
times
and
no
success
i'm
returning
them
again
and
getting
something
decent
from
company
that
knows
how
to
make
earbuds
very
good
working
time
sound
ok
and
verey
good
price
eazy
connecting
the
only
thing
dislike
is
that
the
case
is
so
big
can
not
bot
it
in
my
baket
comfortable
it
is
great
that
it
can
charge
it
meany
time
but
prefer
it
smaller
found
my
self
living
the
case
in
home
when
go
out
but
it
does
hold
lot
of
charge
it
is
great
indoors
for
listening
however,
outdoors
the
connection
is
not
great
and
the
sound
keeps
interrupting,
even
when
you
hold
your
phone
nearby
in
your
handthe
mic
is
not
sensitive,
you
sort
of
need
to
scream
for
the
other
party
to
hear
you
too
big
read
few
reviews
of
the
sound
quality
being
terrible
ignored
the
messages
is
as
that
said
the
bass
was
terrible
it
is
true
sound
sucks
don
except
bose
quality
sound
level
but
these
aren
good
it
when
we
re
valued
at
$0
would
take
them,
but
not
thesealso,
called
people
and
got
you
sound
crackled
you
sound
broken
you
sound
like
you
re
in
bathroom
so
returning
these
and
sticking
with
my
bulky
soundwhiz
brand
me
agradó

este

purchased
as
gift
within
about
uses
while
exercising
the
right
ear
bud
stopped
working
received
replacement
set
and
the
same
thing
happened
did
all
the
recommended
trouble
shooting,
but
nothing
helped
research
better
set
of
blue
tooth,
wireless
earbuds
do
not
purchase
these
sometimes
the
right
one
won
connect
says
it
powered
on
but
no
music
i've
been
using
the
headphones
while
running
at
the
gym
with
no
problems
they
fit
and
stay
in
ear
quite
well
charging
them
is
also
very
simple
with
magnetic
snap
on
in
the
case
so
you
know
earpods
are
charging
they
also
autoconnect
or
turn
off
once
you
move
them
in
and
out
of
the
case
so
connecting
the
bluetooth
is
no
hassle
hurt
like
hell
ears
are
sore
to
the
touch
controls
are
not
user
friendly
sensitive
to
the
touch
double
tap
motions
control
the
budsjust
awful
liked
the
bluetooth
earbuds
very
much
they
have
great
sound
quality
and
are
very
useful
for
multiple
things
you
can
also
listen
to
good
music
without
static
wore
them
for
an
entire
day
without
having
to
charge
them
so
think
that
that
is
very
good
this
item
is
both
good
in
quality
and
price
it
was
worth
it
the
fit,
sound,
quality
for
these
bluetooth
earbuds
are
awesome
once
you
find
the
perfect
size
to
put
on
your
earbuds
they
fit
great
love
that
it
has
touch
stop/play
for
your
music
on
both
earbuds
instead
of
other
ones
you
have
to
really
push
on
to
get
the
music
to
play
or
stop
playing
would
purchase
these
again
sounds
great
once
put
different
ear
tips
on
from
the
last
set
that
didn't
work
very
well
but
sounded
good
when
they
did
got
an
idea
to
change
the
good
eartips
from
the
bad
ear
buds
to
the
good
ear
buds
it
worked
wonderfully
am
still
listing
to
my
my
music
list
right
now
great
set
of
bluetooth
ear
buds
solid,
easy
to
pair,
great
sound,
and
awesome
battery

love
that
they

pretty
good,
sometimes
you
have
to
make
minor
adjustment
the
only
thing
that
feel
it
is
lacking
is
when
your
on

the
person
on
the
other
end
has
hard
time
hearing

the

life
is
great
and
as
advertised
the

isn't
strong,
but
these
are
great
for
running
i've
been
running
with
them
times
week
for
about
months
now,
and
have
only
had
to
charge
the
case
times
really
happy
with
this
product,
especially
for
when
travel
able
to
listen
to
music
or
watch
movie
with
great
sound
they
fit
comfortable
and
like
that
not
constantly
untangling
wires
great
purchase,
highly
recommend
like
the
quality
the
comfort
charging
case
is
awesome
how
ever
you
can
only
use
the
right
earbud
independent
the
left
wont
connect
to
phone
links
to
other
earbud
battery
life
is
bit
below
advertised
they
do
charge
very
quickly
though
broke
after
only
months
it
will
not
charge
anymore
missed
my
return
date
by
days
loved
it
when
it
worked
now
hate
it
and
can't
get
my
money
back
easy
to
install,
wish
you
didn't
have
to
disconnect
from
one
device
and
connect
to
another
every
time
you
switch
sound
quality
ok,
battery
life
about
hours
these
are
really
nice
earphones,i
wear
them
every
time
during
workout
and
they
are
very
comfortablethe
only
thing
is
they
are
not
good
for
calling
as
the
mic
does
not
pics
up
voice
every
timethey
have
really
good
battery
life
and
charging
case
is
small
and
handy
and
lasts
long
once
charged
loved
the
sound
quality
for
about
weeks,
but
the
left
earbud
lost
the
majority
of
its
sound
for
seemingly
no
reason
just
spend
some
extra
money
for
the
apple
airpods
these
are
very
low
quality
easy
to
use
no
cords
waterproof
even
tried
them
in
the
shower,
and
they
worked
great
they
do
cancel
noise,
but
have
yet
to
find
one
that
completely
blocks
all
the
noise
though
play
around
with
the
tips
to
get
secure
fit
and
the
best
noise
cancellation
possible
the
earbud
fits
well
and
its
comfortable
to
wear
the
volume
is
pretty
good
very
high
and
the
connection
process
is
easy
not
sure
yet
about
the
battery,
but
i'm
happy
with
the
product
until
now
sound
is
good
and
the
kids
like
them
product
was
great
out
of
the
box
after
weeks
they
barely
have
any
sound
coming
out
of
them
extremely
disappointing
used
it
for
few
months
and
then
they
just
stopped
working
they
still
say
they
are
pairing,
but
no
sound
comes
out
read
lot
of
reviews
before
purchased,
and
was
encouraged
thought
the
sound
was
tinny,
and
they
didn
stay
in
my
ears
returned
them
:
these
fit
well
and
sound
good
my
one
complaint
is
that
the
docking
is
tricky
and
have
drained
the
batteries
couple
times
it
sounds
really
decent
and
it
holds
really
well
in
my
ear
solid
earbuds
for
the
price
use
them
every
day
at
the
gym
and
while
commuting
to
workyou
can
also
use
just
one
earbud
at
time
if
you
want,
which
is
useful
when
i'm
working
at
my
desk
my
left
earbuds
bluetooth
is
not
working
could
not
use
one
month
now
it
problem
on
left
earbuds
can
hearing
anything
from
left
earbuds
what
is
the
solution
thank
you
got
these
for
my
fiancé
as
christmas
present
&
he
loves
them
they
are
super
easy
to
use
the
battery
last
very
long
time
was
concerned
with
how
well
they
would
stay
in
the
ears
but
they
actually
fit
perfect
it
comes
with
different
rubber
pieces
for
different
ear
sizes
absolutely
love
these
water
resistant
sweat
resistant
go
to
the
gym
and
for
runs
and
they
stay
in
place
the
noise
cancellation
is
amazing
it's
great
snug
fit
inside
my
ear
they
came
with
multiple
sizes
to
adjust
the
ear
piece
so
that
was
great
absolutely
love
these
would
have
given
much
higher
review,
but
one
of
the
earbuds
started
to
fall
apart
after
about
month
if
that
earbud
had
stayed
together
would
have
given
these
star
review
sound
quality,
pairing
and
battery
life
are
all
good
wish
that
that
did
not
get
defective
unit
update
at
months
one
of
the
earbuds
stopped
working
totally
useless
now
do
not
waste
your
money
good
fit
size
options,
loud
enough
to
wear
on
loud
harley
motorcycle
at
freeway
speeds
battery
life
is
good
they
have
only
gone
dead
once
while
wearing
after
most
of
the
day
super
easy
to
recharge
in
carrying
case
which
doubles
as
phone
charger
as
well
very
convenient
to
be
able
to
wear
one
at
time
charge
is
quickly
and
efficiently
and
easy
to
connect
also
it
can
use
as
power
bank
also
very
convenient
very
great
product
if
you
ever
lose
one
they
are
very
helpful
in
getting
another
replacement
to
you
love
them
these
are
good
ear
buds
,
definitely
worth
buying
good
sounds
quality,
use
them
in
the
gym
everyday
and
they
stay
in
place
the
battery
is
surprisingly
good
in
the
case,
takes
while
before
the
case
needs
to
be
recharged
these
wireless
headphones
work
great
as
they
easily
connect
with
my
phone
for
listening
to
music
and
more
they
work
just
as
well
as
my
daughter's
more
pricey
airpods
bought
these
for
my
year
old
for
christmas
and
she
loves
them
they
are
great
quality
and
the
customer
service
is
awesome
my
daughter
ended
up
cracking
the
charging
box
and
the
company
replaced
it
for
free
would
buy
again
and
recommend
to
anyone
looking
for
wireless
ear
buds
these
are
exactly
what
was
looking
for
comfortable
and
good
sound
easy
to
use
no
issues
nice
to
have
battery
backup
in
the
case
as
well
just
wanted
to
say
that
these
arrived
super
fast
got
them
for
my
husband
to
use
for
listening
to
music
and
he
loved
them
will
be
purchasing
another
set
for
myself
as
well
as
for
my
college
daughter
good
product
like
the
product
just
haven
been
able
to
figure
out
how
to
use
only
one
earbud,
it
picks
up
noise
around
me
really
easy
making
it
hard
for
people
to
hear
me
when
talking
to
them
but
when
it
quiet
around
me
they
work
great
and
they
re
very
comfortable
to
wear
these
are
awesome
they
work
as
described
and
the
battery
life
is
really
good
they
stay
in
while
exercising
and
have
good
sound
quality
the
case
both
charges
them
and
has
usb
to
charge
your
phone
if
needed
would
recommend
to
anyone
great
product
the
reason
why
i'm
not
giving
stars
is
because
lot
of
times
it
doesn't
connect
to
my
phone
even
though
it
says
it's
connected
it
won't
play
the
music
really
loved
these
headphones
at
first,
build
quality
seems
great,
rechargable
case
with
extra
battery
and
ability
to
charge
your
phone
all
great
things
sound
wasn't
perfect
but
they
worked,
however
one
of
the
speakers
just
stopped
working
way
too
huge
for
my
ears
don't
know
why
when
searched
for
another
brand
earbud,
this
one
pops
up
to
the
top
sound
quality
doesn't
meet
expectation
the
volume
of
one
side
is
less
than
the
other
side
right
earbud
died
within
month
of
owning
product
the
'mic'
is
basically
useless
when
making
phone
calls
it
sounds
like
your
being
gagged
with
aluminum
foil
while
being
drowned
in
bathtub
battery
life
is
fine,
but
doesn't
do
much
good
with
such
garbage
product
don't
buy
got
these
wireless
earphones
because
do
not
like
the
the
iphone
ear
phones
and
didn
want
to
pay
for
the
apple
ipods
but
now
am
these
head
phone
are
horrible
when
it
came
to
trying
to
hold
conversation
with
someone
either
was
told
sounds
very
far
away
or
they
couldn
hear
me
at
all
but
what
do
like
about
them
is
that
can
easily
listen
to
music
on
them
with
no
problems
gret
earbuds
for
the
price
haven't
had
any
issues
with
them
and
the
bonus
of
the
case
being
power
bank
is
awesome
love
these
earbuds
have
small
ears
and
have
always
had
hard
time
finding
ones
that
will
stay
in
and
still
feel
comfortable,
these
are
amazing
because
they
come
with
two
different
sizes
to
fit
your
needs
the
sound
quality
is
awesome
and
had
no
trouble
pairing
them
to
my
iphone,
highly
recommend
theses
are
amazing
and
cut
down
ambient
sound
very
easy
to
pair
would
purchase
again
these
headphones
are
quite
amazing,
when
need
to
charge
on
the
go
i'm
prepared
with
this
whenever
forget
my
portable
charger
at
home
the
music
quality
isn
too
shabby
better
than
some
other
earphones
have
used
think
that
its
def
worth
for
the
price
could
be
better
if
they
made
the
earphones
last
to
whole
day
good
these
are
the
only
way
listen
to
music
now
was
surprised
how
great
the
sound
quality
was
from
the
small
earbuds
also
love
the
charging
aspect
of
it
can
wear
them
while
on
the
max,
take
them
off
and
when
i'm
ready
for
them
they're
fully
charged
i'd
recommend
these
to
anyone
was
nervous
because
hadn
heard
of
the
brand
before
but
honesty
it
has
been
great
the
pairing
could
be
little
easier
but
use
it
in
lab
and
at
the
gym
it
fantastic
liked
being
able
to
just
charge
the
case
every
so
often
over
charging
my
old
ear
buds
more
often
found
the
sound
quality
to
be
good
for
this
kind
of
audio
hardwarejust
don't
let
your
dog
have
them
mine
chewed
through
the
entire
charging
case
one
day,
think
i'll
be
buying
replacement
loved
these
headphones
but
over
the
last
week
or
so
the
volume
has
become
so
low
that
can
barely
hear
anything
with
the
headphones
and
the
phone
at
max
volume
t_r_u_m_p
i've
had
these
for
about
months
now
my
only
real
complaint
is
that
they
do
not
work
outside
when
outside,
the
sound
comes
on
and
off
every
couple
seconds
or
so
this
is
problem
since
bought
them
to
wear
while
walking
to
and
from
work
everyday
indoors
they
work
fine
would
not
buy
them
again
really
liked
theses
headphones
normally
cannot
get
earbuds
to
stay
in
my
ear
and
always
trying
to
fix
them
while
working
out
did
not
have
to
touch
these
once
during
my
workout
also
wore
these
when
went
for
walk
and
it
was
very
windy
out,
didn
get
any
sound
or
whooshing
noise
from
the
wind
very
good
sound
quality
sound
quality
ease
of
controls
perfect
fit
and
they
don
fall
out
of
ears
the
only
problem
have
its
that
can't
be
used
one
at
time
you
can
only
use
the
left
side
unless
you
leave
it
out
to
use
the
right
side
which
kind
of
defeats
the
purpose
of
the
charging
case
but
overall
good
product
use
them
daily
and
they
are
amazing
stay
away
if
you
are
looking
for
anything
more
than
an
extra
battery
had
to
turn
all
the
way
up
to
hear
welllittle
to
no
bass
thought
these
were
the
same
as
previously
owned
pair
and
was
sorely
mistaken
well
the
box
looks
little
bit
old,
am
not
sure
if
it
is
over
handling
the
earbuds
are
good
and
easy
to
use
heard
about
the
headphones
from
my
friends
he
told
me
these
headphone
have
good
quality,
so
bought
this
product
use
these
headphones
for
listening
music
the
sound
quality
is
very
good
these
headphones
help
me
sleep
well
love
the
sound
and
the
easy
charging
box
that
comes
with
it
awesome
earbuds
i've
had
of
these
and
each
one
of
them
has
tendency
to
lose
sound
in
one
bud
over
time
they're
great
earbuds
with
really
long
battery
life,
but
if
your
phone
doesn't
have
sound
equalizer
for
left
and
right
channels,
you
may
find
it
extremely
annoying
if
the
balance
is
off
love
these
headphones
the
battery
lasts
for
about
to
hours
before
needing
charge,
charges
up
pretty
quick,
has
good
connectivity,
and
the
sound
quality
is
pretty
solidthe
only
con
can
think
of
is
that
the
shape
of
the
buds
can
start
to
hurt
your
ears
after
prolonged
use
these
sounded
great
right
out
of
the
box
these
earbuds
work
great
had
small
problem
with
one
and
the
customer
service
team
sent
me
out
new
pair
quickly
the
new
pair
is
working
perfectly
alright
as
long
as
you
don
move
good
for
sitting
at
desk
use
it
primarily
when
am
riding
my
bike
to/from
work
easy
access
to
answer
calls
and
move
forward
from
song
to
song
received
call
while
riding
and
it
clear
both
ways
so
far
so
good
would
review
english
instructions
as
it
seems
it
was
not
written
by
native
speaker
these
are
by
far
the
best
wireless
earbuds
on
amazon
currently
everything
about
it
is
amazing,
unfortunately
the
sound
quality
isn't
as
good
as
wanted,
but
it
isn't
nothing
that
can't
be
fixed
with
bit
of
tweaking
on
your
phone
overall,
it's
great
product
worked
great
at
first
and
then
one
side
stopped
working
troubleshooted
with
an
agent
and
it
still
didn't
work
had
to
return
it
how
to
used
earphones
independently
the
rigth
one
can
only
used
the
left
one
:
haven't
had
this
product
over
months
and
one
of
the
ear
buds
has
stopped
working
really
disappointed
with
these
earbuds
the
earbuds
are
only
good
for
few
weeks
and
then
start
acting
strange
sometimes
there
is
static
when
talking
on
the
phone
this
is
my
second
pair,
and
it
still
does
have
the
same
problem
some
other
times,
the
right
earbud
doesn
worki
have
somewhat
lost
faith
in
the
wireless
headphones
as
well
as
earbuds
am
going
back
to
the
wires
got
these
over
the
other
ones
that
had
stars
because
on
these
you
can
charge
your
phone
on
the
case
these
are
some
great
headphones,
the
only
complaint
is
that
at
first
the
headphones
feel
uncomfortable
in
your
ear
but
you
get
used
to
it
these
headphones
are
great
for
their
price
you
get
what
you
pay
for
comfortable
clealy
fashion
easy
to
assemblehandsfree
changed
my
review
at
first
they
weren
functioning
properly
and
the
sound
kept
glitching
out
and
cutting
off
but
guessing
it
because
didn
let
them
charge
first
before
using
them
upon
opening
once
charged
they
started
to
work
without
any
issue
the
seller
reached
out
and
were
very
helpful
first
off
all
can
say
this
headphone
is
great,
before
that
got
differen
brand
bluetooth
headphone
but
they
did
not
work
well,
now
it
has
great
sound
quality
and
so
practical
,
and
look
so
classy
0/0
can
give
for
this
headphone
,
and
last
one
price
is
adorable
it
very
easy
to
control
use,
sound
very
clean
clear
and
love
the
charger
love
it,
very
helpful
and
handy,
and
the
price
is
very
economical,
very
happy
just
had
to
submit
this
review,
as
washed
one
of
the
buds
by
accident
didn't
realize
it
until
it
fell
out
of
the
dryer
miraculously,
put
it
to
charge,
and
it
worked
was
then
able
to
sync
and
listen
to
the
music
great
product,
great
quality
very
comfortable
to
wear,
they
sound
great,
love
the
case/charger
comfortable
in
the
ear
these
fit
in
my
ears
really
well
and
have
great
sound
the
price
is
very
reasonable
for
wireless
earbuds
think
the
control
to
skip,
pause,
volume
etc
is
pretty
innovative
and
easy
to
use
i'm
very
happy
with
these
earbuds
and
the
quality
these
wireless
earbuds
are
good
it
has
great
battery
life,
strong
reliable
connect,
and
good
audio
quality
the
design
is
simple
and
easy
to
usei
purchased
this
for
music
while
running,
the
fit
is
good
even
while
running
this
product
is
wonderful
use
it
at
work
and
can
wander
pretty
far
away,
not
having
to
mess
with
cord
and
it's
great
my
only
qualm
is
that
they
aren't
that
hard
to
knock
out
of
your
ear
usually
they
don't
just
fall
out
but
small
nudge
can
be
enough
for
them
to
fall
out
of
your
ear
otherwise
awesome
product
love
these
omg
never
leave
the
house
without
and
they
are
0/0
of
the
price
of
apple
pods
so
glad
saved
my
money
and
bought
these
because
these
could
not
be
any
better
never
have
to
charge
the
case,
the
sound
is
great,
and
the
fit
is
comfortable
obsessed
save
your
bucks
these
earbuds
are
fairly
decent
quality
it's
little
frustrating
that
can't
keep
one
in
the
case,
and
only
wear
one,
without
it
disconnecting
altogether
that
aside,
i'm
disappointed,
that
after
only
one
month
of,
not
even
rigorous
use,
the
right
earbud
has
stopped
working
no
damage
has
been
done
to
it
at
all
i've
used
them
total
of
times,
and
they've
only
been
in
my
ear,
or
in
the
case
:/
very
easy
to
pair
with
my
tablet,
sit
very
comfortable
within
my
kid's
ears,
turns
off
when
not
in
use
which
is
good
function
to
have
so
there
is
no
need
to
keep
charging
the
pieces
love
them,
used
them
everyday
for
two
months,
both
to
listen
to
music
and
for
phone
callsone
eventually
stopped
charging
and
soon
after
the
other
one
too
the
company
was
quick
to
provide
support
to
try
to
have
them
work
again
they
eventually
sent
me
another
pair
which
work
perfectly
great
customer
service
use
these
at
the
gym
and
they
are
great
the
touch
control
is
bit
confusing
for
me
and
sometimes
they
connect
or
disconnect
when
don
want
them
to
overall
glad
bought
them
had
them
while
now
i've
dropped
them
alot
even
fell
off
boat
into
the
river
with
them
in
my
pocket
and
they
still
working
good
buy
for
the
price
pasonomi
twsx0
bluetooth
wireless
headphones
are
surprising
nice
they
fit
in
my
ear
just
right
and
are
comfortable
quality
of
sounds
is
good
and
battery
life
is
good
my
grandson
loves
themi
have
pair
so
does
my
daughter
great
product
only
small
issue
had
were
the
rubber
parts
that
go
in
your
ear
they
were
little
too
hard
for
my
taste,
so
used
some
older
ones
had
no
wonder
they
were
so
easy
to
find
used
there
were
no
instructions
in
the
box
and
have
no
idea
how
to
pair
them
none
of
the
videos
are
very
helpful
and
neither
are
the
instructions
online,
so
can
only
manage
to
hear
out
of
one
of
the
earbuds
at
time
they
should
be
simple
to
pair
together
and
should
always
work
as
single
device
if
don't
find
way
to
make
these
work
together
soon,
i'm
getting
rid
of
them
the
speakers
are
very
clear
they
fit
well
in
my
ears
without
falling
out
battery
life
is
good
love
this
wireless
earbuds
because
they
sound
great,
and
are
comfortable
in
ear,
and
they
give
you
all
the
experience
you
expect
from
standard
bluetooth
earbuds
great,
exactly
as
advertised
it
is
very
good
because
able
to
cancel
all
noise
from
the
outside
even
if
put
it
on
the
lowest
volume
it
fits
perfectly
in
my
ear
it
easy
to
connect
and
easy
to
clean
rather
disappointed
they
are
uncomfortable
bulky
and
last
less
then
hours
when
fully
charged
would
not
recommend
use
them
all
day
to
include
running
never
fall
out
and
portable
battery
charger
let
me
take
them
everywhere
instructions
little
hard
to
read/understand
as
they
are
broken
english
worked
really
well
for
few
weeks
but
then
the
left
one
just
stopped
working,
not
sure
if
mines
just
defective
or
if
it
problem
for
the
overall
product
the
ear
buds
are
terrible,
even
when
first
got
them
the
sound
quality
is
not
good,
it
like
you
have
you
volume
close
to
the
minimum
even
twisting
and
turning
them
won
do
the
trick
the
only
thing
good
about
them
is
the
charging
case
wish
hadn
spend
my
$0
on
these
busts
the
worst
purchase
ever
couldnt
even
fund
the
return
feature
when
wanted
to
send
them
back
poor
battery
life,
charger
works
well
can't
have
one
charging
while
wearing
the
other
these
babies
stay
in
my
ears
through
runs
and
burpees
the
battery
life
is
long
enough
for
me,
and
even
when
they
start
running
low,
they
charge
super
fast
love
'em
and
would
definitely
recommend
them
to
friends
like
how
you
can
increase
and
reduce
the
volume
directly
from
the
devices
dont
think
the
more
expensive
apple
versions
can
do
this
it's
great
how
it
also
auto
pairs
and
connects
with
the
phone
as
soon
as
its
uncradled
got
it
as
bday
gift
and
im
really
pleased
good
battery
life
and
dont
hurt
my
ears
like
other
ear
buds
definately
buy
again
overall
good
pair
for
reasonable
price
case
they
store
in
is
good
also
has
battery
to
charge
them
or
phone
which
is
cool
they
sound
clear
volume
wise
they
could
be
bit
louder
but
that's
just
me
for
most
they'll
be
fine
magnetic
drop
in
is
convenient
for
charging
will
sync
up
even
when
just
the
left
ear
is
taken
out
right
side
doesn
t,
but
that
more
than
expected
anyway
perhaps
future
versions
will
do
that
so
you
can
switch
off
and
extend
use
by
using
one
ear
bud
at
time
buds
themselves
fit
comfortably
as
well
use
it
when
running
it
massless
and
never
dropped
also
can
easy
stop
ur
music
by
just
touch
the
earbuds
gave
as
gift,
nothing
but
praise
good
bluetooth
setup
good
battery
terrible
sound
quality
could
every
background
noise
had
to
go
back
to
over
the
ear
headphones
only
get
about
and
0/0
hours
listening
until
the
battery
dies
haven't
tried
using
just
one
of
your
bud,
and
then
popping
the
other
one
in
when
the
battery
starts
dying
just
ordered
these
and
so
far
they're
awesome
hope
they
work
forever
no
problems,
linked
up
to
bluetooth
instantly,
sound
is
great
good
earbuds
at
the
fraction
of
the
cost
of
airpods
one
even
went
through
the
wash
machine
and
still
worked
it
sounds
funny
but
still
works
sound
quality
is
very
good,
the
fit
is
amazing
and
pairing
to
phone
was
very
easy
my
first
set
wouldn
connect
at
the
same
time
no
matter
what
did
had
to
return
them
and
get
new
pair
my
second
pair
were
amazing
nothing
wrong
at
all
until
the
little
screen
in
the
earbud
fell
through
besides
that
great
earphone
for
the
price
great
product
at
such
an
affordable
price
love
that
the
case
is
also
for
recharging
the
battery
lasts
about
hours
and
they
re
comfortable
to
wear
would
definitely
buy
these
again
and
recommend
to
others
these
earbuds
worked
great
for
about
months
great
sound,
stayed
in
ears
during
exercise,
then
the
left
one
stopped
working
it
connects
but
can
barely
hear
anything
out
of
it,
just
whisper
so
basically
can
only
use
the
right
one
they
fit
like
dream
and
usually
in
ear
headphones
do
not
fit
my
ears
well
the
volume
is
great
very
loud
no
issues
with
cancelling
out
nearby
sounds
for
better
listening
the
only
downside
was
wish
there
was
little
more
bass
for
the
price
though
they
are
fantastic
still
on
my
first
charge
days
later
bought
this
as
gift
to
my
bf
but
when
he
uses
them
all
hear
are
background
noises
it
very
difficult
to
hear
him
speak
wish
was
able
to
return
them
wouldn
recommend
to
anyone
bad
quality
best
place
to
buy
from
works
great
ve
had
these
for
months
and
the
sound
is
already
shot
pansonomi,
id
be
willing
to
give
them
another
shot
if
you
send
me
new
pair
use
these
maybe
once
week
for
running
and
they
ve
never
gotten
wet
disappointing
they
didn
even
make
it
year
these
wireless
buds
were
great
deal
good
sound
and
awesome
battery
life
the
price
was
awesome
unfortunately,
they
became
unpaired
and
haven't
been
able
to
resync
them
it's
unfortunate
also,
when
charge
then
case
the
led
lights
no
longer
light
up
properly
maybe,
just
got
bad
set
up
however,
these
were
awesome
while
it
lasted
batter
life
is
not
good
am
only
able
to
use
for
about
hours
prior
to
having
to
recharge
also
the
sound
is
not
the
best
think
might
try
other
brands
it
keeps
disconnecting
from
my
iphone
and
connects
again
and
disconnects
again
and
keeps
doing
it
every
time
play
any
type
of
audiobut
it
did
work
on
my
computer
and
the
sound
was
good,
and
they
stay
in
fairly
well
these
are
the
real
deal
the
price
to
quality
ratio
is
unreal
love
these
even
use
them
in
the
shower
these
are
very
good
earbuds
and
at
very
reasonable
price
connectability
using
android
devices
recommend
this
product
sound
and
everything
perfect
i've
been
using
it
since
brought
it
it
works
perfect
fit
perfect
and
waterproof
love
it
so
have
been
wanting
wireless
earbuds
for
long
time
and
let
me
tell
you
that
these
do
not
disappoint
they
charge
quickly
are
super
easy
to
pair
with
your
devices
and
the
addition
of
having
charging
case
for
other
products
that
use
usb
at
the
same
time
is
amazing
out
of
if
you
want
an
amazing
product
here
they
are
look
no
further
like
it
because
it's
in
one
idea
you
can
listen
to
music,
answer
the
phone
and
also
can
charge
the
phone
cool
product,
really
enjoy
it
expected
more
for
the
price
paid
when
it's
working,
it's
wonderful
but
there
will
be
stints
where
it
constantly
disconnects
and
jumps
really
kills
the
mood
the
right
earbud
stopped
charging
after
months
used
them
for
running
but
was
extremely
disappointed
that
the
product
didn
last
it
would
be
great
if
they
sent
me
new
pair
hopefully
would
get
another
months
out
of
them
after
about
months,
the
earbugs
battery
started
to
go
bad
it
lasted
only
hrs
following
full
charge
the
connectivity
is
an
issue
as
well
the
sound
cuts
off
when
just
turn
my
heads
there
is
no
noise
cancelling
at
all
very
disappointed
cheap
and
effective
great
quality
for
the
price
stars
they're
good,
they're
loud,
and
the
battery
lasts
calls
are
perfect
and
they're
very
simple
to
use
they've
got
but
just
one
big
defect
the
buds
are
waaaay
to
small,
they
barely
cancel
out
everything
outside
had
to
replace
them
with
another
earbuds
that
had
from
another
bluetooth
device
for
that,
give
it
stars
great
headphones,
stay
in
place
in
your
ear
and
have
good
sound
comfortable
to
wear
battery
lasts
long
convenient
carrying
case
as
well
received
in
less
hrs
pretty
impressed
with
the
product
overall
was
worried
about
them
staying
in
my
ears
compared
to
other
air
pods
ve
used
was
mountain
biking
and
jumping
on
the
trampoline
all
day
with
them
on
never
came
loose
once
definitely
worth
it
for
the
price
this
is
the
first
pair
of
wireless
earbuds
that
ve
purchased
and
will
buy
another
pair
for
my
son
good
sound
and
easy
to
operate
use
these
for
whenever
working
on
project
requiring
physical
labor
or
at
the
gym
so
far,
very
pleased
most
of
the
time
only
one
earbud
actually
connects
then
have
to
delete
the
air
buds
from
my
bluetooth
and
readd
them
have
to
do
that
every
single
time
want
to
use
them
when
listening
to
them
sometimes
one
earbud
or
the
other
will
glitch
in
and
out
terrible
just
terrible
poor
battery,
bad
connection
less
than
year
later
they
refuse
to
connect
to
any
device
absolute
rip
off,
and
shouldn't
really
be
allowed
to
be
sold
pathetic
this
is
my
first
time
ever
using
wireless
headphones
amazing
while
working
out
and
using
the
sauna
was
supersized
on
how
well
it
gripped
my
ears
and
didn
fall
out
overall
very
satisfied
with
it
they
work
great
as
long
as
i'm
indoors
as
soon
as
step
outside
for
some
reason
though,
they
cut
in
and
out
constantly
to
the
point
where
just
have
to
stop
using
themthe
noise
cancellation
is
pretty
nice,
but
when
i'm
using
them
at
work
which
is
usually
very
noisy,
it
kind
of
defeats
the
purpose
when
have
to
take
them
out
every
hours
to
charge
them
ear
buds
last
long
time
as
well
as
the
charging
case
another
good
product
that
falls
short
of
the
goal
please
rework
the
products
low
end
and
you
will
have
winner
after
months
of
light
use,
the
right
ear
bud
no
longer
works
sound
quality
is
great,
material
texture
is
very
good,
easy
to
carry,
like
it
it's
worth
buying
as
soon
as
paired
these
to
my
phone
spotify
opened
and
ran
in
the
background
without
me
doing
anything
even
after
force
closing
the
app
it
restarted
anyway
these
earbuds
have
shady
software
in
them
do
not
buy
if
you
ask
but
for
some
reason,
be
aware
that
they
don't
work
unless
they
are
connected
to
each
other
and
your
phone
trying
to
use
just
one
doesn't
work
so
far
so
good
am
still
experimenting
with
the
ear
plugs
to
see
which
are
the
best
fit
for
my
ears
talked
to
the
manufacturer
and
they
sent
me
additional
sizes
very
happy
with
the
quality
of
these
ear
pieces
unfortunately
lost
the
left
one
while
gardening,
so
i'll
have
to
reorder,
amazing,
worth
the
money
just
make
sure
not
to
loose
em
these
are
amazing
thought
the
price
point
being
low
they
wouldbe
low
quality
but
they
are
my
favorite
and
very
user
friendly
have
s0
plus
and
paired
these
quick
and
painlessly
highly
suggest
these
earbuds
liked
that
the
earbuds
fit
in
my
ears
the
sound
quality
is
great
hate
the
music
they
play
in
the
gym
so
these
work
great
when
working
out
they
stay
in
without
me
having
to
constantly
adjusting
them
awesome
earbuds
with
great
design
and
comfort
also
it's
very
stylish
looking
earbuds,
used
it
almost
everyday
with
my
workout
at
gym
it's
must
buy
would
highly
recommended
every
time
make
phone
call
the
earbuds
get
disconnected
and
connected
over
and
over
again
not
letting
me
talk
on
the
phone
so
have
to
turn
them
off
all
the
time
so
they're
useless
to
use
them
for
phone
calls
these
headphones
are
simply
amazing
great
noise
cancellation
and
sound
quality
wonderful
during
call,
little
to
no
background
noise
on
the
receiving
end
fantastic
quality
for
the
price
0/0
would
recommend
when
place
them
in
the
charging
case
the
power
turns
on/off
by
itself
it
continuously
connects
to
my
phone
all
the
time
when
try
to
use
it
the
battery
is
always
low
the
sound
is
not
bad
but
could
have
more
bass
they
fit
great
and
don
move
when
working
out
or
running
have
been
running
less
than
min
these
days
and
had
any
issue
with
the
battery
lifethe
problem
is
that
the
right
earbud
keeps
disconnecting
don
know
why
but
after
minutes
it
gets
better
if
it
wasn
because
of
that,
was
happy
enough
with
them
bought
these
for
my
boyfriend
and
he
absolutely
loved
them
he
was
so
excited
to
find
out
they
also
double
as
portable
charger
for
his
phone
and
that
he
can
answer
phone
calls
with
just
tap
to
the
left
earbud
would
definitely
recommend
these
personally
loved
the
price
this
is
my
favorite
model
so
far,i
like
use
to
listen
music
at
gym
have
been
using
these
to
watch
amazon
shows
love
how
can
hear
lot
of
the
details
in
the
show
that
you
would
normally
miss
the
sound
quality
is
great
these
fit
perfectly
in
my
ears
also
moved
away
from
my
ipad
and
they
continued
to
work
had
the
first
set
replaced
because
one
side
did
not
work
the
replacement
would
not
work
gave
up
$0
down
the
drain
good
baterry
life
able
to
finish
my
shows
good
sound
quality
not
good
fit
for
my
ears,
keeps
on
falling
would
recommend
great
for
the
price
only
one
earbud
will
work
at
time,
lid
fell
off
the
case
soon
after
purchase,
sound
quality
and
volu,e
levels
are
terrible
these
are
the
first
wireless
headphones
that
bought
and
am
very
impressed
they
have
great
sound
quality
and
good
battery
life
really
like
being
able
to
charge
them
on
the
go
using
the
battery
in
the
case
overall,
am
very
happy
with
this
purchase
and
would
highly
recommend
them
was
very
happy
with
these
for
the
first
weeks
had
them
then
just
recently
the
right
one
became
significantly
less
loud
than
the
left
you
can
barely
hear
in
the
right
ear
in
full
volume
while
it
blasting
in
the
leftalso
make
loud
screeching
noise
every
once
in
whiledisappointed
these
only
lasted
weeks
pretty
decent
earbuds
for
the
price,
used
them
almost
every
day
for
gym/jogginghowever,
after
months
of
using
the
left
side
presents
lower
volume
couldn't
find
solution
yetthere
is
no
use
for
them
anymore
it
fits
pretty
well
in
my
ears
and
my
wife's
ears,
easy
to
set
up
and
has
great
sound
if
you're
lifting
weights
while
using
them,
they're
okay,
but
don't
recommend
them
for
jogging
or
running
it
is
easy
to
chargeand
light
to
carry
would
love
to
wear
it
when
am
free
to
listen
musicand
good
decisions
to
buy
it
these
headphones
are
extremely
comfortable
and
reliable,
easy
to
charge
and
convenient
controls
recommend
these
earbuds
for
anyone
in
the
gym
or
active
and
needs
great
sounding
pair
of
earbuds
mail
carrier
and
always
on
the
go
and
the
fact
that
they
are
waterproof
is
also
great
feature
these
headphones
are
amazing
ve
been
looking
for
good
paid
of
headphones
to
wear
to
the
gym
and
these
are
the
best
they
stay
perfectly
in
my
ears,
don
have
to
worry
about
carrying
my
phone
everywhere
with
me,
and
the
sound
quality
is
awesome
bought
second
pair
for
my
boyfriend
because
liked
them
so
much
if
you
are
purchasing
to
use
while
running
or
working
out,
these
are
for
you
snug
fit
that
stays
in
place
you
can
easily
focus
on
your
workout
and
tunes
without
distraction
from
poor
fitting
earbuds
these
earbuds
were
great
after
the
first
uses
and
then
the
right
earbud
just
went
dead
and
stop
working
the
left
earbud
still
charges
and
works
this
was
waste
of
money,
if
knew
they
would
only
last
for
about
month,
then
would
never
bought
them
the
price
is
very
good
and
relatively
low
was
hesitant,
too
but
when
received
them,
the
earpod
and
charge
box
works
great
the
directions
are
so
so
the
box
itself
is
remote
battery
charger
that
actually
keeps
the
ear
plugs
charged
when
they
are
in
it
automatically
sounds
good
and
battery
lasts
0+
hours
this
is
very
nice
product
for
the
money,
and
recommend
at
0st
loved
these
because
they
stayed
in
my
ears
really
well
and
thought
they
were
loud
enough
after
months,
they
re
too
quiet
to
wear
to
the
gym
super
bummed
also
you
cannot
talk
to
people
on
the
phone,
music
only
wonderful
and
amazing
strong
reliable
connection
and
good
sound
quality
the
case
provides
extra
power
for
my
phone
bought
two
of
them
for
me
and
my
wife
and
they
have
not
disappointed
us
my
wife
has
iphone
and
have
android
and
the
earbuds
work
fine
with
both
great
choice
absolutely
loved
these
headphones
the
sound
quality
is
great,
the
bass
is
incredibly
good,
and
the
battery
life
exceeded
expectations
the
charging
case
is
also
huge
benefit
it
charges
your
phone
as
well
as
the
headphones
wirelessly
would
recommend
this
product
actually
loved
the
headphones
while
they
worked
very
much
worth
the
money
jus
rupert
because
it
says
they
are
water
resistant,
and
ran
through
the
rain
one
day
and
they
stopped
working
very
disappointed
they
stopped
working
so
easily
purchased
these
after
my
kids
went
on
and
on
how
great
these
wireless
earbuds
are
thought
the
style
was
attractive
and
they
fit
in
my
ears
perfect,
not
uncomfortable
at
all
even
the
sound
quality
was
fabulous
they
were
very
low
cost
and
affordable
would
buy
again
love
them
tons
wasted
my
money
couldn't
even
try
them
on
it
says
they
were
used
but
didn't
expect
they
came
all
dirty
on
the
inside
of
the
ear
piece
had
them
for
days
now
and
the
left
ear
piece
is
slowly
getting
quieter
the
pairing
is
but
of
hassle
but
otherwise
there's
alot
to
love
about
these
for
the
price
they're
waterproof,
sound
canceling,
and
decently
comfortable
good
for
the
money
but
definitely
could
be
better
this
is
good
earbuds
feel
comfortable
when
wear
it
the
sound
from
it
is
clear
and
good
it
can
play
long
time
without
charging
it
is
very
easy
to
use,
just
wear
it
on
you
ears
and
then
put
back
to
the
case
this
is
conveniet
when
want
to
listen
to
music
during
sports
or
make
phone
call
great
producta
little
too
sensitive
with
touch
controlhowever,
comfortable
to
wear
and
great
soundshave
not
attempted
on
waterproof
function
very
comfortable
ear
piece
long
battery
life
and
very
easy
to
use
the
battery
does
not
last
very
long
at
all,
maybe
an
hour
and
half
after
full
charge
sound
isnt
good,
didnt
fit
my
ear
wellnot
good
headphoneswaterproof
is
the
best
feature
es
muy
grande
como
para
andar
en
el
bolsillo
all
around
pretty
great,
but
the
right
earbud
keeps
cutting
out
nothing
more
frustrating
than
going
for
new
personal
best
on
deadlift
and
then
you
automatically
only
hear
half
of
death
will
reign
by
impending
doom
worst
money
ve
ever
spent
easy
to
pair
device
using
bluetooth,
but
that
about
itbattery
life
is
about
minutesonce
in
ear,
hard
to
operate
other
than
pause/play
by
the
time
good
song
begins,
need
to
recharge
really
frustrated
with
them
the
sound
is
pretty
good
but
if
there
is
noise
in
your
background
they
do
not
cancel
it
out
very
well
the
battery
life
is
very
good
and
charging
container
holds
charge
for
days
with
moderate
use
ear
buds
can
be
very
uncomfortable
and
painful
if
worn
for
extended
periods
of
time
they
hurt
my
ears
after
about
to
minutes
of
continuous
wear
love
these
ear
buds
sturdy,
excellent
quality,
comfortable,
and
easy
to
use
their
customer
service
is
excellent
and
quick
to
respond
thanks
for
making
such
good
product
my
son
loves
these
said
they
are
very
much
worth
the
money
just
received
my
new
ear
buds
and
in
lovethe
fit
is
perfect
and
the
sound
is
excellenti
looking
forward
to
many
quality
moments
original
one
had
absolutely
pathetic
sound
quality
could
barely
hear
anything
seller
sent
another
one
which
works
great
terrible
on
my
second
set
of
headphones
and
one
of
the
ear
buds
is
not
working
same
issue
as
the
first
set
and
now
it
too
late
to
get
an
exchange
or
refund
if
my
phone
is
in
my
pocket,
the
signal
cuts
in
and
out
only
works
if
hold
the
phone
few
inches
from
the
ear
piece
for
the
price
these
are
great
use
them
daily,
usually
with
only
one
bud
in,
for
about
hours
day
only
have
to
recharge
them
once
throughout
the
day
and
they
charge
pretty
quick
sound
is
decent
enough
they
fit
snug
in
my
ear,
sweat
lot
and
they
hold
up
these
are
fairly
decent
the
charging
case
is
nice
benefit
the
headphones
sound
crisp
and
clear
with
good
amount
of
base
but
not
base
intensive
they're
were
fairly
easy
to
connect
and
they
don't
sound
cheap
love
these
but
sometimes
when
use
only
one
of
the
headphones,
the
bluetooth
seems
to
have
difficulty
small
cutting
in/out
of
sound
but
overall
love
the
sound
quality
and
and
the
battery
lasts
me
most
of
the
week
this
is
great
product
i'm
normally
using
my
headphones
with
the
cords
so
switching
was
not
easy
they
came
package
very
neat
and
lightweight
fits
comfortable
in
my
ears,
the
calls
were
heard
very
clear
enjoyed
listening
to
my
music
with
no
background
noise
interrupting
great
product
these
headphones
were
definitely
one
of
my
better
purchases
bought
them
for
work/gym,
and
usually
keep
one
earphone
in
til
it
dies
about
hours,
then
swap
it
out
for
the
other
the
sound
quality
is
great,
nice
bass
easy
to
connect,
solid
bluetooth
range
no
complaints
at
all
absolutely
recommend
over
those
whack
airpods
these
things
are
pretty
rad
they
last
roughly
hours
on
one
charge
then
it
only
takes
it
about
hour
to
recharge
sound
is
good,
volume
is
good
happy
that
can
listen
to
my
music
every
where
without
wires
holding
me
back
sound
is
very
good,
not
the
best
but
for
the
price
it
does
the
job
and
then
some
fit
is
good,
at
times
actually
forget
they're
there
and
in
contrast
with
their
size,
that's
saying
something
appreciate
the
case/charger
and
its
capabilities,
overall
awesome
piece
to
cop,
thumbs
up
from
me
these
earbuds
were
designed
with
convenience
in
mind
used
these
at
the
gym
and
it's
really
nice
not
to
have
cable
hanging
from
your
neck
plus
the
stick
with
enough
pressure
that
doesn't
hurt
your
ears
recommend
love
these
little
buds
easy
paring
long
battery
life
ordered
this
for
my
husband
for
christmas
and
he
is
in
love
with
them
he
says
that
it
was
easy
to
connect
to
his
phone
and
simple
to
use
definitely
recommend
these
if
you
are
looking
for
some
nice
bluetooth
headphones
cheaper
than
the
competition
and
the
sound
quality
is
also
slightly
below
but
they
have
an
amazing
customer
support
if
any
issues
bought
these
for
my
son
who
is
constantly
losing
or
breaking
wireless
earbuds
he
loves
these
and
keeps
the
case
in
his
pocket
at
all
times
months
later
he
is
complaining
that
the
battery
charge
on
the
case
isn
what
it
used
to
be
very
worth
earphones
fancy
look,
easy
using,
and
the
charger
is
useful
love
these
headphones
it's
super
hard
for
me
to
find
pair
that
has
great
sound
quality
they
fit
properly
in
my
ears,
and
they
don't
fall
out
while
i'm
running
on
the
treadmill
at
the
gym
also
the
battery
lasts
longer
than
thought
it
would

going
to
buy
another
pair

my
wife
great
product

impressed
with
the
product

excellent
and
definitely
cancels
out
any
sound
around
you

my
purchase

use
them
when
ride
my
motorcycle
bought
these
off
of
recommendation
from
friend
in
the
beginning
they
were
great
and
also
recommended
them
to
several
other
friends
who
also
purchased
them
couple
weeks
ago
the
right
bud
sound
faded
to
almost
nonexistent
and
the
left
followed
about
week
later
they
are
now
totally
useless
now
i'm
feeling
sorry
that
recommended
them
so
highly
to
my
friends
this
product
is
perfect
it
does
exactly
what
need
it
too
bought
them
for
the
gym
they
dont
fall
out,
the
definitly
reduce
the
noise
hear,
and
the
battery
us
amazing
try
many
earbuds,
this
one
is
not
too
big,
just
fit
my
ears
nice
sounds
and
battery
life
recommend
use
them
every
day
at
work,
they
are
very
comfortable
and
easy
to
use
the
charging
station
fits
in
my
pocket
so
can
take
them
out
and
store
them
quickly
and
easily
love
that
they
are
always
charging
when
am
not
wearing
them
the
sound
is
great
love,
love,
love
them
would
definitely
recommend
them
to
anyone
no
complaints
so
far
love
the
charging
case
make
sure
you
put
on
correct
rubber
ear
piece
to
hold
securely
in
ear
simple
to
use
and
nice
size
profile
fits
in
ears
good
and
comes
with
lots
of
extra
ear
pieces
for
custom
fit
sound
could
be
better
but
did
notice
that
bass
amount
is
affected
by
how
you
have
them
in
your
ear
wow
these
are
finally
what
was
looking
for
walk/jog
for
excercise
and
have
been
searching
for
the
right
ones
especially
like
the
case
and
the
way
they
charge
thru
the
case
the
fit
and
sound
quality
are
great
the
battery
usually
lasts
me
about
hours
which
is
the
main
down
side
because
used
them
at
work
so
have
to
charge
them
every
hours
or
so
but
they
work
great
sound
quality
is
okay
probably
not
the
best
but
great
for
everyday
use
connecting
to
my
devices
was
super
easy,
they
are
comfortable
and
put
out
lot
of
sound
bought
these
earbuds,
hoping
to
use
them
while
commuting
and
jogging
they
failed
even
at
first
as
couldnt
stay
in
my
ear,
and
when
put
them
deeper
which
is
hurt,
they
would
fall
off
in
minutes
anywaysyesterday
almost
lost
it
in
subwaynot
to
mention
the
sound
is
not
the
best,
but
ok
for
earbudsvery
disappointed
with
the
purchase
my
son
uses
it
to
listen
to
music
awesome
headphones
better
than
expected
be
sure
to
read
directions
before
use
not
all
that
great
for
talking
on
the
phone
but
other
than
that
they
are
awesome
really
like
these
earbuds,
they
do
everything
need
them
to
do
in
some
cases
even
more
the
sound
quality
is
very
clear
and
enjoyable
to
listen
the
overall
style
of
the
earbuds
look
good
in
the
ears
have
no
complains
and
suggest
them
if
you
are
looking
to
buy
bluetooth
earbuds
really
liked
these
when
got
them
very
comfy,
good
battery
life,
had
some
connection
problems,
but
use
an
elliptical
to
work
out,
so
it
wasn't
big
deal
then
at
about
months
in,
they
stopped
charging
and
connecting
properly
only
one
side
would
connect
seems
to
be
common
issue
with
wireless
earbuds
great
for
watching
or
listening
to
something
on
your
phone
but
not
good
enough
quality
for
talking,
hard
for
the
other
person
to
hear/understand
you
can
slip
out
as
well
and
you
have
to
be
careful
how
you
touch
the
ear
buds
once
in
sold
my
air
pods
because
they
don
fit
in
my
ears
and
these
were
the
perfect
transition
multiple
tips
you
can
switch
for
different
ear
sizes
is
so
helpful
the
sound
quality
is
very
comparable
to
the
pods
as
well,
just
excellent
for
the
price
you
can
find
better
wireless
headphones
don't
buy
these
headphones
they
would
turn
on
by
themselves
while
still
in
the
case
and
then
the
case
and
headphones
broke
after
months
of
use
not
recommended,
i've
had
several
pairs
of
wireless
earbuds
and
these
are
the
worst
i've
owned
really
like
this
product
the
recharging
case
is
cool
and
like
how
the
earbuds
are
magnetically
attached
so
you
know
it
connected
overall
very
pleased
my
son
said
they
are
great,
and
just
what
he
needed
these
don
fit
my
ears
right
plus
if
you
touched
them
incorrectly
they
shut
off
the
keep
falling
out
of
my
ears
not
as
loud
as
hoped
so
far
they
are
working
great
great
noise
quality
and
fit
well
in
my
ears
bought
these
earbuds
months
ago
they
had
light
usage,
only
being
used
times
per
week
when
worked
out
initially
they
worked
great,
good
sound,
easy
to
use
then
weeks
ago
the
right
earbud
stopped
working
completely
tried
everything
it
said
in
the
user
manual
and
online
to
do
nothing
worked
now
have
very
expensive
single
earbud
workmanship
and
qualitybon
this
product
is
poor
these
earbuds
are
great
for
long
trips
and
everyday
use
they
are
durable
and
water
resistant
which
is
nice
because
my
last
earbuds
broke
from
water
the
two
downsides
are
that
they
don
cancel
noise
very
well
and
some
bass
is
filtered
out
tried
all
the
different
tips
but
could
not
get
good
isolation
of
outside
noise
product
seems
to
be
of
good
quality
and
the
sound
is
adequate
it
wont
work
when
riding
motorcycle
the
people
on
the
other
end
of
the
phone
could
not
understand
what
was
saying
they
kept
saying
that
sounded
muffled
this
was
significant
disappointment
as
need
to
communicate
for
business
purposes
and
certainly
can't
settle
for
this
type
of
quality
don't
get
this
product
after
months
of
use
very
lite
use
at
that
the
right
ear
bud
has
stopped
working
it
still
connects
through
bluetooth
but
no
sound
comes
out
they
were
great
when
they
did
work,
but
for
the
cost
these
absolutely
should
be
still
functioning
at
months
wouldn't
waste
your
time
by
getting
these
the
sound
quality
is
sufficient,had
no
problems
syncing
up
with
my
s0
my
son
thinks
it's
perfectly
ok
to
listen
music
or
watch
movies
use
them
at
the
gym
and
they
work
great
so
far
was
hesitant
to
buy
these
because
the
price
point
is
low
for
this
type
of
product,
but
am
glad
to
buy
these
and
recommend
earphones
because
great
quality,
easy
pairing,
and
they
work
independently
and
together
quite
well
battery
lasts
0+
hours
omg
sound
and
bass
amazing
easy
to
pair
cant
believe
this
earphone
so
good
love
the
prices
and
this
product
these
earbuds
were
pretty
good
when
they
worked
properly
but
that
was
short
lived
the
charging
case
will
no
longer
charge
the
left
earbud
the
earbud
only
blinks
on
briefly
before
shutting
off
stay
away
from
this
product
unless
you
like
using
only
one
earbud
my
son
likes
them
very
non
reliable
disconnect
mid
conversation
or
after
few
minuets
of
silence
don't
waste
your
money
on
this
garbage
and
i'm
saying
garbage
to
keep
from
cussing
would've
thrown
them
out
on
the
interstate
but
didn't
want
to
get
ticketed
for
littering
difficult
to
hear
during
phone
conversation
worked
great
for
two
weeks,
then
volume
seemed
to
cut
in
half
while
using
for
phone
calls,
could
not
be
heard,
nor
could
hear
who
was
speaking
with
support
gave
me
instructions
to
reset
this
helped
for
another
week
or
so,
then
back
to
the
same
sub
quality
volume
resetting
earphones
no
longer
help
resolve
the
problem,
and
the
return
window
has
closed
would
not
recommend
other
than
the
bluetooth
being
too
grabby
probably
great
thing
for
people
that
don
know
what
they
re
doing
and
the
case
been
little
tricky
to
open
need
better
nails
great
device,
especially
for
the
price
it
was
very
easy
to
set
up
and
use
charged
very
quick
they
last
long
time
great
ear
pods
highly
recommend
honestly
quite
amazed
with
these
headphones
from
the
amazing
value
of
the
price,
to
the
actual
quality
they
re
incredibly
comfortable
and
sit
snug
in
my
ear
they
were
very
easy
to
set
up,
and
the
sound
is
the
best
ve
experienced
left
earbud
did
not
work
correctly
right
out
of
the
box
took
about
minutes
of
troubleshooting
to
get
them
to
work
at
all
after
charging
and
manual
reset
flimsy
silicon
ear
tips
did
not
seal
at
all
worst
base
performance
of
half
dozen
earbuds
ve
tried
not
happy
at
all
and
will
return
works
very
well
the
sound
is
very
good
bought

now
0earbud
will
not
charge
waste
of
bucks
my
first
pair
worked
great
for
about
weeks
then
only
the
right
channel
then
neither
side
the
company
replaced
them
about
weeks
ago
and
this
pair
is
working
well
it
was
little
tricky
to
get
the
paired
to
each
other
but
once
connected
they
work
great
connects
with
my
ipad
every
time
comfortable
and
easy
to
wear
with
nice,
snug
fit
good
sound
quality
nice
little

that
doubles
as
phone

you
can't
beat
the
$0

tag
best

good
product
good

it's
perfect
bluetooth
wireless
headphones
recommend
in
this
headphone
is
the
great
and
the
good
price
good
battery
charging
twice
in
charge
my
phone
twice
great
earbuds
just
using
them
all
dayfeels
good
in
the
ear,
the
material
feels
like
nice
qualityi
very
satisfied
also
with
the
price
they're
fine,
if
you
want
them
for
running,
you'll
have
to
go
get
those
little
ear
inserts
that
go
on
along
with
the
rubber
ear
tips
to
keep
it
anchored
in
your
ear
but
then
it
won't
fit
the
charging
case
have
pair
one
for
me
and
one
for
my
wife
we
both
love
them
had
small
issue
with
one
pair
and
the
customer
service
dept
promptly
took
care
of
it
great
product
with
great
customer
service
to
back
it
up
excellent
product
for
such
great
price,
and
their
customer
service
is
top
notch
had
an
issue
with
my
initial
pair,
so
reached
out
to
their
support
team
and
they
sent
me
new
set
without
any
trouble
at
all
will
absolutely
recommend
to
others
already
have
for
some
of
my
coworkers
it
can
receive
the
atmosphere
is
far
away,
the
sound
quality
is
clear
and
smooth
without
murmur
it's
easy
to
carry
very
well
presented
the
micro
works
perfect
and
the
quality
sound
is
all
wright
ir
you
bought
them
to
attend
calls
would
not
recommend
them
to
hear
músic
this
product
came
fast
and
furious
my
teenage
daughter
claimed
them
right
away
and
stated
that
they
are
the
best
she
ever
used
these
are
very
good
quality
ear
buds
packaging
is
great
pairing
with
my
phone
and
ipad
was
super
easy
charging
is
super
easy
not
sure
about
the
battery
life
yet
because
just
received
them
few
days
ago
but
the
sound
quality
is
excellent
as
well
great
product
just
as
described
this
an
updated
review
at
first
thought
the
sound
was
terrible
and
no
bass
but
would
like
to
say
you
can
beat
these
for
the
money
they
do
have
great
sound
and
bass
you
just
need
to
make
sure
you
have
the
correct
ear
tips
it
makes
all
the
difference
didn't
like
the
fit
or
the
capacitive
touch
operation
bought
another
brand
by
another
manufacturer
within
week
kept
these
for
work,
but
expect
to
throw
them
out,
because
the
headphones
are
uncomfortable
they
work
well
for
me
when
do
spin
or
free
weights
no
problems
i'm
using
the
wireless
earplugs
for
music
and
making
calls
it
really
convenient
and
the
quality
is
very
good
like
it
very
much
these
earbuds
arrived
quickly
and
came
charged
they
even
have
their
own
charging
box
unfortunately,
the
small
part
that
goes
inside
the
ear
bothered
my
eardrum
and
the
larger
part
that
sits
in
the
outer
ear
was
too
bulky
they
gave
me
headache
after
few
minutes
while
wanted
to
love
them,
can't
recommend
them
man
this
product
it
amazing
the
sound
quality,
the
way
it
looks
and
how
it
fits
your
ear
music
sounds
perfect
the
instructions
are
alright,
you
can
read
it
and
understand
it
the
price
it
worthy
for
what
going
to
get
can
say
more,
this
thing
it
really
good
overall
this
product
is
good
and
at
good
price
very
easy
to
install
and
very
easy
and
convenient
to
usethe
only
thing
that
bothers
me
is
that
on
some
phone
calls
the
earphone
disconnected
from
time
to
time
for
seconds,
which
is
really
problematic
on
phone
calls
great
battery,
great
sound,
great
stability
love
that
it's
semicompact
and
not
to
large
for
it
having
battery
capacity
for
recharge
the
sound
quality
is
just
okay
and
from
time
to
time
find
the
earbuds
don't
play
at
the
same
volumefurther,
the
filters
on
each
of
them
are
super
flimsy
and
even
had
one
fall
offoverall,
this
product
is
just
fine
but
you
can't
beat
the
price
use
this
product
while
in
the
gym
doing
body
building
style
workouts
and
cardio
like
that
they
don't
fall
out
while
running
bought
set
for
gift,
and
after
testing
them
out
ordered
myself
set
great
price
for
bluetooth
headset
syncing
the
first
time
was
no
issue
sometimes
have
an
issue
with
them
connecting
when
first
take
them
out
of
the
case
but
find
if
they
don
correct
themselves
right
away,
can
just
put
them
back
in
the
case
and
take
them
out
again
which
solves
the
problem
the
sound
just
got
these
in
today
and
was
excited
to
test
them
out
they
paired
very
easily,
and
so
far
i'm
impressed
the
sound
quality
is
good
but
not
great,
but
keep
in
mind,
the
price
so
far
no
cutting
out
as
other
brands
do
good
buy
these
are
the
best
bluetooth
headphones
ever
bought
these
are
my
second
pair
the
others
still
work
fine
listen
to
audio
books
all
day
and
don't
have
to
switch
out
to
another
pair
at
the
end
of
the
day
thought
would
save
money
on
this
highly
rated
product
tried
them
for
number
of
days
paired
with
my
iphone
and
discovered
was
wrong
the
sound
i#
tinny,
with
virtually
no
base
they
fell
out
of
my
ears
during
workouts
the
battery
life
was
short
reverted
to
apple
airpods
which
am
now
convinced
is
worth
the
money
so
far
so
good
the
earbuds
paired
up
with
my
iphone
instantly
and
are
easy
to
charge
in
their
case
the
sound
quality
is
great
ve
only
used
them
few
times
but
happy
with
them
so
far
and
there
is
info
in
the
packaging
about
contacting
their
customer
service
if
any
problems
arise
ordered
this
product
and
unfortunately,
the
left
earbud
didn't
work
then
got
replacement
set
and
the
right
earbud
didn't
work
in
the
days
that
had
either
earbud,
while
on
the
phone,
it
started
having
solid
sound
of
static
both
sets
failed
me
this
product
was
easy
to
set
up
and
pair
no
problems
gave
the
noise
cancellation
only
stars
because,
when
using
these,
was
walking
and
needed
to
hear
any
traffic
otherwise
they
are
easy
to
use
and
sound
is
very
good
unclear
and
talking
very
bad
no
one
can
hear
when
you
talk
great
item
works
great
battery
last
about
four
hours
but
the
recharging
case
last
like
days
without
needing
to
recharge
they
fit
little
big
on
the
ears
wish
they
were
tad
smaller
first
pair
of
wireless
headphones
and
so
far
love
them
the
company
has
been
great
too,
saw
the
price
drop
the
day
after
ordering
them
so
messaged
the
company
and
the
next
day
they
already
processed
the
refund
of
the
difference
they
sound
great
they
also
fit
well
and
are
very
comfortable
love
the
case
they
come
within
all
am
very
satisfied
with
my
purchase
fast
delivery
very
easy
to
use
and
the
sound
quality
is
actually
quite
good
compare
with
the
a**
one
awesome
product
for
the
price
my
roommate
recommended
me
on
buying
this
earbuds
and
they
are
better
than
expected
not
very
loud
weak
sound
for
the
price
do
not
recommend
so
bought
these
headphone
back
in
march
and
its
now
december
and
one
of
them
is
starting
to
go
out
the
sound
is
muffled
in
one,
the
battery
life
is
great
but
wish
it
would
of
lasted
at
least
full
year
just
tried
these
new
earbuds
the
reviews
are
right
they
are
great
great
sound,
almost
cancels
out
all
noise,
lightweight,
and
fit
in
my
ears
perfectly
female,
and
best
of
all
they
don't
fall
out
when
run
they
are
weather
resistant/sweat
resistance,
have
been
using
them
for
running
and
did
not
had
any
issues
with
them
falling
out
of
the
ear
headset
case
have
big
battery
capacity
so
you
don't
have
to
charge
it
everyday
after
couple
weeks
it
started
losing
bluetooth
connection
randomly
cuts
in
and
out
too
sensitive
kept
kept
hanging
up
calls
couldn't
even
get
the
things
to
turn
on
tried
resetting,
manually
doing
it
nothing
works
instructions
are
very
unclear
since
it
is
in
terrible
broken
english
on
top
of
that
there
is
no
phone
number
to
contact
any
support
only
an
email
or
going
through
facebook
in
that's
astoundingly
stupid
avoid
this
piece
of
crap
at
all
costs
they
worked
wonders
during
testing
for
canceling
the
sound
out
from
other
students
never
had
pair
of
wireless
headphones
before,
but
this
seems
to
be
great
paired
easily,
fits
comfortably,
and
lasts
long
good
battery
life
good
product
has
magnet
inside
case
when
charging,
so
easy
to
place
them
easy
to
pair
only
downside
zero
base
terrific
purchase
this
headset
is
the
best
sound
quality
i've
ever
used
it
works
well
it
lasts
for
long
time
it's
very
satisfying
bought
these
as
gift
for
my
boyfriend
they
work
great
the
only
bad
thing
would
say
is
the
charger
that
came
with
it
had
wires
coming
out
of
it
picture
is
attached
to
show
what
i'm
talking
about
other
than
that
they
are
great
headphones
excellent
soundgood
battery
life
also
would
buy
again
love
these
great
sound
came
with
it's
own
drawstring
bag,
extra
tips,
etc
bery
well
constructed
and
perfect
for
the
shower
since
they
are
waterproof
love
the
style
and
comfort
of
the
ear
pieces
the
only
downside,
they
don
stay
charged
for
long
have
an
iphone
and
use
them
to
listen
to
music/movies
while
working
they
last
for
about
hours
before
have
to
put
them
back
in
the
case
to
charge
they
don
work
period
don
buy
in
what
world
would
someone
want
to
re
sync
your
ear
buds
every
time
you
use
them
and
the
syncing
them
is
overly
complicated
on
top
of
that
waste
of
money
this
product
stopped
working
immediately
after
my
return
deadline
was
expired
was
only
able
to
use
this
product
for
less
than
months
very
disappointed
good
affordable
option
for
bluetooth
earbuds
sound
is
good
and
the
battery
lasts
forever
use
them
for
about
hours
day
at
work
and
the
battery
pack
case
lasted
about
month
on
full
charge
at
that
level
of
usage
great
head
phones
but
last
around
hours
max
love
the
overall
fit
of
my
twsx0
enjoy
how
they
stay
snuggly
fit
in
my
ears
while
workout
and
enjoy
how
the
noise
cancelling
feature
drowns
out
the
music
from
the
gym
that
do
not
like
liked
the
earbuds
so
well,
decided
to
purchase
second
pair
while
using
one
pair
the
other
is
charging
in
its
own
casei
can
get
several
charges
before
have
to
recharge
the
case
very
nice
product
like
the
customer
service
love
these
sound
amazing
battery
life
amazing
comfort
amazing
the
sound
has
zero
depth
to
it,
sounds
empty
and
weak
buds
didn
pair
together
the
first
few
times
attempted
to
use
them
these
are
weak
and
cheap,
go
for
something
else
very
good
bluetooth
with
clear
sound
and
connection
long
lasting
battery
with
charging
case
never
need
to
worry
it
would
out
of
power
highly
recommended
have
always
hated
earbuds
because
they
hurt
my
ears
but
these
are
awesome
don
even
know
they
are
there
they
are
so
comfortable
the
sound
is
amazing
and
the
setup
was
so
easy
really
like
that
you
just
have
to
touch
the
earbud
to
get
it
to
pause
will
be
buying
more
of
these
for
my
boys
birthdays
like
to
listen
to
sound
machine
app
while
reading
books
these
do
cut
out
lot
also,
the
case
is
kinda
bulky
great
headphones
no
issues
sound
great
have
had
these
earbuds
for
several
weeks
and
have
not
been
able
to
use
them
half
the
time
they
won't
turn
on
and
when
they
do
they
never
have
more
than
0%
battery
life
even
though
they
have
been
on
the
charger
for
hours
don't
waste
your
money
these
are
great
for
music
but
horrible
for
talking
on
the
phone
with
kind
of
big
too
for
my
ears
so
excited
to
receive
these
headphones
as
am
mom
of
young
children,
and
really
need
to
keep
my
hands
free
was
able
to
get
so
much
house
work
accomplished
with
these
the
sound
quality
was
amazing
and
super
comfortable
these
earbuds
are
maybe
worth
0$
max
not
worth
this
money
for
the
quality
of
the
sound
+
it
loses
connectivity
frequantly
and
one
earbud
sometimes
has
lower
sound
or
no
sound
at
all
do
not
recommend
this
product
please
dont
waste
your
money
sound
very
clearly
,battery
us
much
longer
,fit
to
my
ears
this
earbuds
is
pretty
qualify
of
sounds
is
good,the
songs
are
clear
do
like
the
box,even
is
little
bigit
really
good
one
for
working
out
the
sound
is
actually
really
good,
yeah
it
really
doesn't
have
that
bass
you
are
used
to
in
the
airpods,
however,
the
sound
quality
is
very
good
the
batteries
for
the
case
are
borderline
infinite,
super
easy
to
set
up
and
they
are
ultra
comfortable
received
one
pair,
that
lasted
about
weeks
before
one
of
the
earbuds
stopped
connecting
to
the
case,
which
prevented
them
from
charging
and
would
sync
to
my
phone
randomly
they
thankfully
sent
me
another
pair,
which
lasted
me
few
months
before
they
had
the
same
problem
they're
decent
headphones
when
they're
new,
but
really
aren't
made
to
last
not
loud
these
things
have
very
short
battery
life
and
they
constantly
disconnect
from
my
phone
this
is
my
first
wireless
ear
bud
sound
quality
is
good
it
has
amazon
choice
tag,
gain
confidence
case
has
highest
battery
charging
support
for
two
or
three
days
the
bluetooth
earbuds
are
ok,
but
will
not
buy
them
again
wanted
these
because
of
noise
cancellation,
due
to
me
driving
lot
it
picks
up
every
sound,
even
with
the
windows
rolled
up
the
setup
instructions
were
clear
and
they
worked
right
away
great
product
sound
quality
is
good
battery
life
is
great
arrived
in
days
like
the
way
it
fit
in
my
ear
the
sound
quality
is
very
good
battery
life
is
hrs
talk
time
overall
is
very
good
product
will
definitely
recommend
this
product
very
fast
on
response
when
had
issue
very
helpful
on
the
fix
use
these
for
music
and
tv
on
my
ipad
these
are
great
headphones
for
the
price
the
battery
pack
lasted
me
for
about
two
weeks
right
out
of
the
box,
which
was
pleasant
surprise
and
the
sound
is
excellent
i'd
like
little
more
noise
canceling,
but
it's
actually
pretty
darn
good
for
under
$0
very
happy
with
these
new
headphones
that
my
husband
got
me
battery
life
is
great
can
wear
them
where
workout
and
they
don't
fall
out
at
all
don't
have
to
deal
with
cord
getting
in
my
way
anymore
or
losing
pieces
that
easily
fall
off
very
happy
with
this
purchase
love
that
these
have
portable
charging
case
and
pair
so
easily
every
time
use
them
they
are
the
perfect
size,
have
long
lasting
battery,
and
fit
my
ears
perfectly
the
left
side
hasn
been
working
and
it
so
low
it
might
as
well
be
broken
have
tried
looking
for
customer
service
to
speak
about
this
issue
and
see
if
there
something
the
company
can
do
about
it
but
haven
found
anything
an
auto
technician
and
like
music
now
can
listen
to
what
like
instead
of
what
the
shop
decides
to
play
instructions
little
difficult
but
managed
great
bang
for
the
buck
super
fast
delivery,
excellent
product
so
far
they
fit
perfectly
in
my
ears
and
the
sound
is
crystal
clear
excited
to
go
running
with
these
knowing
that
they
won
fall
out
it
would
work
great
if
it
didn't
keep
cutting
out
every
time
you
move
if
like
to
sit
still
listen
to
music
this
is
for
you
if
you
like
to
move
around
and
exercise
with
your
music
this
isn't
for
you
every
time
when
just
walk
it
cuts
out
every
few
seconds
not
worthh
the
moneyyyyyyy
dont
buy
bought
these
for
my
husband
for
while
he
is
at
work
he
loves
them
he
wears
one
at
time
usually
and
said
it
is
perfect
for
listening
to
music
while
working
and
is
also
able
to
answer
his
work
calls
this
is
great
product
and
for
that
price,
you
can't
beat
it
using
primarily
for
music,
but
works
good
for
phone
calls
too
was
disappointed
in
the
range
these
ear
buds
provide
have
another
pair
of
wireless
headphones
which
where
only
$0
that
have
much
better
range
i've
only
used
them
three
times
and
they
are
already
breaking
at
the
seams
so
plan
to
return
them
had
issues
with
the
0st
pair,
but
they
promptly
sent
me
replacement
which
is
working
great
they
fit
nicely,
charge
well
and
sound
is
excellent
like
the
profile
too
which
hides
them
vs
the
airpods
which
stick
out
and
look
ugly
and
pretentious
not
for
all
ear
types,
but
they
fit
well
for
me
these
earbuds
are
great,
they
even
come
with
charging
bank
for
your
phone
they
paired
great
with
my
google
pixel
xl,
and
sound
quality
is
great
highly
recommend
these
for
the
price,
would
make
great
gift
really
like
the
size
of
these
earbuds
they
fit
well
and
don't
easily
fall
out
be
sure
to
read
the
instructions
so
you
know
how
to
operate
the
volume
controls
the
earbuds
volume
is
independent
from
connected
devises
use
these
at
work,
very
noisy
environment,
but
can
hear
them
and
can
only
wear
one
ear
bud
at
time
love
that
never
have
to
think
about
charging
them
also
the
fit
takes
little
getting
used
to
but
once
you
have
it
down
your
golden
so
far
so
good
no
complaints
yet
the
headphone
are
working
great,
easy
to
use
if
it
changes
i'll
update
my
review
excellent
sound
easy
to
use
don't
know
if
they
will
stay
in
my
ears
while
running
because
haven't
been
able
to
run
want
wireless
headphone
for
long
time
this
one
is
perfect
for
me
it
has
high
quality
and
can
work
for
long
time
easy
to
connect
no
funcionan
correctamente
como
esperaba,
surgen
detalles
cuando
los
uso,
les
di
suficiente
tiempo
para
que
funcionarán
no
me
convencieron
correctamente
no
los
devolví
por
darle
la
oportunidad
they
sound
great
and
connect
to
my
phone
and
my
laptop
work
great
for
running
and
working
out
touchpad
on
the
side
of
the
headphones
works
great
for
pausing/playing
music,
answering
calls,
and
getting
hold
of
siri
great
product
this
was
my
second
pair
of
bluetooth
headphones
at
first
they
worked
fine
and
paired
very
well,
however
every
time
went
near
tv
the
signal
appeared
to
interfere
with
the
headphones
and
the
sound
constantly
cut
in
and
out
this
became
unbearable
and
realized
could
not
use
them
anymore,
which
was
shame
because
otherwise
they
seemed
to
work
well
mic
seems
to
have
some
issue
touch
control
is
too
sensitive,
got
disconnected
from
the
call
while
adjusting
the
bud
like
the
case
and
charging
bank
though
this
product
was
not
good
at
all
after
weeks
the
sound
got
lower
and
lower
could
not
hear
the
music
barely
at
all
would
not
waste
my
money
for
an
extra
$0
you
can
get
name
brand
work
great
and
very
durable
the
battery
life
is
proven
to
be
excellent
from
practical
perspective,
the
case
is
designed
to
not
only
be
protective
mode
of
transport
for
your
earbuds
but
also
provides
an
excellent
way
to
do
quick
recharge
on
the
go
the
design
is
simple
and
easy
to
use
love
these
earbuds
they
fit
nicely
in
the
ears,
great
sound
quality,
and
long
charge
love
the
portable
charging
case
they
come
with
these
are
so
easy
to
use
and
convenient
my
only
issue
with
these
is
that
can't
listen
to
just
the
right
earbud
it
will
only
work
if
the
left
is
being
used
as
well
at
my
job
can
only
have
one
earbud
in
so
always
use
the
left
they
are
very
hardy
the
quality
of
these
wireless
earbuds
are
amazingi
can
work
out
with
these
headphones
and
they
fit
snug
in
my
ears
with
out
falling
or
slippingi

the
reviews

half
the
price

0x
better
highly

loud
and
works
great
they

very
comfortable
the

charge
your

think
these
are
great
choice
for
nice
pair
or
wireless
headphones
i've
only
got
this
for
couple
of
days
and
already
the
left/right
earbud
pairing
keeps
crapping
out
constantly
making
it
really
annoying
to
use
the
sound
quality
is
okay
yet
not
great
the
touch
commands
doesn't
do
what
the
manual
said
they
would
do
overall
not
satisfied
with
this
buy
recommend
this
earphone
write
this
review
after
one
month
of
using
the
high
quality
sound
makes
my
day
and
the
comfortable
fit
won
popping
off
even
while
running
also
they
re
nice
noise
canceling
earbuds
for
sleeping
we
have
purchased
two
of
these
and
we
use
them
when
we
run
they
sound
great
and
are
easy
to
use
we
had
an
issue
with
one
pair
not
syncing
with
each
other
but
emailed
the
company
and
they
sent
us
new
pair
right
away
battery
on
right
earbud
won't
hold
charge
am
week
away
from
the
one
year
warranty
expiration
i've
sent
in
request
to
the
company
for
replacement
we'll
see
what
happens
can
hear
fine
out
of
the
right
ear
but
the
left
ear
has
completely
quit
working
it
charges
as
if
it's
working
but
nothing
happens,
even
after
resetting
everything
and
charging
for
long
time
it's
very
frustrating
because
have
spoken
so
highly
of
these
earbuds
and
now
wish
wish
would
have
just
gotten
the
apple
kind
better
than
expected
dont
like
them
at
all,
they
shark
when
in
ears,
they
dont
work
when
youre
on
facetime
with
someone,
and
they
go
down
in
ear
too
far
super
comfortable
in
the
ears,
is
really
cool
that
the
charging
case
for
the
ear
buds
also
charges
my
phone,
and
sound
quality
and
volume
is
amazing
over
all
extremely
happy
with
product
and
would
purchase
again
for
friend
or
family
member
great
product,
well
worth
the
price
light
weight,
good
fit
and
great
sound
quality
well
worth
the
price
the
buds
felt
good
as
soon
as
put
them
in,
but
they
come
with
different
sized
gaskets
so
should
fit
about
anyone
the
sound
is
solid
and
the
case
was
almost
fully
charged
when
it
arrived
so
was
very
user
friendly
so
far
everything
has
been
easy
bought
these
for
my
teenager,
but
about
months
in,
she
said
they
don't
have
the
same
level
of
sound
in
both
ears
double
checked
the
balance
etc
now
on
the
search
for
replacement
not
worth
the
money
loved
the
earbuds,
the
sound
and
noise
cancellation
were
amazing
but
the
right
one
stopped
working
with
months
of
use
it
supposed
to
have
one
year
warranty,
but
getting
the
seller
to
take
care
of
it
has
been
impossible
great
earphones
the
earbuds
work
amazing,
and
they
are
really
good
quality
for
the
price
easy
to
connect
to
your
device
really
liked
the
packaging
and
the
little
bag
that
comes
with
the
earbuds
they
last
very
long
time
and
very
convenient
to
use
recommend
these
earbuds
ear
buds
are
awesome
use
them
when
workout
and
they
fit
in
my
ears,
stay
in
snuggly
although,
my
ten
year
old
uses
them
more
than
do
and
she
really
thinks
the
charging
case
is
the
coolest
would
recommend
these
ear
buds
without
question
did
not
work
for
me
on
my
iphone
other
party
could
not
hear
me
well
had
been
using
wired
earbuds
to
the
gym
and
switching
to
these
has
made
things
far
easier
so
far
these
earbuds
have
worked
with
zero
problems
and
the
battery
life
has
suited
me
perfectly
the
case
is
small
and
compact,
yet
still
fashionable
great
product
nothing
fit
great
comfortable
easy
pairing,love
case
overall
excellentbproductno,complaints
not
cheap
but
love
them,they
lasts
almost
hours
before
having
to
be
charged
in
the
charging
case
received
these
earbuds
as
graduation
present
and
haven
stopped
using
them
since
wear
them
daily,
the
battery
life
lasts
and
it
holds
it
place
when
workout
music
quality
is
great
and
it
doesn
seem
to
look
massive
in
my
ear
highly
recommended
the
product
look
good
but
failed
after
month
use
not
worth
it
the
left
don
pair
with
phone
anymore
was
unable
to
pair
the
earbuds
with
my
device
the
item
may
have
been
defective,
working
to
obtain
replacement
through
protection
plan
these
were
awesome
when
they
were
brand
new,
but
now,
after
about
months
of
use,
can
barely
hear
sound
out
of
them
with
the
volume
all
the
way
up
on
my
phone
about
day
after
having
them,
the
magnetic
hold
for
the
left
one
quit
working
like
said,
great
out
of
the
gate,
now
don't
even
us
them
and
am
looking
for
another
brand
mainly
use
these
when
walk
and
the
sound
quality
is
okay
but
the
sound
cuts
in
and
out
like
the
bluetooth
connection
is
getting
lost
the
battery
life
only
lasts
about
hours
so
have
had
them
run
out
when
go
on
long
hikes
great
quality
for
the
price
like
the
pads
they
are
very
convenient
also
like
how
they
connect
with
google
assistant
am
very
pleased
with
this
purchase
had
these
for
months
and
then
they
stopped
working
either
left
or
right
will
play
volume
but
not
both
at
the
same
time
tried
to
get
theses
replaced
and
had
no
luck
at
all
don't
buy
these
love
these
wireless
earbuds
great
battery
life
and
good
quality
the
design
is
simple
and
user
friendly
great
earbuds
ears
did
not
hurt
at
all
while
wearing
them
sound
is
great
these
were
terrible
the
volume
has
just
disappeared
they
show
they
are
charging
when
they
are
not
would
not
recommend
this
product
wish
had
n't
waited
to
long
to
get
refund
great
form
and
sound
these
are
my
first
bluetooth
headphones
have
ever
purchased,
and
absolutely
love
them
they
are
nice
fit,
the
range
is
decent,
and
the
sound
quality
is
great
my
only
issues
is
the
battery
life,
fully
charge
only
last
about
hour
overall,
great
purchase
me
calzan
muy
bien
en
mi
oreja
por
ser
pequeña,
pero
he
usado
otros
con
mejor
sonido
pero
están
muy
bien
en
relación
calidad
precio
los
uso
diario
right
ear
sound
barely
working
about
months
in
to
the
purchase
sound
quality
is
workable
but
the
fact
that
can't
have
this
replaced
is
dissapointing
would
recommend
getting
different
brand
and
add
warrenty
if
its
cheap
works
great
bought
these
on
whim
and
was
totally
blown
away
by
the
quality
of
sound
and
battery
life
worth
it
if
you
don't
want
to
spend
lot
on
bluetooth
earbuds
like
them
haven't
worn
them
muchno
particular
reason
they
work
fine
for
me
ve
really
enjoyed
these
earbuds
the
noise
cancellation
works
well
because
they
allow
you
to
switch
out
the
silicone
parts
so
you
can
find
one
that
fits
best
for
your
ear
shape
what
most
impressive
is
the
battery
life
can
go
week
without
charging
the
dock
great
sound
quality
light
weight,
great
fit
for
my
ear
and
holding
pretty
well
when
am
running
battery
life
is
not
bad,
can
rotating
use
one
of
them
each
time,
it
goes
all
day
long
no
problem
like
these
earbuds
lot
because
they
fit
my
ears
better
than
other
earbuds
however,
the
charging
case
stopped
working
after
few
weeks
and
ve
yet
to
hear
response
from
pasonomi
even
though
they
are
still
under
warranty
the
ear
buds
fit
my
ears
very
well
they
are
very
loud
and
excellent
sound
quality
would
absolutely
buy
them
again
very
easily
set
up
with
bluetooth
connections
and
comes
with
nice
hard
case
an
carry
bag
better
sound
than
thought
they
would
have,
very
comfortable
to
wear
lightweight
and
sleek
liked
them
more
than
expected
the
things
like
about
most
of
this
product
is
the
fact
that's
cordless,
easy
to
connect
and
disconnect
from
phonethe
thing
dislike
is
the
fact
that
when
it's
in
my
pocket
one
side
could
lose
connection
or
one
side
will
be
louder
than
the
other
these
earbuds
are
tiny,
convenient
and
perfect
for
workout
use
them
every
time
when
am
in
the
gym
and
they
never
drop
when
running
great
product
they're
great
but
eventually
my
right
earbud
stopped
charging
completely
attempted
cleaning
charging
contacts,
etc,
and
nothing
dead
as
hammer
terrible
productright
ear
bud
stopped
working
after
monthsi
emailed
the
manufacturer
and
no
responsedon
waste
your
money
for
the
most
part
these
worked
fine,
but
now
almost
months
later
the
right
ear
bud
won
pair
or
work
anymore
this
product
was
$0
and
it
worked
months
am
out
of
the
return
or
support
window
so
not
good
buy
don
recommend
the
headphones
were
easy
to
pair
up
and
start
using
with
minimal
effort
they
have
great
look
and
feel
and
be
easily
taken
out
for
quick
break
in
working
out
like
the
carrying
case
and
how
the
magnetic
case
keeps
the
ear
buds
tight
in
the
case
these
ear
phones
not
only
have
good
sound
quality,
they
are
also
comfortable
fit;
they
do
not
bug
you
and
do
not
fall
out
while
working
out
love
these
ear
buds
they
pair
effortlessly,
the
sound
quality
is
very
good,
and
battery
life
is
close
to
hours
highly
recommended
wow
the
sound
quality
in
these
are
very
good
they
paired
seamlessly
to
my
pixel
xl
and
stayed
in
ear
while
working
out
would
definitely
recommend
these
were
lot
better
than
expected
the
sound
quality
is
good
with
decent
amount
of
bass
enjoy
the
tap
feature
on
the
earbud
to
skip,
pause,
play,
etc
my
first
pair
of
bluetooth
earbuds
and
would
recommend
got
very
impressed
with
the
battery
life
of
this
earbuds,
expect
it
to
have
good
sound
quality
but
never
expect
to
have
such
long
battery
life,
especially
with
the
price
range
very
happy
with
the
purchase
purchased
these
as
low
cost
replacement
for
jabra
headset
everyone
complains
about
background
noise
when
join
calls
switching
between
phone
and
laptop
is
nightmare
these
would
be
great
as
headset
for
working
out,
but
don't
fit
my
need
for
skype,
teams,
webex
and
phone
calls
made
sure
they
were
charged
first
it
took
while
for
them
to
sync
to
my
phone
after
finally
getting
that
done
found
out
that
only
was
working
still
haven
been
able
to
get
the
second
one
to
work
yet
the
sound
out
of
the
one
working
is
good
and
my
husband
loves
how
they
fit
but
they
were
little
big
for
my
ears
these
things
are
great
had
some
slight
problems
with
the
buds
completely
cutting
off
and
going
dead
even
thought
the
batter
was
fully
charged,
but
that
only
happened
one
time
love
these
recently
purchased
these
earbuds
and
they
are
amazing
love
the
quality
and
the
charging
case
would
gladly
purchase
these
again
as
gift
for
anyone
of
my
family
members
i've
been
using
these
for
few
hours
since
got
them
today,
for
the
price
tag
alone
they
are
worth
it
the
sound
quality
is
much
better
than
expected,
good
bass
levels
and
the
earbuds
alone
don't
feel
cheap
when
inside
your
ear
very
light
weight
and
can't
think
of
current
reason
to
rate
any
less
than
stars
would
not
recommend
at
all
to
buy
this
bluetooth
headphones
the
sound
is
poor,
no
noice
cancelling,
what
is
that
basically
waste
of
money
the
connection
and
the
commands
to
handled
the
divice
does
not
respond
as
expected
wanted
to
say
that
i've
been
having
great
time
with
this
product
and
that
they
are
well
worth
the
investment
great
sound
quality
and
battery
life
have
made
my
working
life
much
happier
thank
you
for
this
product
great
product
sound
quality
is
good
looks
stylish
easy
to
carry
bought
this
as
gift
for
my
niece
for
christmas
she
absolutely
loves
it
my
husband
needed
pair
so
bought
them
again
he
loves
them
too
great
buy
might
just
buy
me
pair
too
just
like
description
loud
sounds
great
love
these
earbuds
used
to
have
wired
headphones
and
hated
those
because
they
always
get
in
the
way
when
run
but
now
that
have
these,
they
always
stay
secure
and
never
distract
me
when
exercise
will
definitely
refer
to
friends
absolutely
was
blown
away
by
the
quality
for
the
price
the
sound
is
great,
they
include
plenty
of
inserts
of
different
sizes
for
great
fit,
and
the
touch
controls
are
great
perfect
for
workouts
the
quality
and
sound
was
really
good
the
only
thing
didn
like
was
how
uncomfortable
it
is
compared
to
apple
earphones
which
was
big
let
down
for
me
it
feels
stiff
in
the
ear
but
overall
it
decent
for
the
price
just
got
the
item
today,
had
little
paring
issue
at
first
but
worked
out
fine
after
sound
quality
seems
so
far
so
good
was
looking
for
bluetooth
earbud
to
use
during
my
workout,
and
especially
wirless
one
so
don
have
line
surround
me
this
item
came
as
description

well
sound
quality

worth
the
money
the
decent
bluetooth
earbuds
was
delivered
with
perfect
packing

and
excellent
qualityfast
charging
they
work
great
and
the
adjustable
ear
silicone
things
are
helpful
they
died
after
few
hours
which
surprised
me
thought
they
would
last
longer
the
next
person
i'm
talking
to
heard
the
cracking
noise
can't
understand
me
son
loves
them
bought
these
headphones
on
may
and
it
is
now
jan
and
one
of
the
head
pieces
no
longer
works
and
will
not
charge
reaching
out
to
the
seller
now
to
see
if
they
will

love

double
tap
for
next
how
easy
bought
another
as
gift
this
are
awesome
like
others
have
stated,
they
lack
bass
otherwise
good
product
and
great
battery
life
i've
been
more
than
happy
with
these
ear
buds
sound
quality,
range,
battery
life,
comfort
it
hits
all
the
major
selling
points
has
better
range
and
sound
than
other
more
expensive
brands
i've
had
in
the
past
recommend
these
to
everyone
meet
so
far
they
are
amazing
have
had
them
maybe
two
monthsi
have
used
them
for
some
runs,
and
they
work
really
well
they
pair
well
really
am
thankful
for
themand
they
were
in
expensive
i've
charged
the
dock
twice,
bit
it
really
didn't
even
need
it
love
them
these
are
amazing
did
have
the
right
earbud
go
out
just
couple
of
weeks
into
using
them,
but
it
was
simple
switch
of
product
when
requested
replacements
they
sent
them
out
right
away
these
sound
amazing
and
are
great
for
running
sound
was
weak
in
the
highs,
mids,
and
lows,
bit
loud
enough
but
for
non
music
critiquing,
they
seemed
convenient
enough
but
too
expensive
for
quality
in
my
opinion
good
work
these
are
better
than
my
beats
in
every
way
sound
quality
both
when
listening
to
music
and
when
on
phone
calls
is
very
good
impressed
great
sound,
but
as
many
others
experienced,
the
right
earpiece
is
completely
intermittent
one
of
the
earbuds
not
working
unable
to
return
purchased
as
gift
for
someone
out
of
the
country
disappointed
would
give
this
higher
rating
but
when
go
for
walk
outside,
the
right
earbud
sound
will
go
in
and
out,
it
is
not
disconnecting
from
my
bluetooth
it
is
an
annoyance
have
older
bluetooth
earbuds
that
don't
do
this
email
the
company
but
no
response
yet
perfect
to
workout
and
not
too
expensive,
the
sound
quality
it
perfect
not
the
best
bass
ever,
but
what
do
you
expect
from
something
so
small
and
relatively
inexpensive
they
are
who
we
thought
they
are
they
get
the
job
done
these
things
are
amazing
dropped
in
coolant
tank
at
work
took
my
min
to
find
it
completely
submerged
pulled
it
out
hit
it
with
the
air
hose
perfectly
fine
dude
will
by
more
pairs
in
succession
not
comfortable
great
disappointed
great
for
watching
movies,
horrible
for
phone
calls
my
right
headphone
doesn't
put
out
sound
anymore
but
can
figure
out
where
to
go
to
do
warranty
support
any
ideas
they
were
alright
otherwise
the
battery
life
and
sound
quality
for
what
you
pay
is
great
the
ear
buds
feel
nice,
snug,
and
comfortablethe
battery
case
lasts
long
time
and
the
added
functionality
as
power
bank
is
welcome
addition
over
all
solid
for
the
price
use
them
when
lifting
weights
or
running
and
have
had
absolutely
zero
issues
for
me
they
re
very
comfortable
and
stay
secure
even
during
strenuous
exercisethe
charging
hub
doubling
as
powerpack
is
great
too
really
enjoyed
these
headphones
when
they
were
in,
couldn
hear
anything
else
in
the
gym
unless
my
music
was
paused
it
sounds
great
too
it
does
die
fast
kind
of
fast,
but
they
also
charge
fast
with
great
portable
charger
the
fit
of
the
bluetooth
ear
piece
is
very
confortable
and
the
battery
life
is
outstanding
great
earbuds
for
the
price
convenient
and
easy
to
charge
and
store
customer
service
was
great
quick
responses
and
cordial
and
patient
representative
happy
with
the
purchase
easy
to
pair,
sound
quality
is
great
and
the
buds
are
very
comfortable
nice
great
inexpensive
option
to
bluetooth
headphones
great
for
working
out
have
not
experienced
any
slippage
regards
of
the
conditions
or
the
movement
liked
how
easily
the
bluetooth
picks
up
my
iphone
comfortable
also
there
was
little
to
no
bass,
got
really
buzzy
otherwise
they
look
really
nice
and
feel
nice
for
working
out
under
hours
these
are
great
excellent
sound
quality
fit
and
stay
in
the
ear
canal
during
work
out,
great
only
problem
have
is
the
battery
life
doesn't
last
as
long
as
advertised
they
say
they
last
hours
but
we're
only
getting
hours
max
out
of
them
just
wished
they
lasted
longer
for
working
in
the
gardens
out
around
the
house
absolutely
no
bass,
low
volume
through
other
ranges
other
brands
are
better
does
not
charge
with
wireless
charge
pad
these
have
amazing
sound
and
good
battery
life,
the
most
important
thins
isthe
bluetooth
headphone
is
staying
connection
really
love
it
this
headphone
is
super
easy
to
understand
and
efficient
the
sound
quality
is
also
great
would
recommend
this
to
my
gym
friends
it
easy
to
carry
and
it
come
with
the
portable
battery
case
from
now
on,
don
have
to
deal
with
wires
at
the
gym
anymore
easy
to
pair
with
my
device
iphone
*
for
the
price
point
nice
quality
and
decent
sound
was
satisfied
in
the
beginning
even
though
had
issues
with
the
recharging
of
one
of
the
earbuds
but
it
was
solved
the
sound
is
great
for
the
price
but
my
right
earbuds
can't
connect
with
my
left
one
and
it's
only
leaving
me
with
beeping
sound
like
it's
trying
to
connect
so
now
only
have
one
functioning
earbud
the
sound
is
good
0/0
for
me
they
are
comfortable
when
wear
them
they
dont
fall
of
they
were
easy
to
pair
with
my
phone
highly
recommend
these
to
anyone
looking
for
wireless
headphones
the
sound
is
so
clear
and
precise
can
tell
the
difference
in
these
and
my
more
expensive
white
earpods
excellent
purchase
these
are
good,
but
you
can
only
use
the
left
one
by
itself
can't
not
use
the
right
one
by
itself
really
enjoy
these
headphones
perfect
for
my
commutes
using
transit
the
charing
dock
holds
multiple
charges
and
the
headphones
do
charge
quicky;
which
makes
the
battery
use
time
not
that
big
of
deal
would
buy
again
worked
great
for
few
months,
then
couldn't
get
sound
out
of
right
earbud
kept
following
instructions
to
reset,
but
repeatedly
failed
to
connect
correctly
support
not
helpful
finally
gave
up
earbuds
are
comfortable
for
me
as
cannot
wear
normal
pods
in
my
ear
they
rub
and
hurt
these
feel
nice
and
the
distance
they
transmit
is
good
enough
for
my
work
environment
perfect
this
is
total
scam
the
earbuds
stopped
charging
after
two
months
now
own
paper
weight
because
they
don
work
the
earbuds
had
short
in
them
after
week
of
use
and
now
the
right
ear
is
completely
non
working
haven
had
these
earbuds
for
months
yet
these
are
great
except
my
left
earbud
stopped
working
haven't
even
had
them
three
months
listen
to
books
at
work
all
day
with
these
many
charges
can
be
done
with
the
case
and
the
device
battery
life
is
awesome
i've
gotten
these
as
gifts
as
well
highly
recommend
i've
only
used
these
for
about
hour
but
right
off
the
bat
noticed
that
these
buds
dont
have
bass
to
they
also
wished
the
ear
tips
fit
in
little
better
as
for
the
pro's
like
the
sensor
touch
pads
on
then
how
they
fit
in
the
canals
of
my
ears
it
kept
unpairing
and

0stars
this
is
great
set
of
ear
buds
they
can
be
used
as
stereo
or
mono
nice
fit
they
were
decent
at
first,
but
the
right
side
started
cutting
in
and
out
like
fraying
wire
on
wired
headphones
the
battery
life
of
them
is
decent
for
the
price,
but
if
haven't
touched
them
or
the
case
in
week
or
two,
they'd
both
be
completely
dead
not
sure
why
both
batteries
would
completely
drain
without
any
use

also

from
the
manufacturer,
they
offered
full
refund
for
the
product
waiting
on
the
refund
,
given
good
customer
service
i'd
recommend
them
just
opened
up
my
buds
today,
super
easy
to
pair
with
my
phone
the
tap
controls
work
great
and
the
charging
station
makes
it
easy
to
keep
organized
and
fully
charged
love
these
headphones
just
got
them
today
and
have
to
say
extremely
impressed,
for
wireless
headphones
in
the
0$
price
range
these
take
the
cake
they
are
just
the
right
size
with
very
great
sound
quality
and
good
noise
cancellation
would
recommend
these
to
anyone
looking
for
relatively
in
expensive
wireless
earbuds
bang
for
your
buck,
use
it
in
the
gym
and
they
never
fault
out
or
come
loose
work
extremely
well,
very
comfortable
in
my
ears
the
sound
quality
is
good
and
it
connected
easily
to
my
devices
don't
recommend
it
bad
mic
bad
bluetooth
connection
the
left
one
start
make
noise
sound
while
it
is
on
they
are
really
good
product
connecting
to
the
phone
calls
is
little
challenging
but
all
in
all
will
certainly
be
buying
few
more
pairs
for
christmas
presents
good
purchase
for
the
price
just
received
my
earbuds
they
were
recommended
by
coworker
the
earbuds
are
lightweight,
easy
to
pair
with
android
device,
and
has
great
sound
quality
must
have
in
earbuds
for
me
is
great
bass
sound,
which
these
offer
the
earphone
is
in
good
quality
and
looks
durable
feel
comfortable
when
i'm
wearing
it
it
does
help
lot
when
want
to
listen
to
some
music
during
work
out
bluetooth
is
easy
to
set
up,
no
problem
with
the
connection
like
these
they
fit
perfect
in
my
ears
these
are
amazing
headphones
was
kind
of
skeptical
at
first
because
have
never
used
wireless
headphones
before
but
these
are
amazing
they
cancel
out
the
noise
and
you
can
barely
hear
noise
even
when
there
is
nothing
playing
would
0/0
recommend
purchased
these
headphones
for
my
son
the
quality
is
excellent,
fits
nicely
in
his
ear
he
likes
how
you
can
pause
the
music
on
the
earbud
itself
and
not
have
to
use
his
phone
to
do
this
overall
we
are
very
happy
with
the
quality
of
this
product
good
in
the
beginning
the
sound
was
ok,
good
to
listen
my
audiobooks,
noise
cancellation
was
poor,
battery
used
to
last
hours
after
month
the
sound
dropped
to
half,
barely
can
hear,
sound
cancellation
doesn
exist
now,
don
recommend
the
product
the
price
paid
was
total
waste
sound
quality
and
the
way
it
sounds
to
people
on
the
other
end
of
the
phone
is
great
music
sounds
great
it
dropped
the
blue
tooth
couple
of
times
while
on
phone
call
that
my
only
complaint
otherwise,
like
them
lot
got
these
on
may
0th
they
were
good
for
what
needed
them
for,
but
stopped
working
after
the
return
window
was
closed
tried
talking
to
customer
service,
but
couldn't
understand
the
person
very
well
then
got
disconnected
i'm
so
disappointed
in
this
product
now
have
$0
pair
of
bluetooth
earbuds
that
don't
work
like
these
things
they
are
just
the
right
size
for
easy
handling,
and
tucking
in
pocket
they
work
well
with
all
of
my
devices
purchased
these
may
and
within
months
with
minimal
use
they
stopped
working
going
to
contact
the
company
to
see
if
they
can
refund
me
or
replace
them
so
disappointed
if
could
give
this
product
negative
review
would
these
are
great
value
the
sound
quality
is
great
it
takes
second
to
figure
out
how
they
sit
in
your
ear,
but
one
you
figure
it
out,
they
re
great
love
this
because
needed
for
work
only
charge
once
for
an
hour
on
my
lunch
break
in
between
uses
lasts
me
hours
at
time
very
disappointed
does
not
hold
charge
for
long
the
sound
quality
is
good
but
unable
to
speak
to
anyone
with
this
device
lacks
bass
but
all
round
awesome
sound
quality,
durability,
an
battery
life
for
such
device
they
are
pretty
bulky
and
noticeable
they
are
touch
sensitive,
so
keep
playing
even
though
you
intended
to
pause
your
sound
not
great
for
audible
books
noise
cancellation
is
not
good
at
all
good
for
used
love
when
have
them
in
can
concentrate
love
that
the
battery
life
is
great
but
when
speaking
with
someone
they
say
they
don't
hear
me
well
these
works
fine
for
day
or
two,
then
the
volume
started
to
decrease
and
would
not
increase
crap
product
will
stick
to
wired
earbuds
so
glad
found
these
amazing
battery
life
these
wireless
earbuds
are
great
they
rest
perfectly
in
the
ear
and
cancel
out
all
background
noise
the
sound
better
than
was
expecting
them
to
be
was
iffy
about
ordering
these
because
they
were
not
common
brands
but
don't
regret
my
decision
these
earbuds
are
super
easy
to
pair,
the
volume
is
great,
there
were
few
hisses
in
high
vocals
was
listening
to
the
flaming
lips
am
far
from
an
audiophile,
but
for
bucks
you
can't
do
any
better
they
sound
better
than
air
pods
and
you
don't
look
like
ben
stiller
great
wireless
earbudsit
better
than
what
expected,
especially
the
case
can
turn
into
power
bank
to
charge
the
phone
or
other
device
tooalso
can
register
to
product
the
item
and
get
small
gift
through
their
email
pairing
is
pretty
easy
work
really
well
and
for
good
amount
of
time
sound
is
pretty
good
for
such
small
set
of
completely
wireless
earbuds
love
the
charging
case
that
keeps
charging
the
buds
for
several
days
it
every
nice
the
battery
on
the
head
phones
is
around
to
hours
with
max
volume
they
fit
in
the
ear
perfectthe
only
thing
dislike
about
is
the
battery
for
the
ear
piece
was
really
surprised
by
how
loud
they
are
the
multifunctional
touch
is
very
easy
to
remember
and
very
user
friendly
they
also
stay
snug,
yet
comfortable
in
my
ear
these
fit
nicely
and
are
easy
to
use
the
sound
quality
is
good
and
am
enjoying
using
them
they
look
more
expensive
than
they
are
definitely
worth
try
if
you're
looking
for
new
earbuds
they
are
heavy
and
big
and
don
stay
put
in
your
ear
perfect
in
all
ways
like
these
earbuds
last
long
but
the
only
issue
have
is
the
call
quality
tried
them
once,
like
my
old
lg
blues
tooth
better
very
little
bass
could
deal
with
that
if
they
still
worked
but
they
don
work
anymore
they
say
power
on
they
are
definitely
charged
but
will
no
longer
connect
to
my
phone
after
just
couple
months
purchased
these
earbuds
couple
weeks
ago
and
am
shockingly
surprised
how
happy
am
with
them
great
quality
for
the
price
they
work
great,
easy
to
set
up
and
comfortable
to
wear
would
definitely
recommend
have
to
say
as
soon
as
they
arrived
was
ready
to
test
them
after
minute
jam
session
in
the
shower
and
wearing
them
for
another
while
cleaning
my
house
they
are
wonderfuli
highly
recommend
they're
awesome
comfortable
and
sound
great
received
today,
so
far
these
ear
buds
are
easy
to
pair
and
sound
fantastic
great
earbuds
fit
way
better
than
my
airpods
good
sound
and
battery
life
use
this
product
while
at
work
and
no
one
noticed
which
was
great
thing
,
the
sound
was
very
clear
and
nice
volume
also
used
them
at
the
gym
and
they
fit
perfectly
,
they
stayed
in
place
garbarge
they
stopped
connecting
to
each
other
after
little
over
month
sound
quality
is
mediocre
at
best
use
these
everyday
for
work
and
love
them
the
only
thing
is
that
the
mic
when
talking
on
the
phone
with
them
isnt
that
good,
but
that's
the
only
downfall
otherwise,
worth
the
buy
great
noise
canceling
survives
my
0plus
hr
gym
sessions
loved
it
at
first
now
can
get
it
to
pair
with
any
device
ve
tried
everything
the
only
downside
noticed
was
it
didn
tell
me
who
was
calling
just
the
phone
number
the
price
is
decent,
build
seems
decent,
fit
is
good,
but
the
sound
is
terrible
very
weak
bass
the
regular
frequencies
also
seemed
unclear
and
weak
they
are
constantly
cutting
off
either
one
or
both
keep
having
to
put
this
back
in
the
case
to
get
them
to
work
again
disconnecting
and
then
reconnecting
doesn
work
total
waste
of
money
out
of
the
box
left
side
didn't
work
great
ear
buds,
use
them
at
work
and
they
block
out
unwanted
noises
it
was
too
big
for
my
ear
lobe
it
did
not
fit
right
used
for
phone
and
watching
movies
this
bluetooth
is
very
convenient
and
practical
when
am
working,
the
design
is
also
very
userfriendly
and
the
sound
quality
is
very
clear
like
it
very
much
it
can
take
long
time
for
each
charge
think
will
recommend
my
friend
this
wireless
earbud
is
amazing,
good
quality
it
best
one
that
have
earbuds
the
charge
case
that
you
can
use
for
powerbank
to
you
cellphone
love
it
very
much
ve
had
these
for
less
than
year
suddenly
my
right
ear
bud
volume
is
significantly
less
than
my
left
with
no
way
to
fix
it
very
disappointed
worth
it
for
the
bucks
can
complain,
make
sure
to
wash
your
ears
so
your
ear
wax
doesn
muffle
the
sound
lol
great
product
they
fit
really
well
and
so
far
they
do
not
skip
at
all
sound
quality
is
good
better
than
most
products
in
this
price
range
i've
been
looking
for
good
pair
of
headphones
for
while
great
product
overall
easy
set
up
and
works
very
well
with
iphone
used
this
while
exercising
and
voice
quality
was
great
the
only
thing
is
it
doesn
fits
my
ear
very
well
at
first,
but
it
comes
with
different
sizes
rubber
things
to
fit
my
ear
and
solve
this
issue
eventually
it
is
pretty
good
anyway
awesome,
blows
my
beats
outta
the
water
so
comfortable
barely
notice
them
on
charging
case
comes
in
handy
the
noise
cancellation
is
ok
the
product
overall
performance
is
good
until
it
decides
not
to
work
it's
not
pricey
but
the
quality
is
disappointing
wouldn't
recommend
purchasing
it
love
these
wear
them
every
night
at
work
lost
one
of
my
ear
buds
from
the
previous
pair
bought,
after
trying
different
brand
came
back
and
bought
another
set
of
these
very
happy
with
the
sound
quality
and
the
comfort
sounds
great,
comfortable
and
the
batteries
last
longer
than
what
thought
they
would
very
compact
and
slique
the
earbuds
fit
comfortably
and
the
sound
quality
is
pretty
good
the
noise
cancellation
was
pretty
good
too
very
easy
to
connect
to
my
phone
and
my
ipad
comfortable
and
discrete
arrived
0days
earlier
then
predicted
recommend
these
to
anyone
wanting
good
quality
earbuds
without
breakinh
the
bank
mine
have
never
worked
have
reach
out
to
try
and
get
it
resolved,
but
no
answer
have
also
been
unable
to
returnvery
disappointed,
but
guess
that
is
risk
you
take
when
you
opt
to
buy
cheap
version
seems
good
for
the
price
happy
will
see
if
they
last
like
this
earbus
lot,
much
better
than
my
oem
wired
earphone
the
sound
is
clear
with
decent
bass
easy
to
carry
aroundthe
mobile
charge
is
tiny,
doesnt
take
much
space
in
my
backpackbeen
using
it
to
jogging
at
gym
without
any
connection
problem
so
far
like
the
fact
that
these
earbuds
are
light
in
weight
they
cancel
noise
and
did
recommend
this
to
two
of
my
other
friends
so
far
just
got
mine
today
so
far
so
good
not
very
good
terrible
sound
quality
my
$0
panasonic
wired
earbuds
are
about
times
better
sound
quality
wise
the
right
earbud
crackled
about
minutes
into
run
and
also
they
had
difficulty
connecting
to
each
other
don
waste
your
money
they
re
junk
says
waterproof
but
that
is
absolutely
not
true
the
outside
of
the
earbuds
don't
work
when
water
touches
them
and
now
after
getting
them
wet
the
right
one
has
completely
stopped
worming
all
together
these
earphones
are
amazing
ordered
them
and
got
them
on
the
same
daythey
don
died
fast
the
charging
case
can
stay
on
for
days
straight
without
out
dieting
and
when
have
it
in
really
can
hear
anythingthey
at
also
very
easy
to
hide
if
don
want
people
to
know
that
got
headphones
in
great
product
and
great
pricing
i've
bought
of
these
so
far,
they
are
amazing
bought
this
couple
of
months
ago
and
i'm
very
pleased
with
the
sound
and
fit
the
sound
quality
was
amazing
and
everyone
in
the
family
was
impressed
it
not
working
properly
gifted
it
someone
and
they
couldn
use
or
now
that
couldn
even
return
thatas
it
was
given
as
gift
can
take
it
back
got
these
headphones
few
days
ago,
they
have
very
great
audio
for
the
price
point
and
even
wore
them
in
the
shower
with
no
problems
would
recommend
to
anyone
that
is
looking
for
reasonably
priced
pair
of
quality
bluetooth
headphones
pros
decent
price,
the
fit
is
okcons
will
fall
out
if
you
move
to
much,
no
volume
control
on
ear
buds
it
took
awhile
to
pair
up
with
new
phone
the
first
pair
had
balance
issue
one
earbud
significantly
louder
than
the
other
at
the
same
volume
setting,
but
they
replaced
that
pair
with
new
pair
that
did
not
have
the
issue
yr
old
loves
them
it
works
good
but
it
falls
out
of
my
ear
lot
think
the
sound
quality
is
good
love
the
charging
case,
it
makes
very
and
it's
easy
to
keep
the
headphones
charged
up
sound
is
great,
but
the
battery
life
is
almost
non
existent
gave
these
fair
try
straight
days
of
charging
them
overnight,
only
for
them
to
last
less
than
hours
the
next
day
my
$0
bluetooth
headphones
last
longer
these
are
the
best
bluetooth
earbuds
have
ever
owned
the
battery
lasts
forever
and
the
sound
quality
is
great
charging
and
carrying
them
around
is
so
practical
great
headphones
awesome
for
the
price
purchased
these
to
replace
some
dying
wired
bluetooth
speakers
they
fit
the
bill
just
perfectly
it's
actually
pretty
cool
that
the
little
case
doubles
as
usb
charger
for
other
accessories
too,
if
you
need
little
extra
juice
these
are
great,
work
very
well,
connect
with
zero
problem
and
keep
their
charge,
completely
worth
the
money
ease
of
setup
and
use
they
are
just
okay,
but
you
have
to
have
them
all
the
way
up
to
really
hear,
and
they
sound
quality
is
not
good
will
keep
these,
but
would
not
buy
again
use
these
all
day
while
working
at
my
desk
and
they
never
bother
me
also
use
them
while
preparing
for
my
zumba
class
and
they
never
fall
out
battery
life
is
about
to
hours
great
product
these
earbuds
are
awesome
they
ve
made
so
many
aspects
of
my
life
easier:
exercise,
cleaning,
working,
falling
asleep
they
have
great
battery
life,
and
the
charging
box
has
great
battery
life
as
well
can
recommend
these
enough
used
by
our
teenage
boy
for
several
months
so
far
&
they've
proven
very
durable
great
sound,
super
comfortable
&
excellent
battery
life
customer
service
is
awesome
thumbs
up
good
headphones
sounds
quality
is
good
charging
is
awesome
but
the
right
earbud
stopped
working
after
about
month
of
using
them
0x
week
for
about
hours
at
time
this
good
product
for
the
money
wouldn't
purchase
them
again
they
cut
out
from
time
to
time
when
you're
moving
around
overall
they
are
good
for
me
when
i'm
in
the
yard
working
not
even
months
later
they
died
☹
they
charge
and
power
up
but
they
will
no
longer
connect
first
the
right
then
the
left
days
later
this
product
is
amazing
it's
really
convenient
to
use
in
your
life
the
quality
is
excellent
don't
miss
it
these
ear
buds
came
used
so
nasty
absolutley
worthless
for
phone
calls
you
have
to
take
put
one
ear
piece
and
talk
directly
in
to
it
then
it
sounds
like
your
talking
in
tunnel
also
when
your
taking
one
out
to
talk
the
middle
button
disconnects
your
call
maybe
good
for
listening
to
music
but
not
phone
calls
read
lot
of
the
reviews
before
purchasing
that
said
sound
quality
was
good
be
happy
with
good
or
okay
but
the
quality
is
terrible
no
bass,
tinny
sounding
too
bad
because
they
fit
great
and
have
awesome
features
received
my
device
this
week
and
must
say
like
the
quality
of
the
sound
dont
hear
too
much
distraction
in
the
background
dislike,
person
was
speaking
couldn't
hear
me
good
around
alot
of
background
noise,but
definitely
use
it
for
working
out
product
is
average
the
only
negative
is
that
occasionally
when
walking
they
like
to
cut
out
like
an
old
0's
diskman
past
that
they
are
some
of
the
best
headphones
i've
ever
owned
like
the
easy
of
wear
of
the
product
you
are
getting
0$
of
headphones
don
expect
anything
crazy,
sound
quality
is
mediocre
at
best
bass
is
heavily
lacking
however,
they
are
good
for
the
price
good
quality,
for
such
an
inexpensive
price
set
up
took
only
few
seconds
with
my
iphone,
and
it
came
fully
charged
mainly
bought
these
for
the
gym,
and
they
stayed
on
my
ears
during
cardio
would
buy
again
use
these
for
the
gym
very
satisfied
they
stay
and
sound
great
bought
pairs
love
how
easy
theses
earbuds
where
to
pair
with
my
phone
they
are
light
weight
and
they
don
bother
my
ears
usually
things
in
my
ears
bother
me
wore
them
while
working
out
and
had
no
problems
would
recommend
them
to
anyone
great
for
the
price
awesome
little
ear
buds
besides
the
very
short
battery
life
can
only
get
around
hours
out
of
full
charge
was
so
existed
when
got
them
charged
them
for
0hrs
when
was
at
the
gym
they
die
on
me
after
0hr
and
0min
not
worth
the
money
unless
mine
are
damaged
price
is
good
fit
is
great
sound
is
good
for
price
bluetooth
is
garbage
signal
is
terrible
if
you
re
in
midtown
manhattan
want
to
spike
them
and
stomp
on
them
when
in
areas
like
that
things
like:they
are
easy
to
pair
can
go
into
another
room
and
they
stay
connectedyou
can
get
up
to
charges
before
you
need
to
plug
into
usb
port
to
charge
the
case
ear
buds
are
for
big
ear
not
child
or
woman
great
earpods
can
beat
the
price
for
the
quality
your
getting
they
sound
great
connecting
to
your
phone
is
seamless
everything
about
this
product
was
great
however,
one
slight
problem
was
one
earbud
was
slightly
less
as
loud,
but
it
still
blocks
off
my
surroundings
which
was
surprising
this
was
great
purchase
only
negative
was
the
hours
they
last,
charging
is
fairly
fast
can
charge
the
pack
once
and
can
recharge
through
the
work
week
like
them
but
they
are
not
loud
enough
these
are
the
most
comfortable
wireless
earbuds
i've
had
they
dont
fall
of
and
the
battery
life
is
good
also
enjoy
the
feature
of
being
able
to
charge
my
phone
havnt
had
any
issues
with
these
and
would
0/0
recommend
these
these
ear
buds
fit
my
ear
perfectly
they
stay
in
while
running,
have
some
great
bass,
easy
to
operate
would
recommend
them
these
bluetooth
headphones
have
been
one
of
the
best
bluetooth
headphones
ve
ever
purchased
sound
quality
is
great
as
well
as
the
battery
life
these
are
perfect
for
working
in
an
office
space,
we're
only
allowed
to
have
one
earbud
in
at
time
so
as
soon
as
one
dies
swap
it
out
for
the
fresh
one
and
let
it
charge
gets
me
through
to
hr
shifts
like
champ
wear
these
at
the
gym
and
when
am
doing
yard
work
sound
great
and
stays
in
the
ear
noise
cancellation
is
pretty
good,
never
really
hear
anyone
or
anything
else
at
the
gym
great
earbuds
charge
lasts
long
time
sound
quality
is
really
good
calls
sound
crystal
clear,
not
like
you're
in
tunnel
like
so
many
do
great
sound
for
buds
of
this
price
point
sweat
lot
so
they
tend
to
not
stay
put
once
get
on
some
cardio
but
neither
do
others
that
cost
twice
as
much
very
pleased
with
this
item
haven
even
owned
these
for
year
&
one
doesn
work
&
the
other
doesn
work
for
phone
calls
only
thing
can
do
it
listen
to
music
or
videos
with
one
ear
don
waste
your
money
product
was
as
advertised
,
instructions
were
clear,
no
problems,
delivery
was
prompt,
and
am
very
pleased
with
the
performance
great
bluetooth
earbuds
perfect
for
podcasts
and
audio
books
only
use
it
for
days,
and
the
bluetooth
keeps
disconnect
even
my
phone
is
next
to
it,
especially
when
make
phone
call,
it
disconnects
every
minutes
and
it's
annoying
think
it
should
be
better
than
this
with
the
price
$0
that
equal
jbl
wireless
earphones
with
better
quality
definitely
worth
the
money
the
sound
quality
is
quite
good
you
can
switch
songs
by
two
slight
taps
and
stop
songs
by
touching
the
earbud
very
satisfied
with
this
purchase
pretty
good
overall
had
an
issue
with
charging
case
at
first,
one
or
the
ears
would
turn
on
if
move
too
much
but
the
problem
stopped
now
for
some
reason
it
does
good
job
at
blocking
outside
noises
like
that
it
really
has
solid
ear
for
me,
the
sound
quality
is
amazing,
the
microphone
even
works
very
well
like
to
charge
the
phone
case
when
the
headphones
are
charged
good
quality
like
these
headphones
sound
is
okay
on
my
end
but
the
person
am
talking
to
can
not
hear
thing
earphones
came
quickly,
the
soundproofing
is
definitely
the
best
feature
as
it
functions
seamlessly
the
touch
pads
are
also
very
nice
touch
that
responds
well
the
sound
quality
is
average
with
extended
battery
life
from
the
case
convenient
and
very
usable
battery
life
probably
the
best
bang
for
your
buck
bluetooth
earbuds
out
there
sound
quality
is
excellent
and
they
feel
like
they
are
made
of
very
high
quality
materials
good
sound,
and
easy
to
connect
the
only
issue
have
is
the
battery
life
the
volume
lowers
as
the
battery
dies
good
for
hours
or
so
easy
to
use
great
sound
great
product
for
the
price
very
high
quality
will
consider
buying
another
one
one
or
both
ear
pierces
constantly
cut
in
and
out
it
reminds
me
of
listening
to
music
on
an
old
disc
man
when
the
cd
would
skip
if
light
breeze
picked
up
sound
great
and
fit
my
ears
:
that
is
all
about
works
great
if
your
not
around
interference
it
cuts
in
and
out
gave
them
to
my
wife
to
try
these
ear
buds
are
great
work
in
roofing
and
it
was
always
pain
to
have
wires
getting
in
the
way
they
are
also
very
durable
have
had
them
fall
over
feet
on
several
occasions
and
they
still
work
fine
this
product
is
better
than
the
price
overall
good
product
love
these
got
these
after
returning
air
pods
and
haven
regretted
it
since
they
stay
so
much
better
have
have
wayyyyyy
better
sound
quality
great
headphones
come
with
multiple
ear
pieces
to
fit
your
ear
only
down
side
only
charges
with
usb
to
micro
cord
no
wall
jack
pretty
much
liked
everything
the
sound
is
great
like
that
can
switch
tracks
with
tap
the
pause
feature
works
good
plus
can
answer
phone
calls
and
turn
up
the
volume
would
defiantly
recommend
theses
to
anyone
wanting
to
go
wireless
sound
quality
is
oknot
that
good
these
quit
working
within
the
first
few
days
don't
waste
your
money
battery
life
is
horrible
only
last
hrs
use
these
at
work
and
was
hoping
they
would
last
0hr
shift
great
sound
and
liked
the
power
bank
mode
but
the
right
one
stopped
working
it
doesnt
charge
or
turn
on
after
month
so
im
currently
only
using
the
left
earbud
purchased
this
as
gift
and
it
stopped
working
purchased
it
in
december
the
sound
quality
is
not
great
at
all
if
knew
would
of
been
sent
it
back
great
earbuds
the
charger
is
cool
because
it's
the
case
itself
only
drawback
my
ears
are
super
small
have
to
really
push
the
buds
in
my
ears
this
was
surprisingly
great
product
easy
to
pair
with
device
it
fit
snuggly
in
my
ear
without
falling
out
during
exercise
even
though
they
felt
heavy
in
hand,
they
did
not
feel
that
way
while
wearing
them
great
sound
quality,
battery
held
up
and
an
added
bonus
is
that
charging
case
can
charge
my
phone
too
these
wireless
headphones
are
must
have
for
super
busy
times
when
your
hands
are
unavailable
am
twin
mom
so
need
my
hands
with
these
wireless
earbuds,
can
multitask
they
are
made
good,
and
very
comfortable
to
wear
highly
recommend
these
sound
quality
is
fine
if
you
can
get
this
garbage
to
actually
connect
to
your
device
and
play
through
it
have
disconnect,
reconnect,
turn
off/on
several
times
for
it
to
connect
to
my
phone
and
play
sound
through
it
this
are
comfortable
earbuds
they
are
soft
and
easy
to
use
the
charging
stays
on
for
while
and
quickly
get
recharged
its
has
been
the
best
one
so
far,
have
tried
many
different
brands
but
this
seems
to
be
the
perfect
one
haven't
had
this
for
month
and
the
left
earbud
plays
weaker
and
lower
sound
than
the
right
one
it
doesn't
cancel
noise
nd
the
battery
life
is
hours
so
if
you're
on
plane
for
more
tha
hours
you
better
have
backup
for
future
reference
would
invest
in
more
expensive
but
better
quality
product
samrt
and
portable
the
sound
is
great
love
it
love
how
small
these
headphones
are
and
super
easy
to
put
in
they
stay
perfectly
in
my
ear
have
yet
to
work
out
with
them
but
can
tell
they
will
be
great
addition
to
my
work
out
excited
to
use
them
love
the
sound
quality
with
this
wireless
bluetooth
it's
definitely
worth
to
buy
with
the
price
like
this
it
fits
my
ears
well
unlike
the
other
brands
bought
before
always
fell
out
if
you
are
thinking
to
buy
one,
would
recommend
this
one
hard
to
believe
all
these
reviews
are
as
good
as
they
are
given
the
quality
of
bass
output
in
these
things
they're
fine
for
ear
buds
if
you
listen
to
podcasts
or
don't
need
any
equalizing
guess,
but
it
lacks
an
equalizer
and
has
almost
bass
didn't
even
last
year
these
earbuds
sync
easily,
lasted
about
hours
before
needing
to
go
back
in
the
case,
have
surprisingly
good
noise
isolation,
fit
me
well,
and
had
good
audio
clarity
best
bluetooth
earbuds
for
the
money
bought
these
for
my
gf
and
she
loves
them
these
are
great
truly
wireless
headphones
super
easy
to
charge,
pair,
and
sink
the
sound
quality
was
fantastic,
and
they
stayed
snug
in
my
ears
while
ran
outside
in
the
rain
and
did
hiit
workout
very
good
value
for
the
product
first
of
all
it
was
very
affordable
and
it
worked
my
little
barker
doesn't
make
sound
now
and
can
get
some
sleep
during
the
day
as
work
nights,
it
also
doesn't
seem
to
hurt
her
at
all
highly
recommend
this
bark
collar
these
headphones
were
super
easy
to
pair
they
work
great
for
working
out
and
listening
quality
to
music
they
stay
put
and
provide
great
sound
qulity
would
not
use
them
for
voice
calls
but
amazing
audio
use
battery
lasts
long
time
with
charging
case
the
headphones
are
great,
my
fiance
loved
them
for
father's
day
and
bought
myself
pair
complete
noise
cancellation
and
great
sound
bluetooth
was
easy
to
set
up
and
they're
great
price
bought
second
set
of
these
since
lost
the
first
one
the
first
set
had
was
great
good
sound
quality
and
decent
battery
life
the
second
set
has
been
terrible
sound
quality
has
diminished,
shorter
battery
life,
overall
just
seems
of
poorer
quality
going
to
look
elsewhere
for
wireless
earbuds
works
just
as
well
as
my
galaxy
buds
only
complaint
is
they
aren't
too
comfortable
to
wear
for
extended
periods
this
is
the
first
pair
of
truly
"wireless"
headphones
that
have
purchased
there
just
seems
to
be
so
many
out
there
firstly,
using
the
included
earbuds
was
able
to
find
the
right
size
fit
for
me
which
has
made
all
the
difference
in
sound
quality
my
last
pair
of
wireless
earbuds
had
issues
with
the
fit
and
pairing
issues
these
solved
both
problems
great
purchase
wish
there
was
better
ear
cushings
other
than
that
it's
good
product
for
the
price
would
not
buy
these
they
are
too
sensitive
to
the
touch
and
when
adjusting
in
your
ears/
removing/
putting
in
your
ears,
they
hang
up
your
phone
or
stop
music
noise
canceling
is
awful
they
will
not
disconnect
when
you
place
them
in
the
charger
and
take
phone
calls
while
in
the
case,
in
my
gym
bag
very
easy
to
connect,
great
clarity
and
comfortable
high
quality
earbuds
for
great
price
also,
quick
to
charge
and
long
battery
life
the
earbuds
have
no
bass
at
all
and
has
noise
leaking
through
these
are
great
stay
in
my
ear
&
battery
life
is
amazing
have
yet
to
charge
them
&
bought
them
at
the
end
of
june
the
charging
case
is
great
because
of
that
totally
recommend
if
you
are
looking
for
durability
and
good
price,
these
are
probably
the
best,
had
them
for
years
and
the
only
reason
stoped
using
them
was
because
los
the
earbuds
they're
ok
for
listening
to
music,
but
phone
calls
are
always
interrupted
by
loud
beeping
sound,
then
the
call
is
disconnected
absolutely
love
the
sound
quality
and
the
battery
life
is
great
use
them
while
cutting
the
grass
and
place
noise
cancelling
headphones
over
them
and
can
not
hear
thing
great
purchase
it
worked
great
at
the
beginning
but
after
months
sound
is
so
low
can
barely
hear
it
at
max
level
excellent
sound,
but
these
are
the
most
uncomfortable
earbuds
i've
ever
had
the
displeasure
of
owning
cannot
recommend
these
at
all
love
the
quality
and
that
the
sound
is
crisp
so
it
easy
to
understand
when
listening
to
someone
speaking
ve
only
had
them
for
few
days,
but
am
extremely
happy
with
my
purchase
the
sound,
the
bass
ismoderalely
heavy,
the
trebble
is
easy
sound
quality
is
good
bt
range
is
really
good
battery
life
is
great
did
not
like
the
ear
tips
they
were
too
short
for
my
liking
however
had
some
ear
tips
from
another
device
that
fit
much
better
god
product
for
the
price
these
earbuds
are
great
they
provide
awesome
sound,
are
easy
to
connect
to,
and
are
comfortable
would
recommend
these
over
and
over
again
at
first
was
little
curious
about
them
because
never
had
any
type
of
earbuds
of
this
sort
but
well
satisfied
with
the
sound
and
everything
else
they
most
definitely
was
worth
it
and
their
very
comfortable
works
great
got
as
gift
they
love
them
sent
back
the
first
pair
ordered
because
they
wouldn
hold
charge
the
second
pair
has
other
issues
the
right
one
routinely
disconnects
and
the
overall
volume
is
pitifully
low
next
time
ll
spend
more
money
on
better
quality
earbuds
buyer
beware
fits
ear
nicely
good
sound
easy
charging
and
good
fit
&
finish
stopped
working
after
months
of
low
usage
it
connects
to
the
bluetooth,
but
no
audio
sounds
good
doesn't
fall
out
of
my
ear
these
work
perfectly
with
my
phone
only
wish
the
battery
lasted
longer
but
hours
is
plenty
listen
to
daily
podcast
so
don
overuse
these
lasted
few
months
and
then
the
sound
started
cutting
in
and
out
it
is
now
impossible
to
use
these
at
all
as
they
constantly
cut
in
and
out
would
not
recommend
buying
these
just
received
these
and
they
re
great
so
far
super
comfortable
in
my
ears
and
the
buds
have
different
sized
attachments
which
is
great
the
sound
is
great
and
don
have
any
lag
with
videos
glad
got
them
these
were
disappointment
from
the
start
bluetooth
connection
dropped
continuously
so
the
music
kept
cutting
out
then
dropped
on
carpeted
floor
and
it
stopped
working
entirely
got
about
weeks
use
out
of
them
bought
different
pair
from
aliexpress
for
much
cheaper
these
are
all
chinese
made
tend
to
use
the
left
bud
more
than
both
of
them,
but
after
having
them
for
couple
weeks
the
left
is
significantly
quieter
than
the
right
and
when
put
both
in,
you
cant
even
tell
the
left
bud
is
working
really
enjoy
these
headphones
because
can
enjoy
my
music
while
my
phone
charges
and
dont
have
to
have
wire
attached
to
my
phone
while
doing
so
great
sound
quality
good
battery
life
all
around
great
product
like
the
way
it
was
so
easy
to
connect
to
my
iphone
and
and
sound
was
perfect
when
using
both
they
seem
to
know
when
to
connect
never
had
to
both
with
it
toke
the
ear
pieces
out
and
bam
they
connected
great
product
and
so
far
it
worked
out
well
sound
quality
is
nice
and
like
the
ability
to
double
tap
the
headphones
to
change
songs
and
pause
would
recommend
for
those
who
want
wireless
headphones
that
stay
in
your
ear
these
came
without
the
head
set
or
pouch
this
is
my
second
pair
it's
great
product
but
feel
like
i've
been
swindled
it
can
connect
two
devices
at
the
same
time
the
sound
quality
is
also
very
good
and
it
can
be
used
for
long
time
sound
insulation
is
also
very
good
this
was
not
worth
the
money
the
battery
life
is
less
than
hours
then
requires
charging
the
buds
fall
out
easily
as
well
perfect
for
working
out
and
everyday
use
no
complaints
from
callers
and
hear
the
other
party
clear
charging
case
is
solid
no
problems
pairing
after
three
months
of
usage
the
headphones
disconnect
from
each
other
contacted
amazon
for
help
and
they
said
they
cannot
do
anything
about
it
totally
dissapointed
at
the
beginning
they
might
feel
little
bit
uncomfortable
it
feels
like
they
create
vacuum
inside
your
ears,
but
got
used
to
it
after
while
love
not
having
the
cords
hanging
bought
these
because
my
son
teenage
friend
who
is
really
into
electronics
said
they
were
the
best
we
ve
had
them
few
months
now
and
they
are
great
easy
to
use
and
excellent
sound
the
battery
life
is
terrible,
i'm
lucky
to
get
hour
of
use
it
listening
to
music
or
podcast
you
can
get
alot
more
value
elswhere
maybe
it's
just
bad
qc,
these
headphones
quit
working
hours
after
received
them
in
the
mail
the
first
test/bluetooth
check
was
fine,
then
the
right
bud
stopped
working
and
the
volume
began
autoadjusting
it
was
bad
experience
good
it
is
over
all
very
good
product
by
having
good
sound
quality
and
having
good
noise
cancellation
really
,the
only
problem
think
of
is
that
it
sometimes
takes
to
long
for
the
headphones
to
pair
to
my
device
these
are
great
for
the
gym
workout
for
0hrs
times
week
and
the
charge
on
the
case
lasted
for
month
wow
battery
charge
only
lasts
about
minutes
unit
was
replaced
but
new
unit
is
same
poor
battery
life
these
work
really
good
my
son
is
happy
i've
owned
these
headphones
for
about
months,
use
them
daily
the
left
headphone
has
gone
quite
and
there
has
always
been
connectivity
issueswhen
they
were
new
they
sounded
great
really
was
impressed
on
delivery
it
was
earlier
than
expected
the
quality
is
good
both
sound
and
esthetic
would
recommend
to
anyone
you
don
need
to
break
the
bank
$$$$$
first
blue
tooth
device
and
it
is
awesome
honestly
pretty
good
only
problem
have
is
the
battery,
but
it
lasts
as
advertised
and
there
only
so
much
you
can
do
in
so
little
great
buy
poor
battery
life
sound
quality
is
good,
but
volume
is
too
loud
even
on
lowest
device
setting
the
earbuds
pieces
that
come
with
it
are
terribly
uncomfortable
so
replaced
them
with
the
ones
from
my
sony
ear
buds
this
helped
with
noise
cancellation
which
was
also
bad
with
original
buds
hi
bought
these
about
six
months
ago
and
was
very
satisfied
until
the
right
ear
bud
stopped
working
still
use
the
left
one,
but
that
doesn
cut
it
one
star
love
these
earbuds
they
were
super
easy
to
set
up
and
sound
quality
is
excellent
loved
that
they
stayed
in
place
during
my
cardio
workouts
would
recommend
these
to
anyone
used
for
tablet
and
phone
the
sound
quality
is
great
the
fit
is
goodi
had
had
trouble
with
others
it
took
me
times
to
pair
but
think
that
issue
was
me
not
the
buds
at
first
was
skeptical
about
the
product
because
of
the
headphone
being
so
small
once
got
them
they
fit
perfect
on
my
ears
and
the
sound
quality
was
really
good
always
wanted
airpod
but
didn
want
to
spend
the
money
this
was
great
alternative
and
happy
with
my
selection
played
with
it
for
several
days
now
not
much
to
complain
with
this
price
smooth
paring,
easy
seating,
tight
fit
just
have
to
adjust
it
to
get
the
right
angle
volume
in
left
ear
plays
at
half
the
volume
of
right
ear
battery
life
while
listening
to
music
is
approximately
hrs
not
what
is
advertised
noise
cancelling
is
joke
if
you
are
outside
recipients
can
hear
wind
andceverything
else
going
on
also
when
walking
downtown
with
tall
building
it
loses
its
bluetooth
connection
intermittently
months
in
and
right
ear
bud
does
not
work
anymore
only
the
left
they
were
great
while
they
lasted
i've
tried
couple
different
wireless
headphones
but
these
fit
my
ears
the
best
the
sounds
is
better
than
expected
and
they
are
easy
to
charge/use
definitely
recommend
loved
the
wireless
features
volume
control
and
all
the
only
issue
is
that
it
has
no
noise
cancelation
overall
great
for
the
price
bought
these
headphones
and
after
the
0nd
use,
with
fully
charged
battery,
the
headphones
started
cutting
out
and
making
weird
sound
thought
maybe
it
was
something
with
the
connection
so
disconnected
them
and
reconnected,
but
after
few
minutes
of
talk,
it
was
doing
it
again
was
pleasantly
surprised
with
wireless
earbuds
not
only
they
fitted
well
onto
my
ears
but
they
also
come
with
other
size
fittings
the
sound
is
so
clear
at
every
level
these
are
absolutely
by
far
the
best
clearest
sounding,
easiest
to
operate
most
enjoyable
to
use
and
listen
to
and
most
of
all,
all
the
reviews
back
the
product
up
believe
the
battery
life
are
balanced
believe
my
ears
need
some
rest
from
time
to
time
of
constantly
hearing
something
great
value
am
so
happy
with
this
product
unlike
other
that
ear
buds
have
tried
these
are
amazingly
comfortable
they
cam
full
charge
so
they
were
ready
to
use
and
the
are
so
easy
to
connect
to
all
of
my
bluetooth
devices
love
that
they
come
with
this
caring
case
all
in
all
it
is
an
awesome
product
and
worth
the
price
paid
for
them
love
the
ease
of
these
earphones;
from
charging
to
pairing
great
fit
in
my
ears
phone
calls
only
come
through
one
ear
bud,
otherwise
great
product
too
bulky
,
sensitive,
battery
has
low
life,
too
expensive
for
the
design,
not
satisfied
at
all
although
comfortable
and
seemingly
well
made,
these
earbuds
are
pure
treble
getting
to
desired
volume
is
an
issue
also
yes
know,
they
aren
beats
audio
headphones,
but
have
had
two
pairs
of
wireless
earbuds
before
these,
and
the
sound
quality
was
much
better
usually
have
problems
with
ear
buds
staying
in
my
ear
but
these
fit
great
great
sound
quality
and
easy
to
use
touch
pad
controls
paired
quickly
and
easily
with
no
problems
these
are
much
better
than
my
bose
bluetooth
earbuds
that
cost
me
0x
the
amount
of
these
headphones
the
fit
is
snug
and
do
not
feel
like
they
will
fall
out
like
some
headphones
do
loving
them
so
far
i've
had
these
earbuds
for
less
than
months
now
and
the
batteries
already
will
not
keep
charge
also
there
is
no
good
information
to
submit
complaint
directly
to
the
manufacturer
horrible
battery
doesn
last
longer
than
couple
of
hours
good
luck
going
on
run
or
walk
with
all
the
interference,
you
ll
be
lucky
if
you
hear
half
of
what
you
are
listening
toi
switched
to
apple
earpods
and
don
have
any
of
these
problems
with
them
was
in
the
market
for
wireless
earbuds
and
these
are
great
they
connect
immediately
as
you
take
them
out
of
the
case,
and
the
left
ear
bud
works
by
itself
bought
two
one
in
black
one
in
white
great
sound
quality
but
terrible
range
it
cuts
in
and
out
when
have
my
phone
in
my
pocket
may
be
returning
these
works
great
love
it
use
them
all
the
time
absolutely
love
these
headphones
amazing
sound
good
battery,life
waterproof
only
bad
thing
have
to
say
is
don't
like
that
there's
only
one
size
ear
bud
very
flimsy
and
poor
case
design
bluetooth
has
good
range
decent
noise
canceling
bass
isnt
great
but
thats
to
be
expected
on
pair
of
cheaper
bt
in
ears
left
earbud
would
cut
out
half
the
time
or
they
would
hang
up
the
call
few
seconds
after
answered
ve
had
these
for
just
shy
of
four
months
and
today
the
right
ear
bud
stopped
working
of
course
the
window
of
return
has
expired
this
is
my
first
set
of
wireless
ear
buds
am
very
happy
with
the
quality
and
functionality
of
them
don
have
anything
negative
to
say
about
them
use
them
for
listening
to
music
and
movies
replace
the
the
stock
ear
rubber
buds
with
normal
ones
to
increase
sound
quality
my
daughter
love
these
better
than
her
last
pair
bought
her
this
product
needs
an
app
that
can
increase
the
sound
and
bass
otherwise
it
connects
instantly
both
left
and
right
in
charges
easily
once
put
in
the
case
the
range
is
definitely
up
to
feet
and
through
walls
with
no
loss
of
connection
bought
as
birthday
gift
honestly
did
like
it
immediately
but
within
weeks
noticed
an
absolute
degradation
of
quality
the
right
bud
stopped
working
as
well
and
plays
at
lower
volume
it
works
every
now
and
then
but
it's
fickle
all
in
all
if
both
stop
working
like
they
used
to,
at
least
have
an
overpriced
powerbank
to
chare
my
phone
in
emergencies
this
is
well
designed
product,
cool
and
futuristic
looking,
also
easy
to
pair
and
connect
they
fit
comfortably,
perfect
for
running,
workout
or
mowing
the
grass
it
has
great
sound,
easy
to
use
and
to
setup
good
all
around
don't
know
really
give
bad
review
but
this
is
the
exception
listen
to
music
is
fine
but
when
start
taking
to
someone,
connection
drops
so
frequently
and
make
noise
like
old
soundtrack
please
don't
waste
your
money
would
buy
this
product
again
really
like
feature
that
it
is
basically
portable
charger
and
the
sound
is
excellent
for
me
also,
the
battery
life
of
ok
too
would
really
recommend
this
to
someone
and
my
friend
also
wants
me
to
get
her
one
love
the,the
sound
is
awesome
didn
like
the
fact
that
whenever
you
were
on
call
with
someone,
they
couldn
really
hear
you
because
it
was
muffled
or
if
you
accidentally
touched
the
earbuds,
it
would
hang
up
on
the
call
great
quality
after
losing
my
first
set
bought
another
after
having
them
for
months
they
suddenly
stopped
being
able
to
play
loudly
at
max
volume
it
only
sounds
about
half
of
normal
many
newer
headphones
are
coming
out
they
connect
pretty
sporadically
try
did
send
me
replacement
pair
for
the
ones
originally
got
but
have
the
same
issue
volume
will
go
up
and
down
occasionally
kind
of
confusing
to
connect
to
bluetooth
stoped
working
after
week
best
ear
buds
and
best
price
highly
recommend
this
product
and
they
also
ship
pretty
fast
very
good
earbuds
for
the
price
for
my
first
pair
of
wireless
earbuds
was
very
impressed
the
sound
quality
was
nothing
super
special
but
the
battery
life
was
very
long
and
the
touch
controls
on
them
were
very
convenient
the
inclusion
of
many
different
extra
fits
was
nice
as
well
my
husband
got
these
for
fathers
day,
so
had
to
try
them
out
what
an
awesome
sound,
and
very
comfortablenever
heard
of
the
brand,
but
great
price
for
them
as
well,
compared
to
brands
knew
chinese
brand
feels
cheap
gave
them
away
soon
as
seen
and
felt
the
quilty
great
quality
these
make
an
awesome
gift
for
anyone
ordered
these
in
may
can
say
used
them
that
many
times
went
to
charge
them
and
they
refused
to
charge
dead
no
product
support
stay
away
great
buy
awesome
products
sound
quality
is
great
for
voice/podcast
stuff
if
you
want
bass
you
need
to
change
the
eq
setting
in
your
phone
and
it
will
improve
just
little
bit
piece
of
garbage
this
was
the
second
set
received
after
having
connection
issues
with
the
first
set
kept
disconnecting
from
bluetooth
and
had
issues
answering
phone
calls
emailed
pasonomi
and
never
got
reply
no
customer
service
at
all
would
recommend
buying
another
brand
great
product
for
the
price
they
go
into
your
ear
way
to
deep
and
are
painful
to
wear
for
long
time
also
after
couple
weeks
of
use
the
right
ear
bud
is
going
out
definitely
not
worth
bucks
the
production
vaule
looks
like
they
where
made
with
budget
of
bucks
fantastic
headphones
that
very
much
enjoy
they're
super
low
profile
so
can
wear
them
inside
of
my
helmet,
the
sound
quality
is
great,
and
the
battery
life
is
fantastic
highly
recommend
these
headphones
nice
quality
had
originally
bought
these
and
had
trouble
with
them
but
since
then
the
manufacturer
sent
out
replacement
earbuds
and
couldn't
be
happier
they
work
great
and
the
manufacturer
bent
over
backwards
to
make
it
right
they're
little
big
for
my
tiny
ears
but
most
headphones
are
for
me
anyway,
but
other
than
that
they're
awesome
not
much
noise
cancellation,
poor
battery
life
worst
experience
when
it
stopped
pairing
with
neither
laptop
nor
phone
after
using
it
for
around
months
really
like
these
for
car
and
outside
very
sturdy,well
madegreat
charging
base
easy
to
set
up
charging
system
works
well
and
good
quality
build
exactly
as
advertised
magnets
snap
the
buds
back
into
the
case
with
very
satisfying
feeling
come
ready
to
connect
out
of
the
box
great
battery
loved
them
at
first
but
within
month
or
two
they
became
very
quiet
and
unusable
they
haven't
had
any
damage
so
i'm
assuming
they're
just
cheap
product
the
product
sounds
is
very
bad
and
the
calls
keep
disconnect
for
the
price
compared
to
other
expensive
better
known
brands,
these
are
steal
the
quality
is
great
and
the
sound
gets
loud
with
good
base
gonna
have
to
get
another
pair
so
my
girl
won't
keep
asking
for
mine
the
product
exceeded
my
expectations
the
sound
qualify
is
amazing
the
fit
is
snug
the
product
is
so
lightweight
forget
i'm
wearing
them
just
music
and
listening
to
different
things
headphone
sound
quality
is
very
good,
clear
voice,
do
not
need
cumbersome
steps
to
connect
to
the
phone
the
point
is
the
sound
quality,
perfect
sound
quality
experience
tried
these
for
the
first
time
last
night
while
in
the
soccer
gym
canceled
out
sound
although
not
entirely
decent
quality,
liked
the
look
and
feel
of
them
really
enjoyed
these
really
worth
the
money
five
star
rating
for
over
all
comparison
sound
is
great
if
not
looking
for
bass
clear
stereo
sound
comparable
to
iphone
earbuds
or
better
can
go
wrong
amazing
little
product,
one
problem
was
that
after
while
the
left
earbud
became
louder
than
the
right
one
and
haven't
found
way
to
fix
it
other
than
that
it
was
amazing
with
the
great
sound
and
perfectly
water
resistant
great
headphones
but
the
noise
cancellation
does
need
some
improvement
also
maybe
after
the
first
few
link
ups
with
your
bluetooth
the
intro
can
get
annoying
the
package
is
beautiful
it
fits
pretty
well
on
my
ear
the
sound
is
pretty
good
too
it
looks
really
fashion
moved
around
while
wearing
it
and
it
doesn
fall
out
so
it
pretty
good
overall
like
this
product
so
far
really
like
the
battery
life,
and
how
quickly
they
charge
as
well
as
the
sound
quality
liked
how
easy
and
fast
they
were
to
connect
to
blue
tooth
the
sound
is
amazing
and
they
are
very
comfortable
in
my
ears
am
pleasantly
surprised
by
these
earbuds
the
sound
quality
is
outstanding
they
are
compact,
and
the
case
doubles
as
charging
dock
which
is
super
convenient
very
pleased
with
this
product
love
these
headphones
they
fit
perfectly
in
my
ear
and
it
connects
to
my
phone
very
quickly
don
have
to
worry
about
them
ever
not
being
charged
because
the
case
doubles
as
portable
battery
pack
headphones
came
fast
and
work
great
love
the
cute
little
accessory
bag
battery
life
is
more
than
enough
would
say
it
does
the
job
just
as
good
or
better
than
the
higher
end
expensive
ones
routinely
fails
to
pair
both
earbuds
making
them
effectively
worthless
instruction
manual
is
opaque
not
at
all
clear
how
to
correct
problem
they
disconnect
without
warning
all
the
time
the
cut
off
and
make
bizzing
noise
out
of
nowhere
hassle
free
charging
from
box
no
worries
on
whether
they
are
are
charged
plenty
of
charges
in
between
bought
this
february
they
worked
great
for
whilenow
the
sound
comes
and
goessometimes
loud
then
nothingit
fully
charged
and
use
them
once
weekso
after
months
need
to
find
new
ones
i'm
very
please
with
the
choice
of
this
product
the
setup
was
very
easy
plus
the
sound
quality
is
very
good
my
wife
and
both
purchased
one
and
we
would
recommend
this
product
to
our
friends
and
family
absolutely
love
these
earbuds
they
are
comfortable
to
wear,have
amazing
sound,
are
really
easy
to
use,
and
the
charge
lasts
for
long
time
max
battery
life
for
my
new
set
is
0/0
hours
no
bass
at
all
for
music
nothing
exceptional
at
all
here
very
mediocre
they
are
so
comfortable
for
all
day
use
the
connectivity
to
my
devices
is
great
well
worth
the
cost
and
would
recommend
to
friends
sound
is
ok
base
is
pretty
mediocre
the
battery
lasts
for
like
hours
which
is
disappointing,
but
the
case
keeps
charge
for
while
not
the
best
not
the
quality
was
looking
for
amazing
headphones
work
construction
and
ve
been
wearing
these
on
and
off
all
day
for
months
now
they
work
great
buying
pair
right
now
for
my
little
brother
when
we
train
muay
thai
love
them
i've
only
had
the
product
for
few
hours
so
can't
say
much
yet,
but
the
voice
is
atrocious
wife
likes
them
use
them
for
you
tube
and
podcast
ect
great
great
fit
and
sound
is
surprising
me
the
minute
you
put
both
pair
in
your
ears
,
you
feel
the
whole
world
are
quitting
down,
nothing
even
joking,
but
onething
is
not
really
good
about
this
product
is
kind
of
hurts
when
you
first
put
it
in
your
ears
but
you
will
get
use
to
it
soon
use
it
alot
referred
this
item
by
friend
great
product
only
used
it
myself
for
short
time
so
far,
but
the
headphones
seem
to
definitely
be
worth
the
listed
pricedon
have
any
real
complaints
about
them,
just
overall
very
happy
with
the
product
these
headphones
for
perfect
they
are
awesome
for
running
or
just
wearing
around
the
house
would
recommend
to
anyone
this
is
real
nice
bluetooth
earbuds
it
comes
with
box
for
you
to
store
them
at
when
you
are
not
using
it
it
also
serves
as
dock
for
you
to
charge
your
earbuds
it
fit
my
ears
perfect
and
have
good
sound
quality
excelente
dislisked
the
uneven
audio
within
the
left
earbud
looked
up
possible
solutions
but
unfortunately
it's
hardware
issue
would
not
recommended
issue
occurred
about
weeks
after
purchase
worked
just
liked
they
said
great
quality
for
the
price
they
fit
well
and
stay
in
place
had
the
product
for
wks
and
now
the
left
ear
bud
is
so
low
you
can
barely
hear
it
tried
to
raise
the
volume
but
it
says
it's
at
max
volume
want
my
money
back
use
these
all
the
time
and
like
how
they
stay
in
my
ears
the
battery
lasts
while
and
it
provides
great
sound
for
this
kind
fits
well
great
sound,
easy
to
use
and
hassle
free
quality
is
excellent
been
using
it
during
my
jogging
rounds
and
exercises
or
when
i'm
enjoying
the
tub
and
didn't
have
to
charge
for
too
long
highly
recommended
volume
can
better,
not
noiise
cancellation,
notice
sound
comes
and
goes
when
moving
eg
jogging
bought
the
product
to
listen
to
podcast
and
simular
material
they
worked
well
enough
at
the
start,
but
then
the
volume
lowered
all
the
way
and
now
won't
increase
they
are
now
useless
these
earbuds
are
great,
i'm
always
moving
around
while
on
the
phone
and
its
hard
to
be
heard
with
these
earbuds
my
conversations
go
smoothly,
can
be
heard
without
any
trouble
and
the
sound
is
awesome
good
did
not
stay
in
ear
while
active
rarely
review
items
but
really
wanted
to
say
that
like
this
earbuds
lot
and
the
sound
quality
is
really
good
when
had
problems
the
company
was
very
nice
and
provided
great
customer
service
really
recommend
these
earbuds
and
hope
you
enjoy
them
as
much
as
do
have
nice
day
fantastic
wireless
earbuds
was
looking
for
cheaper
alternatives
to
apple
airpods
and
these
fit
the
bill
perfectly
very
comfortable
in
your
ears
and
easy
to
pair
with
your
phone
highly
recommended
i've
purchased
two
pairs
of
these
like
the
fit
and
the
sound
is
excellent
the
battery
life
has
been
no
more
than
hours,
which
is
disappointing
overall,
i'm
enjoying
them
awesome
wireless
buds
actually
does
better
job
like
it
coz
they
fit
perfectly
on
my
ears
easy
to
connecti
think
it
better
product
at
that
price
two
of
my
purchases
had
defective
right
ear
bud
the
other
two
purchases
worked
amazing
and
we
are
content
with
all
sound
quality
the
earbuds
are
snug
in
your
ear,
staying
on
while
running
the
charging
case
is
helpful
as
don't
have
to
worry
about
my
earbuds
running
low
on
battery
during
workout
work
well
and
sound
good
battery
life
is
pretty
good
and
also
functions
well
as
headset
for
phone
calls
great
for
just
treble
music;
no
bass,
but
not
deal
breakerthey
stay
charged
for
good
while
and
case
rarely
needs
charging
control
using
the
earbud
touch
mode
is
too
confusing
use
primarily
to
listen
to
music
on
my
phone
they
stick
to
the
ears
very
well,
the
sound
quality
is
great
as
well
as
the
autonomy
moreover
find
them
very
confortable
finally,
this
is
nice
quality
over
price,
strongly
recommend
can
use
the
left
ear
bud
alone
out
of
the
case
but
cannot
use
the
right
side
alone
out
of
the
case
other
than
that
for
the
price
its
pretty
good
these
headphones
sound
good
and
stay
in
place
pretty
well
keeping
the
headphone
cords
out
of
the
way
will
be
great
for
my
job
and
getting
things
done
around
the
house
you
definitely
can
cancel
out
the
noises
of
the
world
with
these
and
love
the
comfort
of
the
fit
in
my
ears
they're
easy
to
handle
and
easy
to
transport
around
definitely
worth
the
price
and
love
it
these
are
comfortable
and
the
sound
quality
is
decent,
but
the
charge
doesn
last
long
fully
charged,
they
die
around
hrs
of
use
they're
ok
not
great,
not
terrible
sound
quality
is
lacking
and
the
touch
feature
is
sensitive
but
they
work
for
the
purpose
need
comfortable
to
wear
these
headphones
fit
incredibly
well
in
your
ears,
have
crystal
clear
sound,
and
you
don
feel
like
they
will
fall
out
if
you
bend
over
overall
these
are
great
and
look
forward
to
continuing
to
use
them
in
the
future
not
long
on
battery
otherwise
good
for
the
price
they
are
very
good
its
not
all
world
quality
but
they
get
the
job
doneand
the
customer
support
is
excellent
sound
is
great,
decently
soundproof
as
well
they
don't
fall
out
thanks
to
the
high
quality
nubs
that
hold
them
securely
in
your
ear
very
light
as
well,
you
hardly
notice
they
are
there
very
comfortable
to
wear,
sound
is
good
,
good
product
for
the
price
comes
with
very
nice
charging
case
although
the
sound
quality
is
good
and
some
other
things
are
great
but
didn't
really
like
the
case
it
was
so
huge
:
it
was
pretty
annoying
to
carry
that
kind
of
large
thing
in
my
pocket
one
side
has
quit
working
other
than
that,
they
were
good
hopefully
can
get
replacement
do
like
them
at
all
they
are
what
they
say
they
was
gone
to
be
trun
up
all
the
way
luck
to
hear
the
singer
this
suck
big
time
stopped
working
after
uses
the
seller
contacted
me
with
additional
instructions
and
offered
refund
when
working
enjoyed
the
product
they
worked
for
about
the
first
months
then
the
other
day
the
left
earbud
just
stopped
working
it
now
plays
at
about
0/0
of
the
volume
it
should
this
makes
them
unusable
the
earbuds
were
decent
while
they
were
working
they
died
within
year
of
purchase
and
will
no
longer
charge
will
not
repurchase
these
bluetooth
earbuds
worked
great
they
were
extremely
comfortable,
music
was
clear,
and
they
stayed
in
my
ear
i've
had
problems
in
the
past
with
earbuds
falling
out
but
these
stayed
in
and
didn't
hurt
my
ears
would
buy
again
touch
control
and
huge
battery
charging
box
caught
my
interest
am
worried
that
the
sound
will
be
very
bad
until
finally
hear
the
sound
the
sound
is
amazing
after
using
these
earbuds
for
one
month,
the
left
bud
stopped
working
tried
to
contact
the
company
but
they
never
responded
would
not
buy
again
liked
them
at
first,
but
the
right
piece
stopped
working
after
less
than
weeks
of
use
the
sound
quality
is
like
listening
to
something
in
another
room
consistent
pairing
issues
where
headphones
would
not
pair
with
each
other
they
are
also
subject
to
fair
amount
of
bluetooth
interference
when
going
through
certain
locations
uncomfortable
design
good
battery
both
case
and
earbuds,
bad
audio
null
bass
and
messy
pairing
when
using
only
the
right
one
it
gift
for
my
husband
and
he
is
completely
happy
about
it
tried
it
myself
and
satisfied
with
the
sound
quality
the
connection
is
stable
too
love
it
works
well
enough
it
would
just
disconnect
when
ever
it
wanted
to
so
you
would
have
to
pair
them
again
and
again
easy
to
connect,
reconnect
everytime
after
it
paired
sound
quality
is
good,
battery
last
0~0
hours
non
stop
playing
with
max
volume
overall
good
buy
best
wireless
headphones
ve
owned
sound
quality
is
great,
the
second
you
take
them
off
the
charging
station
they
connect
right
away
definitely
will
be
giving
as
gifts
this
holliday
season
these
headphones
are
great
much
better
than
expected
for
the
price
have
another
set
of
wireless
earbuds
that
spent
$0
on
and
the
sound
better
in
less
than
year
one
the
earbuds
stop
working
and
is
not
charging
anymore
the
right
one
has
barely
any
volume
earbuds
stay
in
your
eargreat
at
the
gymthey
stay
charged
for
days
with
the
charging
caselove
them
every
other
time,
the
headphones
fails
to
pair
it
often
takes
several
"put
back
into
the
case
and
take
it
back
out
again"
just
to
connect
to
my
android
phone
the
control
on
the
headset
is
also
flimsy,
often
pausing
the
music
instead
of
skipping
to
the
next
song
or
replay
don
know
if
received
defective
unit,
but
the
sound
quality
is
extremely
poor
no
mids
or
bass
was
not
dissatisfied
with
the
product
the
case
is
easy
to
use,
and
the
fact
that
it
is
charger
means
my
phone
can
stay
charged
as
well
the
automatic
pairing
is
great
the
best
wireless
earbuds
for
the
price
love
these
earbuds
fit
snuggly
in
my
ears
and
sound
quality
is
great
excellent
ear
buds
very
short
battery
life
use
these
for
the
gym,
and
they
are
excellent
also
work
great
with
calls
ordered
pair
my
boyfriend
also
lives
his
product
came
on
time
and
as
expected
highly
satisfied
this
is
actually
really
great
product,
good
sound
quality
too
others
are
saying
there
is
no
bass
but
am
not
having
this
issue
overall
am
very
happy
with
my
purchase
these
are
amazing
not
very
loud
and
lose
connection
all
the
time
really
like
these
earbuds
high
quality
product,
awesome
sound,
they
are
very
comfortable
what
is
very
important
for
me
because
actually
have
sore
from
other
earphones
also
very
easy
to
connect
with
phone
they
re
great
for
sound
have
problems
when
use
both,
the
right
earpiece
tends
to
cut
in
and
out
when
on
phone
call
the
other
end
hears
lot
of
background
noise
you
literally
can't
even
turn
your
head
away
from
your
phone
because
it
cuts
out
sooooooo
much
phone
call
quality
is
horrible
as
well
don't
recommend
the
ear
buds
are
easy
to
connect
to
your
phone
the
sound
is
great,
very
clear
they
fit
perfectly
into
the
ear
without
any
discomfort
this
is
nice
product
good
sound,
very
comfortable
seamless
connection
good
for
the
price
after
month
of
using
them,
they
just
stopped
working
for
about
week,
but
randomly
started
to
work
again,
so
not
sure
what
was
up
with
that
hopefully
they
stay
working
got
these
headphones
to
kinda
hide
while
im
at
work
and
they
work
perfectly
they
hardly
show
and
they
cancel
noise
perfectly
and
the
battery
life
is
very
good
would
recomend
great
ear
buds
this
ear
buds
does
far
more
than
its
price
one
thing
that
would
point
out
is
that
the
plug
doesn't
really
fit
the
ear
hole
other
then
that,
this
is
amazing
love
these
ear
buds
charges
them
in
the
case
and
can
charge
my
phone
to
fast
recharge
too
awesome
product
love
them
sound
quality
is
excellent
these
are
definitely
worth
buying
ran
into
some
slight
issues
such
as
one
earbug
constantly
cutting
out
but
was
easily
fixed
by
resetting
them
really
like
the
feel
of
it
in
my
ears
the
bass
effect
makes
big
difference
the
battery
case
it
an
added
bonus
love
the
sound
quality
and
battery
life
the
charging
case
comes
inhandy
quite
bit
good
ear
buds;
sounds
quality
is
about
what
would
expect,
earbuds
fit
well
and
are
comfortable
haven
worn
them
in
rain
or
anyplace
to
test
waterproofing,
but
they
seem
like
they
would
hold
up
these
headphones
were
great
at
first
but
quickly
decreased
in
sound
volume
after
the
first
months
now
at
highest
setting
it
barely
any
sound
at
all
bad
quality
the
sound
quality
is
not
the
greatest
this
is
great
product
sound
is
good
and
so
far
the
quality
seems
good
as
well
it's
pretty
effective
noise
cancellation
especially
if
music
is
playing
the
are
def
higher
quality
than
$0
will
normally
get
you
buy
these
got
this
item
exchanged
it
for
replacement
set
for
sound
quality
and
the
same
issue
happened
horrible
won
stay
connected
will
disconnect
mid
call
total
painful
experience

don
recommend
these
are
like
the
papa
johns
of
airpods
style
hearing
aids
this
bops
and
leaves
you
like
summer
day
at
the
beach,
sweaty
and
wet
0/0
love
the
headphones
the
sound
quality
is
great
when
listening
to
podcasts
and
very
good
on
the
phone
intuitive
to
use
and
very
comfortable
fit
awesome
product
great
product
it's
not
that
loud
and
the
battery
life
is
less
than
hours
but
it
does
do
great
job
cancelling
out
noise
sound
is
eh
great
for
the
gym
except
they
keep
falling
out
of
my
ears
but
great
product
otherwise
very
easy
to
use
and
connect
have
used
them
with
my
laptop
and
fitbit
the
sound
is
good
and
they
really
don't
fall
out
when
running
these
earbuds
work
perfectly
the
battery
life
and
sound
quality
are
great
they
are
perfect
for
running
or
talking
on
the
phone
easy
to
connect
and
use
love
everything
about
it
the
case
is
the
best
part,
the
right
headphone
cuts
in
and
out
all
the
time
it
gets
annoying
started
just
putting
the
left
one
in
and
leaving
the
right
one
in
the
case
this
product
is
amazingthe
earbuds
worked
out
of
the
box
use
them
while
taking
my
walks
can
still
here
noises
outside
but
can
hear
my
music
without
disturbing
others
love
them
sound
is
really
good
not
all
full
volume
it
already
is
fairly
loud
the
charging
case
is
very
useful
for
holding
them
and
charging
my
phone
when
needed
overall
i'm
satisfied
works
perfect
and
good
price
great
headphones
were
ok,
not
much
bass
even
with
bass
boost
turned
on
for
iphone
fit
in
ear
nice
with
many
different
options
can't
give
more
than
star
to
product
that
broke
after
only
two
months
the
right
earbud
stopped
working
very
disappointed
love
it
they
worked
fine
for
about
month
then
one
stopped
working
and
neither
work
bought
pair
at
the
same
time
and
the
other
pair
has
the
same
problem
we
got
these
earbuds
for
my
brother
and
he
is
in
love
with
them
uses
them
everyday
and
hasn
complained
about
them
once
this
is
one
of
his
most
used
birthday
presents
yet
oving
these
new
headphones
they
fit
comfortably
in
my
ear
and
cancels
out
noise
very
well
the
touch
controls
are
really
cool
and
have
great
sound
quality
also
love
they
are
waterproof
and
am
really
enjoying
the
charging
case
highly
recommend
these
work
pretty
fantastically
easy
to
set
up
and
use
and
they
sound
pretty
good
too
would
definitely
recommend
these
if
you
re
looking
for
some
good
earbuds
on
budget
they
work
good
for
about
month
but
ve
gotten
pair
and
they
both
start
cutting
out
after
that
have
been
using
this
product
for
month
or
and
there
is
no
base
and
one
of
the
ear
right
pieces
works
intermittently
the
product
was
easy
to
pair,
looks
and
fit
great,
but
the
touch
was
too
sensitive
if
touched
the
earpiece
at
all
during
call
it
would
hang
up
my
only
complaint
tried
numerous
times
to
be
extra
careful
and
every
time
it
would
hang
up
yes
it
is
the
second
time
bought
them
this
time
bought
for
my
brother
the
quality
is
very
good
love
them
use
hem
every
time
work
out,
do
functional
fitness
so
these
ear
buds
stay
in
with
no
problems
returning
ppl
on
the
other
side
saying
to
much
noise
and
hard
to
hear
sorry
product
sounded
nice
when
first
opened
them
few
hours
later
they
decreased
in
volume
significantly,
they
also
have
trouble
connecting
to
my
phone
the
sound
was
loud
and
clear,
very
good
strero,
as
am
not
of
bass
head
feel
that
the
bass
and
treble
are
of
average
quality
very
light,
can't
really
feel
it
when
wearing
love
how
comfortable
these
headphones
while
working
out
also
did
not
not
expect
such
great
range
across
different
music
genre
would
recommend
worked
right
out
of
the
box
battery
life
is
great
do
lose
paring
on
the
pair
if
only
one
is
used
initially
absolutely
love
the
design,
compact
design
and
easy
pairing
would
definitely
recommend
this
product
for
the
price,
the
sound
quality
was
horrible,
had
them
full
blast
at
the
gym
and
could
literally
hear
people
having
conversations,
no
noise
cancellation
what
so
ever
returning
the
product
and
super
bummed
have
to
pay
$0
to
ship
the
product
back
very
unsatisfied
wasn
what
said
these
headphones
are
okay
they
stick
pretty
far
out
of
your
ears
and
look
goofy
the
sound
and
quality
is
okay
but
sometimes
it
takes
forever
for
them
to
connect
to
the
bluetooth
these
'true
wireless'
earbuds
have
nice
balanced
sound
and
are
very
simple
to
use
for
the
money,
very
nice
true
wireless
earbuds
use
these
for
running
and
love
them
ve
had
them
for
over
month
and
never
even
charged
the
case
yet
just
put
the
earbuds
back
in
it
after
every
run
and
they
are
ready
to
go
easy
to
use
and
great
sound
returned
like
the
buld
and
feature
this
divice
has
but
have
to
be
honest,
the
audio
is
not
all
that
great
was
little
upset
but
still
very
effective
of
canceling
out
everything
else
if
you
do
little
more
research
i'm
sure
you'll
find
something
worth
your
money
if
not
this
is
not
bad
alternative
absolutely
zero
bass
or
mids,
even
after
changing
the
equalizer
junk
they
always
sync
up
and
they
never
cut
out
these
things
work
great
sound
is
better
than
the
enacfire
set
had
plus
the
portable
charger
is
way
more
useful
might
just
get
another
pair
for
my
wife
good
battery
life
good
sound
quality
comes
with
sets
of
different
size
replaceable
ear
buds
charges
pretty
quick
this
product
was
what
was
expecting
love
that
can
connect
my
phone
to
the
battery
to
charge
it
and
long
battery
life
for
the
head
phone
is
plus
recommend
buying
also
great
price
for
the
product
great
product
can
use
them
in
the
shower
with
no
issues
battery
life
sucks
though
only
lasts
long
enough
for
hour
workouti
will
be
buying
second
set
of
headphones
to
use
while
the
other
is
charging
just
got
these,
and
on
full
charge
the
first
time
out
they
only
lasted
hours
playing
music
the
sound
quality
is
the
worst
i've
experienced
on
any
headphones
i've
ever
owned
no
clue
why
these
are
getting
such
solid
reviews
they
are
truly
awefuldo
not
buy
perfect
earphone
never
though
it
would
be
so
good
this
earphone
is
as
smart
and
fancy
as
airpods,
but
much
cheaper
than
it
love
it
very
much
great
for
listening
to
music
and
audiobooks
great
sound
easy
to
pause
and
play
again
with
quick
tap
would
buy
again
:
love
these
headphones
they
stay
in
when
run,
life
weights
or
use
the
machines
at
the
gym
they
have
great
sound
no
complaints
so
far
great
set
of
bluetooth
earbuds
for
my
office
exactly
what
was
looking
for
once
figured
out
how
to
pair
with
my
macbook,
we
were
good
to
go
happy
with
them
run
so
tend
to
touch
my
hat
and
inadvertently
touch
the
earbuds
they
re
so
sensitive
that
it
pauses
musicotherwise
solid
solution
for
wireless
especially
if
you
re
active
great
for
headbanging
to
some
godsmacki'll
let
you
know
battery
life
and
phone
case
charger
thingygreat
bass
for
lil
wayne
music
is
good
love
the
charging
case
am
giving
three
stars
because
whenever
my
phone
is
inside
my
pocket
the
sound
in
the
earphones
starts
to
fail
other
than
that,
the
sound
and
battery
life
are
good
sent
these
back
immediately
because
of
the
terrible
sound
quality
the
other
reviews
are
correct
that
there
is
no
bass,
all
high
treble
that
verges
on
hurting
your
ears
gave
it
stars
only
because
it
does
pair
with
the
phone
and
function
they
are
awesome
the
way
they
are
put
together
feels
quality
sound
is
excellent
&
clear
connectivity
is
breeze
also
the
battery
life
is
good
would
recommend
these
to
anyone
looking
for
pair
enjoy
it
didn't
take
two
months
to
break,
the
left
ear
often
didn't
hear
the
sound,
and
the
sound
was
too
small
liked
this
product
for
several
reasons
it
is
great
for
the
price
and
it
works
without
any
problems
most
headphones
would
die
really
quick
but
this
one
doesn't
mi
pedido

muy
conforme
muchas
gracias
this
product
is
excellent,
it
sits
in
the
ear
perfectly
and
has
great
sound
quality,
recommend
this
product
to
anyone
looking
for
new
pair
of
earbuds/headphones
the
headphones
are
great
deal
for
the
price
they
fit
comfortably
and
the
sound
quality
is
great
highly
recommend
if
anyone
is
looking
for
wireless
earbud
headphones
great
quality
sound,
independent
use
of
both
earbuds,
amazing
battery
life,
and
it
doubles
as
charging
bank
for
your
phone
these
are
some
of
the
best
bluetooth
earbuds
you
can
get
nice
quality,
wish
battery
life
was
little
longer,
it's
easily
parable
with
any
device
can
not
be
used
for
calls,
therefore
was
little
bit
disappointed
also
you
can
use
them
one
at
time
love
that
it
blocks
out
all
exterior
noice
and
the
quality
of
sound
is
excellent
like
it
because
it
exactly
how
they
describe
it
to
be
and
love
it
the
sound
is
good
and
for
calls
as
well
and
it
just
all
around
real
good
will
most
likely
order
more
received
my
ear
buds
and
they
work
great,
love
that
could
wear
them
wireless
and
they
fit
better
than
the
headphones
get
with
my
iphone
the
best
part
is
that
put
them
on
and
don
have
to
listen
to
everyone
drama
at
work
like
that
there
loud
and
comfortable
to
wear
plus
you
can
use
one
at
time
as
wellmy
dislikes
are
that
there
not
made
for
calling
but
other
then
that
it's
good
accidentally
left
my
earbud
in
my
pant
pocket
and
it
got
washed,
knew
it
was
water
resistant
but
didn't
expect
that
much
wow
super
surprised
by
this
product
very
good
for
the
price
i've
been
using
it
for
three
days
the
sound
quality
is
very
good
in
this
price
that
is
exactly
what
need
gave
this
stars
because
wish
that
the
play/pause
touchpad
on
the
earbud
was
button
so
that
if
your
hair
was
wet
it
didn't
keep
pausing
and
bringing
up
google
assistant
the
earbuds
worked
perfect
for
months
after
months
one
side
will
not
work
not
worth
months
of
use
had
this
product
for
three
months
it
was
great
until
the
right
earbud
went
to
out
such
shame
since
it
had
good
battery
life
and
the
sound
was
nice
they
are
waterproof
which
is
big
plus
no
problems
setting
them
up
and
getting
them
to
connect
to
the
computer
and
the
charging
case
works
well
too
so
far
the
sound
has
been
fantastic
and
seems
like
you
are
at
concert
very
easy
to
use
and
battery
life
last
good
long
time
best
ear
bub
purchase
so
far
for
the
price
this
is
great
product
have
only
had
these
for
few
weeks
now
but
am
so
pleased
with
the
quality
so
far
they
are
great
an
excellent
choice
for
budget
minded
individuals
excellent
comfort
with
good
inear
stability
really
like
these
they
sound
good
and
battery
last
pretty
long
for
my
use
change
the
rubber
ear
piece
for
my
comfort
other
than
that
these
are
great
excellent
cheap,
but
you
get
what
you
pay
for
these
stopped
working
after
months
the
right
earbud
stopped
connecting
don't
waste
your
time
here,
go
buy
ipods
bought
it
as
gift
and
works
great
first
day
receiving
this
product
they
cut
out
the
whole
time
when
it
wasn
cutting
out
the
sound
was
decent
but
way
to
much
cutting
out
excellent
for
the
price,already
buy
the
third
one
to
my
family
know
why
sell
lot
earbuds
will
buy
again
thank
you
awesome
product
just
lacks
really
any
base
or
clear
treble
good
for
podcasts
stuff,
but
if
ur
wanting
to
hear
music
clearly
not
the
ones
id
choose
they're
like
ear
plugs
that
blast
your
favorite
jams
can't
hear
anything
else
going
on
around
me
unless
want
to
they're
amazing
and
i'll
probably
buy
some
for
my
husband
too
they
are
fine
if
you
want
earbuds
that
fall
out
of
your
ear
constantly
and
pause
with
the
mere
grazing
of
an
earbud
lasted
for
about
months
before
the
tiny
circular
covering
came
off
in
my
ear,
which
couldn't
get
out
for
week
after
less
than
six
months
the
earbuds
lost
volume
the
volume
is
controlled
through
the
phone
,
but
even
at
it's
highest
level,
the
sound
is
very
low
great
product
easy
to
usepaired
easily
with
my
iphone
and
ipad
surprised
how
far
can
walk
away
from
my
device
and
they
are
still
so
clear
love
them
bought
these
few
months
ago
battery
life
is
great
sound
and
quality
are
good
for
the
price
great
value
here
shockingly
great
quality
love
the
fit,
lots
of
different
tips
so
you
can
fit
them
just
right
can
even
charge
your
phone
with
the
battery
box
the
only
negative
have
is
that
the
base
is
not
great
really
good
for
the
money
nonot
as
good
as
popular
brand
for
three
times
the
cost
overall
like
them
very
much
amazing
ear
phones,
they
are
waterproof
and
sounds
great
amazing
product
and
even
customer
service
is
superb
highly
recommended
these
earbuds
are
horrible
with
talking
they're
horrible
with
stay
in
your
ear
that
falls
out
because
they
are
topheavy
they
also
cut
in
and
out
to
pair
with
your
phone
out
of
also
you
can
turn
off
your
earbuds
without
the
case
it
comes
in
to
charge
it's
just
horrible
product
these
earbuds
were
purchased
so
could
take
with
me
to
the
gym
and
they
work
well
don
hear
any
noise
aside
from
the
music
listen
to
and
am
very
content
with
the
product
they
wouldn't
connect
just
gave
up
and
took
the
money
as
loss
great
noise
cancelling
and
good
sound
quality
great
value
for
the
money
like
how
can
wear
one
earpiece
and
still
have
total
control
work
in
warehouse
so
only
wearing
one
allows
me
to
still
great
my
music
and
my
surroundings
great
sound
with
long
life
love
thesethey're
perfect
for
gymbattery
life
is
awesome
and
accidentally
washed
them
with
my
uniform
and
they
are
still
working
perfectly
fine
these
earbuds
are
amazing
quality
for
an
amazing
price
they
have
great
sound
quality
and
are
very
comfortable
hard
to
turn
on
and
off,
hard
to
sync,
wish
wouldn't
have
waited
so
long
to
try
them
out
totally
missed
my
return
date
and
after
few
uses
ditched
them
and
bought
myself
plantronics
voyager
now
they
just
sit
collecting
dust
in
my
room
finally
pair
of
affordable
bluetooth
headphones
that
work
and
stay
in
my
ears
now
time
will
tell
how
long
they
will
last
sounds
great
battery
life
is
great
overall
excellent
my
husband
uses
them
for
work
and
has
no
complaintsimagine
that:
audio
cuts
in
and
out
every
min
or
so
even
when
fully
charged
device
is
constantly
dropping
connection
and
reconnecting
to
my
phone
bluetooth
connection
is
even
worse
when
my
phone
is
in
my
pocket,
cutting
out
every
seconds
or
so
very
disappointed
worked
for
few
months
then
the
sound
will
only
work
on
one
ear
terrible
tried
to
reset
multiple
times
and
no
luck
save
your
money
and
don
buy
this
sound
quality
is
pretty
damn
good
pleasantly
surprised
and
they
fit
well
in
my
ears
pairing
was
easy
very
happy
so
far
with
this
purchase
will
update
if
anything
changes
really
liked
the
size
of
the
buds
and
set
up
was
pretty
easy
buying
another
pair
for
my
teenage
sonsecond
pair
works
fine
but
one
ear
bud
stopped
working
on
the
first
pair
love
this
product
the
battery
life
is
great
along
with
the
case
being
charger
for
my
phone
makes
it
even
better
sound
is
great,
especially
if
you
only
want
to
use
one
ear
bud
waste
of
money
and
time
buds
doesn't
work
in
the
gym
ao
while
walking/running
this
product
is
highly
recommended
the
price
is
excellent
and
the
sound
quality
is
perfect
the
pairing
was
super
easy
like
them
they
have
good
battery
life
could
be
longer
but
they're
great
for
there
price
also
like
for
more
bass
but
thats
just
my
taste
compramos
el
producto
el
de
septiembre
ayer
de
noviembre
dejó
de
funcionar
es
una
verdadera
estafa,
no
lo
compren,
no
lo
recomiendo
they
fit
perfectly
in
your
ears
very
light
weight
they
only
took
about
seconds
to
set
up
to
my
phone
great
buy
for
the
cost
very
easy
setup,
love
that
there
are
different
sizes
for
ear
pieces,
and
sound
great
only
use
for
music
though
not
for
phone
use
these
are
fantastic
long
battery
life
and
great
sound
has
some
connection
issues
once
in
awhile
but
all
in
all
no
complaints
great
product
they
re
ok
use
them
while
running
and
they
re
comfortable,
but
don
sound
the
best
nor
do
they
isolate
well
perfect
in
everything,
really
recommend
bought
another
bluetooth
fone
cheaper
than
this
but
isn't
worth
it
just
buy
it
me
ha
pasado
que
cuando
me
quito
uno
vuelvo
conectarlo
se
deja
de
escuchar
hasta
que
lo
coloco
en
su
base,
lo
que
me
paso
ahora
es
que
no
se

solamente
se
esucha

these
headphones
are
very
good
for
the
price
easy
to
use,
comfortable
to
wear,
and
awesome
sound
customer
support
is
very
quick
to
respond
if
you
have
any
questions
and
fixed
my
problem
very
promptly
the
earphones
never
paired
together
so
that
could
listen
in
stereo
wish
had
never
wasted
my
money
on
them
gave
them
away
son

desonido
left
ear
every
time
after
hour
of
use,
it
begins
not
connecting
correctly
or,
just
stop
working
they
being
to
cut
out
not
really
fun
but
irritating
when
working
or
working
out
not
really
that
bad
for
the
price
compared
to
others
left
ear
bug
lost
sound
after
months

use
love
this
ear
buds~
you
can
actually
control
the
volume
and
other
functions
of
them
by
simple
tapping
them
and
unlike
other
earbuds
they
are
comfortable
don't
hurt
my
ears
worked
well
for
about
month
then
the
left
ear
bud
for
some
reason
started
only
giving
out
half
the
volume
of
the
right
one
it's
very
annoying
because
now
the
right
one
is
blaring
and
the
left
is
super
quiet
one
of
the
earbuds
volume
is
now
half
of
the
other
after
less
than
hours
of
useupdate:
great
customer
service,
handled
the
issue
with
the
product
auto
sync
good
product
with
great
price
worked
well
for
little
bit
the
sound
quality
was
acceptable
however,
after
about
months
the
volume
was
so
quiet,
the
earbuds
are
unusable
other
reviews
not
the
same
issue
you
can
do
better
for
the
price
these
headphones
are
great
always
struggled
finding
headphones
that
fit
my
ears
but
these
fit
perfectly
they
are
very
comfortable
and
have
great
sound
quality
the
battery
life
is
pretty
good
also
very
easy
to
pair
and
use;
earbuds
fit
comfortably;
excellent
sound
quality
for
music;
long
battery
life;
the
charging
station
is
also
portable
charger,
great
design
overall
good
price
for
good
quality
product
great
earbud
for
talk
radio
sounds
great
not
for
music
can't
get
loud
enough,
very
good
sound
quality
though
sound
quality
terrible
it's
like
having
pair
of
tweeters
in
your
ears
no
bass
whatsoever
this
is
good
product
clean
and
loud
sounds,
able
to
charge
your
phone
as
well
all
in
one
charger
would
reamend
this
product
work
great
bought
them
for
mowing
my
lawn
great
sound
even
iver
the
mower
bought
these
for
my
wife
and
she
loves
the
style
the
case
also
has
sleek
design
ear
bud
sound
quality
is
as
good
as
any
wired
ear
buds
and
more
comfortable
than
the
apple
ones
that
come
with
iphones
very
easy
and
convenient
to
use
good
for
podcasts
for
music
they
lack
bass
and
are
little
thin
sounding
but
overall
being
wireless
is
great
especially
for
working
out
so
happy
with
my
purchase
it
took
couple
tries
to
sync
the
left
ear,
but
when
it
connected,
everything
worked
perfectly
too
much
background
noise
and
uncomfortable
in
the
earlobes
got
exactly
what
expected
and
don't
have
any
issues
with
the
massive
clout
increasecharges
real
quick
hour
an
bit
your
ready
to
go
feel
that
this
headset
is
really
great,
it
just
the
right
size
for
me
and
the
sound
is
clear
these
wireless
earbuds
have
good
sound
and
do
function
as
advertised
good
for
your
daily
workout
but
to
much
background
noise
gets
in
to
use
while
mowing
your
lawn
great
price,
easy
to
use
sounds
great
haven't
had
pair
of
ear
buds
fit
in
my
ears
for
long
time,
but
these
fit
well
and
are
very
comfortable
these
are
the
best
earbuds
i've
tried
so
far
reccomend
them
bluetooth
on
these
works
better
than
that
of
other
similarly
priced
earbuds
has
great
bass
can
use
the
right
headphone
by
itself
recently
got
these
earbuds
and
am
very
pleased
with
them
gave
this
product
star
they
were
excellent
in
the
beginning
and
have
slowly
stopped
working
they
are
only
month
old
and
unfortunately
it
too
late
to
return
them
poor
product
nice
device
satisfied
nice
pair
of
wireless
waterproof
earphones
appreciate
the
quality
of
the
product
so
far
just
question
the
audio
balancing
between
the
two
earphones
my
left
earphone
is
usually
more
quiet
than
my
right
and
don't
know
why
awesome
product
good
ear
buds
&
charger
great
thing
for
working
out
&
walking
dogs
these
wireless
earbuds
are
comfortable
to
wear
and
the
sound
quality
is
amazing
highly
recommend
purchasing
this
product
very
tinny
sound
quality
and
horrible
connectivity
issues
tried
on
iphone
and
samsung
s0
certainly
not
worth
the
price
and
regret
to
say
that
i'm
going
back
to
my
wired
earbuds
very
easy
to
use,
and
set
up
they
don
fall
out
of
your
ears
when
performing
various
activities
the
sound
quality
is
very
good
as
well
and
the
touch
controls
are
simple
and
respond
quickly
to
each
touch
great
price,

fit

they
stay
in
ear
work

love
the
product

well
into
my

decent
bluetooth
ear

they
are
perfect
for
it

product
came

these
worked
great
for
months,
but
recently
the

great
product,
exactly
what
expected
to
receive
and
very
happy
with
the
overall
performance,
battery
life,
and
case
it
comes
with
sleek,
light
to
wear,
and
awesome
sound
they
were
decent
headphones
at
first
but
then
they
stopped
pairing
together
you
get
what
you
pay
for
works
as
advertised
but
the
touch
for
turning
off
is
very
sensitive
&
turns
off
too
easily
if
you
like
the
sound
to
come
into
your
ears
with
no
bass
and
all
treble
this
is
the
product
for
you
these
earphones
are
extremely
comfortable,
and
have
warm
sound
all
types
of
music
sound
great
through
them
definitely
worth
the
price
don't
waste
your
money

but
won't
play
anything

initially
really
liked
these
but
the
sound
is
so
low

stopped
connecting
to
anything
within
months
of

and
value
are
there
would
recommend
love
the
earbuds
the
sound
quality
is
fantastic,
the
noise
cancellation
is
great,
and
the
battery
life
is
probably
my
favorite
thing
extremely
recommend
the
pods
last
for
around
to
hours
but
the
charging
case
lasts
for
about
week
the
only
con
can
think
of
is
the
mic,
most
times
people
wont
be
able
to
hear
you
great
wireless
earbuds
comfortable
and
great
sound
quality
probably
gonna
get
more
for
the
family
like
that
they
noise
cancelling
can
cut
the
yard
or
go
workout
and
don't
have
to
worry
about
them
coming
out
the
ear
buds
work
great
maine
has
just
become
hands
free
state,
so
the
purchase
was
the
right
thing
to
do
thank
you
returned
the
product
the
earbuds
didn
pair
with
each
other
occasional
latency
this
is
good
product
if
you
don
want
to
spend
fortune
on
airpods
these
wireless
earbuds
are
perfect
for
my
runs
they
sound
great,
are
comfortable,
stay
in,
and
have
long
battery
life
could
last
longer
battery
wise
sounds
great
except
few
cut
outs
noise
cancelling
is
great
but
still
could
better
slip
outta
ear
love
these
for
the
gym
no
cords
to
worry
about
getting
caught
in
they
stay
in
place
while
running
fue
un
gasto
perdido
no
sueñas
los
auriculares
solo
uno
estoy
decepcionada
de
ver
gastado
en
algo
no
sirve
i've
tried
several
wireless
earbuds
and
these
have
been
the
best
no
cutting
out,
noise
cancelling
very
happy
so
comfortable
and
love
all
the
different
rubber
tips
for
comfort
pair
easily
and
fit
perfectly
love
the
product
recommend
bought
these
earbuds
for
my
husband
he
uses
these
when
he
runs
he
says
these
are
fantastic
and
work
great
will
purchase
again
for
my
sons,
as
they
are
way
cheaper
than
apple
and
work
well
excellent
sound
quality,
bluetooth
range,
and
battery
life
planning
to
purchase
another
set
for
my
girlfriend
very
nice
but
to
talk
on
the
phone
is
no
good
best
wireless
ear
buds
i've
used
primarily
use
them
for
hands
free
calling
in
the
car
great
sound
quality
and
noise
cancelation
my
only
complaint
would
be
the
battery
life
after
hours
of
play
time,
the
earbuds
start
to
lose
life
so,
make
sure
you
carry
the
charging
case
with
you
as
well
loved
the
battery,
its
long
lasting
and
the
size
of
the
earbuds
is
perfect
they
are
very
confortable
to
wear
and
the
quality
of
the
sound
is
great
excellent
sound
quality,
very
durable
and
use
them
often
while
working
out
or
watching
youtube
videos
at
work
am
by
far
so
pleased
with
these
did
read
ton
of
reviews
who
felt
the
same
way
before
bought
them
and
am
so
happy
did
they
are
awesome,
my
husband
loves
them
main
reason
for
purchasing
was
for
being
sweatproof
have
run
with
them
on
very
hot
days
and
they
have
hold
with
my
sweat
sound
quality
was
good
they
work
great
shower
with
them
np
they
dont
have
any
bass
dont
really
like
the
bass
personally
but
for
some
know
that's
downside
after
week
of
use
volume
drastically
decreased
to
where
you
could
not
barely
hear
it
only
thing
didn
really
like
was
the
battery
life
it
usually
lasts
about
to
hours
but
other
than
that
they
re
pretty
decent
one
earbud
stopped
working
after
only
days
purchased
these
for
traveling
they
work
well
with
my
iphone
and
are
good
fit
use
it
at
work
and
it
was
plus
for
me
don't
have
to
worry
about
carrying
around
charger
all
day
great
headphones
so
farfor
the
price
music
quality
cant
be
beatbluetooth
connectivity
has
not
been
an
issuei
recommend
especially
for
price
bought
these
for
my
boyfriend
because
he
has
small
ears
he
said
they
fit
nicely
in
his
ear
and
has
good
bass
they
don
fall
out
when
he
moves
around
this
product
was
amazing
from
the
great
deal
to
the
actually
awesome
use
of
his
product
these
earbuds
are
more
than
what
you
pay
for
right
ear
bud
stopped
working
in
less
than
month
too
late
to
return
otherwise
good
product
this
product
is
better
then
thought
it
would
be
they
don't
fall
out
and
the
battery
has
good
life
span
would
buy
them
again
for
sure
these
headphones
are
great
value
good
connectivity
and
suction
into
your
ear
so
they
don't
fall
out
best
of
all,
they
sound
great
even
while
running
they
didnt
even
last
two
months
left
ear
just
completely
goes
dead
even
with
it
being
fully
charged
cant
even
return
because
the
window
for
return
was
only
month
am
completely
dissatisfied
with
this
product
spent
hours
getting
rubber
pad
from
the
left
ear
bud
out
of
my
ear
canal,
since
the
people
who
made
this
piece
of
junk
shaped
them
in
way
that
they
were
destined
to
get
stuck
sound
quality
isn't
bad
but
this
thing
getting
stuck
in
my
ear
makes
this
product
utter
trash
the
product
is
simple
to
charge
and
works
really
well
bluetooth
connects
very
fast
and
the
sound
quality
is
good
am
satisfied
with
the
product
ve
only
had
these
earbuds
for
few
days
now,
but
everything
is
working
great
so
far
this
product
sucks
if
you
are
not
holding
your
phone
at
all
times
bought
it
for
workout
and
it
skips
all
the
time
if
put
it
in
my
pocket
if
hold
it
out
it
is
ok
but
what's
the
point
great
product,
nice
company
to
work
with
these
earbuds
sound
great,
with
just
enough
bassthey
paired
easilythey
also
broke
after
month
bought
the
product
based
on
good
rating
and
reviews
but
this
is
pc
of
junk
it
disconnects
so
often
even
when
am
right
next
to
it
wish
had
not
wasted
my
$0
the
sound
in
the
left
earbud
stopped
working
altogether
sound
quality
is
not
as
good
as
thought
need
replacement
love
that
you
have
choice
to
listen
to
just
one
instead
of
both
good
the
sound
on
these
earbuds
is
very
good
for
the
price
to
top
it
off,
the
customer
support
was
flawless
responded
within
minutes
and
provided
me
with
video's
when
could
not
sync
both
earbuds
the
controls
work
well
you
can
pause,
play,
skip,
activate
siri,
and
change
the
volume
this
is
uncommon
on
similarly
priced
headphones
wish
they
had
better
bass
but
they
really
cancelled
noisy
rooms
well
battery
lasts
long
time
as
long
as
you
are
using
it
only
to
charge
headphones
love
this
product
lost
the
right
piece,
but
since
the
warranty
insured
the
headphones
they
were
able
to
send
me
replacement,
the
response
on
the
email
was
timely
and
nice
the
sound
quality
is
good
and
the
touch
functionality
is
really
nice
and
convenient
love
these
earbuds
their
loud,lasting,
and
durable
only
one
earbud
would
link
to
the
bluetooth
at
time
both
of
them
links,
but
not
together
so
you
can
only
use
one
earbud
so
disappointed
the
psaonomi
buds
are
easier
to
pair
than
other
earbuds
have
used
the
sound
quality
is
good
and
the
pasonomi
company
is
very
responsive
if
there
is
problem
these
wireless
headphones
are
excellent
the
sound
is
great
and
they
fit
really
well
at
the
gym
highly
recommend
initial
pair
that
we
received
stopped
working
within
couple
of
months
unable
to
hold
charge
however,
the
supplier
sent
replacement
pair
that
work
effectively,
as
advertised
supplier
was
apologetic
and
eager
to
correct
the
problem
great
product
for
the
price
all
around
convenient
features
and
solid
choice
if
you're
looking
for
true
wireless
earbuds
without
breaking
your
wallet
perfect
product
have
using
this
earphone
for
over
month
and
the
the
quality
of
your
phone
is
amazing
it
was
have
great
sound
when
you
use
it
it
is
one
of
the
best
earphones
ever
used
works
really
well
sometimes
the
sound
drops
off
one
headphone
worked
excellent
for
about
weeks
now
battery
life
barely
lasts
0hrs,
product
randomly
cuts
off
and
restarts
in
middle
of
phone
calls,
unreliable
mic
pickup
and
volume
love
that
you
can
charge
your
phone
with
the
casethe
bass
is
good
and
the
sound
quality
is
perfect
for
me
they
fit
in
my
ear
perfect
worst
earphones
ever
the
earbuds
are
very
worth
it
for
the
price
the
sound
quality,
battery
life,
and
design
are
very
good
and
don
regret
spending
$0
quality

is
good

on
place
hard
to

my
wife

barely
audible
on
that

and
often
not

the
sound

an
amazing
battery
length
highly
recommended
easy
to
use,
good
sound
for
$0
say
this
product
is
pretty
good
but
not
the
best,
after
while
the
sound
starts
to
cut
off
and
it
harder
to
sync
good
quality
and
easy
to
use
love
them

actually
surprised
at
how
well
the
noise
cancellation
worked
definitely
happy
with
my
purchase
the
earphones
very
good
and
comfortable
they
don
irritate
my
ears
like
others
highly
recommend
these
failed
after
weeks
received
my
earbuds,
however
they
don
work
properly
from
the
day
received
themonly
the
right
earbud
works
when
synced
to
my
phone
they
do
not
work
together
st
all
good
price
never
expected
these
to
be
noise
cancelling
headphones,
so
that's
why
stars
on
noise
cancelling
they're
nice
headphones
second
pair
in
monthshaven
had
any
luck
with
them
pairing
together
&
batteries
went
bad
on
first
pair
after
days
give
or
take
to
be
honest
the
sound
isn
that
great
with
these
earpods
ve
also
been
having
problems
with
them
staying
in
my
ears
as
well
from
previous
reviews
assumed
these
were
the
best
offered
but
guess
was
mistaken
good
fit
in
my
ears,
decent
sound
quality
and
battery
life
do
not
like
the
fact
that
you
can't
power
the
device
on
and
off
could
only
get
the
left
side
to
work
received
earbuds
about
weeks
ago,
were
working
fine
for
about
days
but
now
the
sound
in
the
right
earbud
is
soo
much
lower
than
the
left
one
like
the
battery
life,
distance
from
source,
and
rich
sound
versatile
and
quick
connect
use
with
my
phone,
pc,
and
tv
am
still
using
them
today
had
minor
issue,
customer
service
was
very
prompt
and
helpful,
sound
is
great,
very
comfortable
with
extra
ear
pieces
included,battery
life
surprisingly
good
really
cool
product
sound
quality,
performance
of
headphones
is
great
bummed
that
they
won't
take
charge,
won't
stay
connected
to
their
docking
station,
and
won't
work
anymore
you
get
what
you
pay
for
back
to
shopping
for
earbuds
again
like
the
way
they
fit
in
my
ears
the
sound
is
clear
have
been
working
with
the
company
to
see
if
can
get
another
pair
at
discount
price
love
these
it
is
nice
product,
what
like
is
the
sound
and
the
comfort
on
wearing
them,
read
some
reviews
about
some
customers
complaining
that
they
can't
hear
the
person
they
are
talking
to,
but
they
can
hear
me
the
only
issue
found
is
the
battery
life
it
has
good
sound
quality,
but
hard
to
use
one
at
time,
and
the
right
one
is
broken
no
longer
plays
any
sound
stop
to
order
for
more
that's
how
good
they
are
can't
beat
the
price
have
tried
few
different
manufacturers
of
earbuds
but
these
are
the
easiest
and
best
sounding
that
have
had
awesome
product
highly
recommend
great
product
for
the
price
my
only
complaint
is
that
it
so
easy
to
pause
or
start
your
music
due
to
accidentally
touching
the
side
of
the
bud
other
than
that
though,
they
are
great
they
both
stopped
working
after
days
of
owning
them
will
never
recommend
this
to
my
worst
enemy
would
purchase
again
useless
won't
stay
in
my
ears
extremely
easy
to
use,
great
sound
quality
decent
pair
of
headphones
especially
when
coupled
with
memory
foam
ear
buds
the
size
and
weight
of
the
ear
buds
are
just
right
the
sound
is
great
received
this
as
gift
and
will
do
the
same
for
someone
else
cant
hear
anything
but
the
smooth
music
and
the
bass
of
drums
in
my
ear
oh
i'm
only
on
half
volume
these
are
great
and
easy
to
connect
use
them
while
exercising
sound
is
great,
they
stay
snuggly
in
my
ear,
simple
to
pair
and
the
battery
life
is
sufficient
they
look
great,
are
very
convenient,
sound
great,
feel
great,
and
very
reasonably
priced
but
am
more
than
satisfied
with
its
sounds
quality
and
noise
cancelling
love
these
headphones
they
fit
nice
and
snug
but
don't
put
to
much
pressure
on
my
ears
although
my
first
pair
had
one
bud
start
to
fail,
they
replaced
it
very
quickly
great
sound
from
these
earbuds
love
that
they
are
wireless
this
is
the
first
pair
of
wireless
headphones
that
ve
had
so
far,
am
really
enjoying
them
loved
these
little
earbuds
until
the
case
wouldn't
hold
charge
after
months
total
bummer
like
these
better
than
my
bose
problems
with
unbalanced
volume
pasonomi
is
working
with
mei've
had
these
for
few
months
still
trying
them
out
but
so
far
so
good
fits
nicely
to
the
ear
and
case
is
small
enough
to
fit
into
pocket
sound
quality
is
very
good
sounded
nice
but
the
case
charge
them
in
quit
charging
one
they
will
not
honor
year
warranty
buy
at
your
own
risk
great
fit
great
sound
look
great
disappointed
by

he
runs

likes
that
they
stay
in
place
great
sound

eazy

is
amazing
and

quick
pairing,
nice
deep
bass,
comfortable

terrible
the

them
months

are
amazing
they
fit
comfortably
the
sound
quality
is
fantastic
the

life
is
really
good
would
definitely
recommend
to
others
it
was
gift
months
with
very
lite
usage
and
left
earbud
is
muffled
to
about
half
volume
need
company
info
to
contact
for
year
warranty
perfect
for
me
after
few
months
one
of
the
earbuds
just
quit
working
worked
fine
till
then
the
right
ear
stopped
charging
after
less
than
year
it's
pleasant
surprise
that
they
arrived
in
pretty
neat
packaging,
and
the
earbuds
are
of
great
build
quality
wish
they
were
louder,
but
like
them
otherwise
very
pleasantly
surprised
by
these
would
highly
recommend
over
any
other
high
dollar
set
and
love
that
they
charge
in
their
own
case
after
having
the
earbuds
for
one
year,
the
left
bud
quit
working
the
warranty
is
only
good
for
six
months
fits
comfortably
in
the
ears
use
them
for
working
out
and
don't
have
to
turn
them
up
super
loud
to
cancel
out
the
gym's
music
easy
to
set
up
and
connect
these
earbuds
are
amazing
quality
for
an
amazing
price
they
have
great
sound
quality
and
are
very
comfortable
love
them
they
fit
great,
easy
to
hook
up
slim
so
they
arnt
bulky,
loud
and
comfy
use
em
every
day
would
buy
again
way
better
then
my
samsung
and
airbuds
highly
recommend
awesome
deal
my
right
channel
decreased
in
volume
significantly
and
now
can
only
use
the
left
earbud
would
be
fine
with
this
product
if
the
support
team
would
respond
to
my
inquiry
but
they
haven't
clarity
is
excellent
sound
is
soft
and
tinney
and
real
pain
to
sync
doesn't
block
ambient
very
well
comfortable
fit
and
paired
instantly
with
my
phone
like
the
rechargeable
case/batter
pack,
however
the
headphones
themselves
only
hold
charge
for
about
0hrs
it
was
hard
to
pair
with
blue
tooth
device
love
these
earbuds
was
little
skeptical
if
they
would
slightly
fall
out
of
my
ears
during
long
runs/workouts
and
can
assure
you
they
do
not
have
zero
complaints
was
skeptical
at
first
but
couldn't
beat
product
came
in
excellent
condition
audio
quality
is
crisp
love
the
sound
works
great
use
them
daily
while
working
my
husband
loves
his
the
noise
canceling
works
well
even
when
he
working
with
loud
equipment
being
able
to
charge
the
phone
from
the
case
is
also
great
love
these
wireless
heads
phones
extremely
comfortable
to
wear
feels
like
you
are
wearing
nothing
decent
wireless
headphones
but
short
connection
distant
and
battery
life
doesn't
connect
well
to
my
s0,
also
only
one
works
0%
of
the
timedisappointed
these
fit
very
well,
are
easy
to
sync,
and
have
really
good
sound
love
these
when
work
out
they
stay
in
place
too
best
wireless
earphones
very
easy
to
use,
great
sound,
and
fit
well
in
my
ears
best
earbuds
ever
have
really
comfortable
it
fits
my
ears
also
the
charger
is
fancy
love
these,
they
fit
in
my
ear
perfectly
the
sound
is
amazing
and
it
doesn
take
long
to
charge
they
are
definitely
worth
the
money
great
quality
had
question
about
the
warranty
of
the
product
in
case
of
any
issues
and
my
concerns
were
resolved
immediately
love
the
product
simply
terrible
earbuds
don't
buy
themi'm
surprised
why
they
have
all
these
good
reviews
good
product
the
only
issue
have
with
it
is
that
it
is
very
easy
to
accidentally
touch
the
sensor
&
it
pauses
the
sound,
but
that
is
minor
annoyance
it
would
disconnect
sometimes
and
the
battery
life
did
not
last
as
long
as
it's
advertised
it
better
than
my
image
it
comforts
when
you
take
it
great
product
good
sound
and
long
battery
excellent
customer
support
when
required
support
thank
you
really
liked
these
headphones
initially,
had
some
troubles
with
them
staying
in
my
ear
while
at
the
gym
but
besides
that
really
enjoyed
them
until
about
two
months
in
the
charging
part
on
the
left
headphone
went
out
was
surprised
at
how
good
the
sound
quality
is
just
is
got
them
today
and
have
used
them
sense
got
them
best
earbuds
so
far
that
have
had
work
perfectly,
the
sound
quality
is
great,
the
battery
life
is
great,
and
it
fits
without
causing
discomfort
they
have
quite
bit
of
treble,
not
much
bass
compared
to
other
wirelss
headphones
in
the
price
range
these
things
are
hot
garbage
the
sound
is
awful
got
refund
but
had
to
pay
for
shipping
to
return
them
stay
far
away
these
are
great
when
they
work,
but
the
bluetooth
connection
is
pretty
weak
more
times
than
not,
the
connection
is
lost
few
times
durning
one
song
they
are
really
easy
to
charge
and
pair,
like
listening
to
music
loudly
and
these
provide
the
bass
and
noise
cancellation
that
need
love
that
convenience
they
fit
perfectly
in
your
ear
use
them
at
the
gym
and
have
not
had
problem
had
these
for
about
year
didn
use
them
heavily,
so
am
disappointed
that
they
stopped
working
sound
quality
isn
that
great,
but
it
still
great
piece
for
the
price
amazing
quality,
great
sync
to
videos
and
they
aren
bulky
definitely
recommend
these
just
got
these
earphones
and
love
them
great
sound
and
noise
cancellation
and
they're
comfortable
would
definately
recommend
this
was
the
easiest
bluetooth
item
i've
ever
paired
the
sound
doesn't
have
much
bass
but
use
them
mostly
for
podcasts
where
everything
sounds
perfect
would
recommend
this
product
the
product
was
outstanding
and
met
every
expectation
would
highly
recommend
it
especially
for
runners
great
set
of
earphones
the
case
is
really
handy
and
the
touch
controls
intuitive
love
the
sound,
works
with
both
ears
or
just
the
left
works
great
on
my
walks,
no
connection
issues
at
all
they
work
great
love
them
high
recommend
the
customer
service
was
also
great
when
there
was
warranty
issue
use
these
for
running
at
minute
mile
pace
the
pros
are
that
love
not
being
tethered
to
cord
the
con
is
sometimes
they
fall
out
and
it
annoying
good
sound,
good
comfort,
would
recommend
to
every
music
lover
out
there
got
these
and
so
far
haven
had
any
issues
with
them
they
sound
great
they
worked
amazing
for
month
and
now
the
left
ear
wont
play
any
sound
little
mad
about
that
awesome
used
for
two
weeks
now,
the
quality
of
the
sound
is
really
good
it
good
substitute
for
the
apple
ones
worth
way
more
than
it
price
highly
recommended
make
sure
you
use
the
correct
size
of
the
ear
gummies
it
makes
huge
difference
love
these
very
very
much
welp
worked
just
long
enough
to
get
past
the
return
date
days
later
and
right

in
the
carrier
guess
should
have
bought

figured
they
work
well
hard
for
other
people
to
hear
me
noise
cancellation
is
not
good
you
can
hear
all
the
other

they
are
super
loud
can't
hear
thing
while

every

very
convenient
headset

places
where

used
them
for
the
first
time
at
work
today
and
they
were
great
couldnt
hear
thing
and
they
still
havent

in
your
ear
as

and
the
battery
charge
is
pretty
reliable
great
order
bought
these
for
my
husband
he
loves
them
worst
product
i've
bought
yet
after
week
only
one
site
works
il
try
all
type
and
the
left
site
alway
falls
off
really
good
for
the
price,
especially
the
sound,
but
the
battery
runs
out
pretty
fast
needs
to
constantly
be
charged
great
sound,
somewhat
noise
canceling
and
very
comfortable,
even
for
small
ears
product
came
in
well
packaged
use
them
for
work
and
mowing
and
couldn
have
gotten
better
deal
for
good
price
fits
in
my
ears
perfect
don
fall
out
or
anything
they
work
as
advertised
it
was
really
fast
use
the
earbuds,
liked
them
lot
great
buy
for
the
money
i'm
not
sure
why
anyone
would
buy
samsung
buds
or
apple
buds
besides
the
status
symbol
great
ear
buds
highly
recommendedawesome
sound
and
fit
wonderfully
the
headphones
are
decent
"won"
refund
on
the
product
but
never
received
it
just
got
the
run
around
the
power
bank
lasts
long
time,
but
the
battery
life
of
the
actual
headphones
is
kinda
weak
but
still
recommend
them
cannot
use
for
work
purposes
as
there
is
no
functioning
micthey

fine
for
the
gym
but

not
dual

sound
quality
is
very
good
happy
with
product
do
not
buy
they
fall
of
extremely
easy
and
it
has
touch
screen
function
so
if
it
falls
off
your
pausing
or
unpausing
it,
and
that
can
get
annoying
quick
after
having
it
for
weeks
deeply
regret
buying
them
these
are
high
quality
and
easy
to
use
earbuds
setup
is
simple
i'm
very
happy
with
this
purchase
nice
sound
quality,
would
be
nice
if
could
use
them
longer
than
an
hour
and
half
very
poor
battery
life
:
got
to
sweaty
and
the
left
one
went
out
great
headphones,
use
them
when
go
jogging,
they
are
super
light
sound
quality
is
great
best
wireless
headphones
so
far
these
are
really
awesome
they
did
link
up
quick
with
the
blue
tooth
sound
quality
is
amazing
would
highly
recommend
anyone
looking
for
headphones
to
get
these
a+++
the
earbuds
fit
really
well,
stay
in
while
running
and
working
out
and
sound
good
battery
life
has
been
really
good
so
far
the
first
pair,
the
sound
went
low
in
one
ear,
but
the
customer
service
was
excellent
and
received
replacement
pair
in
days,
and
so
far
haven
had
any
problems
so
far
with
this
second
pair
returning
item
only
used
twice
every
other
time
attempt
to
use
it
cannot
connect
them
to
bluetooth
good
product
for
the
money
didn't
realize
how
much
needed
pair
of
affordable
bt
earbuds
the
ear
phone
buds
are
easy
to
slip
through
fingers
gripping
is
poor
or
slipping
off
during
shower
on/off
is
too
sensitive
and
an
unintentional
touch
would
turn
it
on/off
battery
life
is
not
as
long
as
vendor
claims
works
great
fitment
is
excellent
stays
in
my

even
during

and
while
working
great
fit,
great
sound,
and
great
battery

the
sound

the
right
side
ear
bud
stopped

and
can't
even
get
it
to

anymore
waste
of
money
don't
buy
this
loved
the
sound
of
this
product
the
battery
life
is
awesome
am
very
excited
to
have
these
headphones
sounds
good,
works
great
love
it
works
great
beatifull
sound
and
great
customer
service
was
able
to
connect
to
my
phone
easy
i'm
not
allowed
to
have
my
phone
out
at
work
but
can
use
these
to
play
music
while
i'm
working
and
no
one
notices
love
these
earbuds
work
great
with
any
task
and
fit
in
your
pocket
easily
and
can
charge
my
phone
to
fulltwice
solid
pair
of
buds,
lots
of
recharges
on
the
battery,
can
get
almost
full
charge
on
my
s0
off
of
battery
if
you
have
long
hair,
don't
buy
this
it
keeps
on
pausing
whenever
my
hair
hits
the
earbud
while
walking
so
annoying
very
good
product
am
satisfied
and
it
is
what
expected
it
to
be
recommend
everyone
to
try
it
just
make
sure
you
keep
your
base
charged
up
so
you
can
take
it
with
you
just
in
case
they
go
dead
this
feature
is
great
there
is
excellent
sound
quality
had
some
connectivity
issues,
however
their
customer
support
was
amazing
and
had
it
figured
out
in
no
time
worked
great
for
about
two
months
at
that
point
the
left
earbud's
volume
started
decreasing
with
every
day
it
hasn't
been
three
months
yet
and
essentially
have
to
listen
with
only
one
ear
bud
these
ear
buds
are
awesome
they
fit
comfortably
in
my
ears
the
sound
quality
is
great
definitely
worth
the
price
bought
two
sound
quality
is
not
good
in
places
outdoor
also
the
buds
are
very
sensitive
and
calls
disconnect
just
by
touch
the
sound
on
both
ear
buds
are
different
at
times
and
cause
poor
sound
quality
so
far
worth
every
penny,
no
complains
would
buy
again
this
earphones
are
really
amazing
and
of
good
quality
strongly
recommend
this
product
sound
quality
is
nice
and
the
battery
lasts
for
hours
even
after
continuous
use
these
died
on
me
completely
they
won't
sync
or
charge
anymore
disappointed
used
twice
and
they
are
terrible
take
forever
to
connect
and
sync
up
poor
quality
sound
return
window
closed
and
now
am
out
$0
great
ear
buds,
for
the
price
they
can't
be
beat
use
these
every
night
at
work,
they
are
wonderful
they
never
fall
out
of
my
ear
and
the
rain
doesn't
affect
their
performance
haven't
found
any
complaints
yet
they
both
worked
for
about
week
now
only
works
waste
of
money

out
after
one
month
barely
even
used
it
in
the
gym
and
now
can
return
them
totally
waste
of
time
when
only
one
produces
consistent
sounds
should
ve
paid
more
for
real
pair
worth
the
price
used
this
product
for
workout
and
only
worked
for
week
now
it
won
charge
really
disappointed
esta
bonito
el
diseño,
me
encantan,
funcionan
muy
bien
buena
calidad
les
doy
estrellas
sin
duda
exelente
not
very
loud
but
great
little
set
for
working
out
in
the
gym
or
going
for
run
they
definitely
stay
in
your
ears
won't
even
work
for
an
hour
after
complete
charge
money
down
the
drain
this
bluetooth,
is
simply
garbage
the
battery
is
dead
after
hour
user,i
don't
recommend
this
item
high
quality
sound,
long
battery,
lots
of
charges
from
the
case,
and
they
don't
fall
out
wanted
to
use
this
for
business
calls
since
work
remotely
but
they
never
worked
properly
and
the
sound
was
terrible
yuck
earbuds
broke
within
oneday
received
these
yesterday
and
they
worked
well
but
this
morning
they
did
not
want
to
pair
to
each
other
it's
know
still
can't
get
them
to
work
i'm
returning
them
truly
horrendous
sound
quality
just
while
walking,
the
volume
in
each
ear
will
randomly
fluctuate,
sometimes
cutting
out
entirely
not
particularly
comfortable
eitheri
would
not
recommend
purchasing
these
earphones
very
nice
quality
earbudsalso
after
lost
my
earbuds
accidentally
pasonomi
is
going
to
send
me
new
replacement
for
the
lost
love
them
awesome
earbuds
but
have
to
speak
little
loud
for
the
person
on
the
other
end
of
the
call
to
hear
me
light,
excellent
sound,
waterproof,
highly
recommend
to
anyone
looking
for
upgrade
in
sound
quality,
better
than
my
beatz
wish
there
was
size
that
fit
my
feminine
ears
better
love
them
great
sound
quality
and
comfortable
got
these
couple
of
months
ago,
they
work
pretty
well
for
me
can't
complain,
and
at
very
affordable
price
point
it
works
amazing
the
first
months
and
then
it
somehow
just
stops
and
acts
like
one
of
those
earbuds
that
you
buy
at
dollar
tree
for
dollar
and
surprisingly
it
doesn't
work
easy
set
up,
and
sounds
good,
instructions
included
just
got
them
and
so
far
they
re
working
great
this
great
alternative
to
airpods
small
and
compact
fits
in
the
ear
perfectly
excellent
sound
quality
no
issues
with
pairing
or
charging
after
about
week
of
use,
the
left
earbud
stopped
working
it
still
plays,
but
have
to
turn
it
all
the
way
up
and
can
barely
hear
it
maybe
just
got
bad
pair,
but
it
is
not
working
well
for
me
these
earbuds
came
recommended
by
different
people
so
figured
try
them
very
reasonably
priced
and
easy
to
use
muy
buena
compra
left
bud
quit
charging
and
now
it
will
not
connect
to
my
phone
bought
this
as
birthday
gift
to
my
friend,
he
likes
it
lot,
now
kind
of
want
to
get
one
for
myself
too
great
bluetooth

great
for
voice
podcasts,
etc
music
okay
but
weak
on

they
fit

overall
decent
headphones

tried
resetting
them
with

my
house
and
didn't
lose
any
sound
used
on
the
s0+,
sound
quality
was
great
great
product
at
great
price
these
are
great
earbuds
and
customer
support

great
you
guys
are
the
worst
it's
completely
different
buds
from
what's
shown
‍♂
great
product,
love
the
fit
and
easy
to
use
they
charge
super
fast
in
the
charging
case
and
the
sound
quality
is
good
too
these
headphones
are
wonderful
the
sound
and
quality
of
the
earbuds
are
better
than
expected,
especially
for
the
price
amazing
product
cant
hear
anything
when
i'm
wearing
them
easy
to
pair,
kinda
weird
when
you
just
want
to
wear
one
fits
in
the
ear
perfectly
battery
life
in
the
earplugs
could
be
longer
that
way
you
could
leave
the
case
in
your
car
or
at
home
like
how
loud
they
get
my
wife
loves
them
great
reception
and
battery
life
easy
to
get
used
to
battery
life
is
amazing
sound
quality
is
great
just
like
the
earbuds
great
love
this
product
small
and
easy
to
use
bought
these
for
my
son
inlaw
he
says
they
sound
great
and
stay
in
his
ears
during
activities
they
have
pretty
long
battery
life
the
sound
is
just
amazing
and
customer
support
is
really
nice
if
you
have
any
questions
use
these
at
work
can
only
have
one
in
at
time
so
being
able
to
use
one
and
keep
other
on
charger
is
great
it
good
great
option
for
the
price
love
the
distance
range
these
have
far
better
than
any
other
ones
have
can
here
my
music
while
driving
lawn
mower
it
doesn
go
loud
enough
also
the
buds
hurt
my
ears
after
wearing
them
for
like
and
hour
these
seems
to
be
made
of
quality
materials
but
volume
is
weak
and
bass
is
non
existent
trying
to
listen
to
music
in
gym
or
any
slightly
loud
environment
is
awful
you
get
what
you
pay
for
the
sound
is
great
fits
perfectly
in
the
ear
comfortable
to
wear
and
the
battery
life
is
amazing
best
ear
buds
have
ever
owned
worked
fine
until
about
days
now
one
of
the
headphones
just
stopped
working,
would
say
its
fine
but
don't
think
they
are
made
very
well
perfect
fit
they
stay
in
my
ear
during
workouts
one
ear
bud
died
within
days
and
it's
the
0nd
pair
i've
gotten
can't
return
after
days
they
got
messed
up
on
the
first
day
of
me
using
them
it
was
raining
outside
while
was
riding
my
bike
and
the
right
earbuds
got
messed
up
definitely
not
waterproof
like
how
easy
it
is
to
use
and
it
really
convenient
price
is
great,
recommend
it
worthless,
way
too
quiet,
and
take
good
five
minutes
to
synchronize
and
connect
to
phone's
bluetooth
there
not
good
great
product
great
product
recommend
to
those
who
enjoy
wireless
earbuds
that
cases
charge
with
it
too
its
an
amazing
product
loved
the
charging
case
and
very
discrete
for
use
during
work
loveee
love
really
liked
the
option
to
be
able
to
charge
my
phone
as
well
first
set
of
wireless
headphones
for
me,
was
very
satisfied
with
the
quality,
purchased
second
set
very
satisfied
and
easy
to
use
and
setup
sounds
great
and
can
jog
and
they
stay
in
place
great
buy
quick
delivery
they
paired
simply,
and
have
good
sound,
fit
was
easy
with
the
different
size
plugs
and
they
dont
fall
out
it
broke
down
after
month's
use
worst
wireless
headphones
for
the
price
people
really
need
to
stop
exaggerating
in
there
reviews
fits
comfortably
in
the
ear
with
good
sound
quality
the
cas
is
small
enough
to
fit
in
pocket
and
doubles
as
portable
charger
the
earbuds
can
survive
rain
this
product
was
very
easy
to
set
up
and
use
good
quality
and
would
buy
again
as
gift
broke
to
fast
like
my
new
earbuds
however,
they
don
cancel
out
the
noise
level
around
you
like
my
previous
pair
pissed
paid
extra
money
to
get
it
here
in
days,
and
the
left
headphone
doesn
work
very
good
quality,
probably
the
best
wireless
earphones
have
used
used
at
fitness
center
easy
to
use
and
pair
up
quickly
like
them
,
but
you
can
find
better
the
earphones
did
not
work,
am
sending
them
back
fair
product
love
these
headphones
the
headphones
pair
easily,
sound
great,
and
the
case
being
able
to
charge
your
phone
is
great
good
material
good
battery
life
doesn't
fall
off
and
good
amount
of
ear
pieces
nothing
bad
to
say
about
it
stoped
working
week
after
try
to
get
them
replaced
and
nobody
could
help
me
does
not
sync
to
my
phone
great
sound
quality,
was
pretty
surprised
with
the
quality
for
the
money,
it
is
great,
would
recommend
really
good
headphones
must
buy
great
so
far
have
for
around
month
have
to
recharge
after
two
hours
of
use
each
day
the
best
ones
ever
got
work
and
sound
grate
the
most
amazing
customer
support
ve
ever
dealt
withand
great
earbud
taboos
these
headphones
are
very
nice
and
sound
very
good,
the
battery
lasts
while
too
very
comfortable,
stay
in
my
ears
nicely,
definitely
waterproof
great
for
working
out
and
doing
any
other
activities
for
some
reason
the
sound
in
each
earbud
keeps
fluctuating
one
day
it
will
be
loud
in
one
ear
and
low
in
the
other
vice
versa
the
next
will
most
likely
be
returning
this
product
great
sound
for
the
moneygreat
fit
as
well
love
these
ear
phones,
they
fit
perfectly
in
your
ears,
sound
quality
is
superb
they
are
so
easy
to
use
and
they
dont
move
out
of
your
ears,
love
the
waterproof
is
awesome
don't
know
if
left
ear
bud
is
defective
or
is
suppose
to
be
considerably
quieter
than
the
right
ear
bud
would
say
is
only
half
as
loud
other
than
this
problem
everything
is
great
especially
for
the
price
long
battery
and
charging
case
is
durable
withstood
few
drops
already
battery
life
lasts
awhile,
but
connectivity
issues
like
these
ear
buds
good
price
and
quality
can
use
both
or
one
at
time
sound
good
for
$0
pair
of
war
buds
this
is
an
excellent
product
and
very
simple
to
set
up
the
sound
is
great
quality
would
have
rate
this
headphones
higher
except
for
the
fact
that
it
keep
slipping
off
my
ear
while
working
out
even
after
replaced
and
tried
multiple
earbuds
it
came
with
love
this
product
they
are
good
quality
and
sound
is
great
would
definitely
buy
again
usually
have
hard
time
fitting
ear
buds
because
of
my
small
ears
these
fit
and
stayed
in
place
the
bass
could
be
little
more
distinctive
but
over
all
not
bad
for
the
money

it
very
fantastic
product
especially
can
hear
the

clearly,
which
is
highly
important
for
me
sometimes
not

without
any

very
good

great
set
of

and

appears
to
be
very
good

very

love
this
earbud
its
amazing
and
the
sound
quality
is
very
loud
plus
it's
very
water
resistant,
worth
every
penny
other
than
constant
connectivity
issues
the
sound
volume
seemed
to
be
really
low
even
at
maximum
sound
is
horrible
do
not
buy
absolutely
no
bass
battery
goes
out
quick,
it
disconnects
for
noreason
the
charge
does
not
last
long
love
everything
about
the
earbuds
worthless
not
what
expected
wanted
was
expecting
better
than
this
llego
en
el
tiempo
estipulado
tal
cual
las
fotografías,
excelente
producy
the
sound
that
comes
out
of
these
is
so
clear
for
the
price
the
earbuds
stopped
working
with
music
and
any
audio
other
than
calls
love
these
headphones
very
long
battery
charge
great
headphones
especially
for
the
price
as
runner
always
looking
for
wireless
headphones
that
stay
in
good
and
these
do
great
investment
great
sound,
good
battery
life
and
loud
volume
this
is
the
best
value
for
the
price
the
only
downside
which
already
knew
would
be
thing
is
that
they
do
fall
out
of
your
ear
as
you
use
them
and
move
around,
so
you
will
have
to
keep
pushing
them
back
in
absolutely
love
my
new
wireless
headphones
quality
is
great
would
recommend
to
anyone
only
the
left
earbud
works
and
the
battery
life
sucks
like
the
fact
that
they
stay
in
your
ears,
and
they
are
pretty
comfortable
battery
life
is
good
and
the
fact
you
can
charge
your
phone
from
the
case
is
awesome
honestly
haven
gone
day
not
using
itsometimes
it
will
break
up
while
you
re
using
it
doesn
last
more
than
few
seconds
enjoy
this
product
because
for
the
price
it
delivers
good
performance
they
pick
up
all
the
background
sounds
and
send
them
to
the
listener
this
is
my
first
time
to
use
wireless
headphone
enjoy
it
great
bang
for
the
buck
they
work
great
no
problems
at
all
it
did
not
stay
charged
more
than
hour
needs
longer
charger
wire
included
with
the
product
other
then
that
everything
was
smooth
seem
great
so
far
very
nice
product,
battery
pack
as
case
was
great
idea
they
fit

only
complaint,
couldn't
figure
out
how
to
open
at
first
the

where
usb
plug
is
opening
in
side
love
that
the
head

perfectly
in

while
working
out
with
it
easy
to
connect
with

this
product
hit
the
price/quality
curve
perfectly
for
me
everything
works
great
recommend
it
fits
well
in
my
ears
i'd
rate
it
higher
but
the
left
ear
bud
got
super
quiet
after
days
use
basically
non
existent
unless
you
use
it
by
itself
will
be
replacing
these
or
refund
these
are
so
nice
and
rhey
don
fall
out
onceto
put
them
in
it's
good
comfortable
and
easy
to
use
the
sound
is
not
really
good,
but
ok
use
the
ear
buds
in
the
gym
to
drown
out
other
noises
that
im
focused
it
is
one
of
the
best
set
of
earphones
have
bought
to
date
and
love
them
very
happy
with
my
purchase,
these
are
hands
down
the
best
earphones
have
ever
owned
use
them
because
my
volume
on
the
phone
is
to
low
its
perfect
with
the
ear
buds
just
put
them
in
my
partner
and
his
friends
are
playing
video
games
and
happily
listening
to
podcast
and
can
barely
hear
them
haha
so
that
cool
keeps
dropping
the
audio
great
fit,
great
sound,
and
fully
wireless
love
these
earbuds
for
working
out
and
traveling
the
charging
case
is
hard
to
open

the
gym
bought
these
in
december
and
they

already
giving
me
issues

only
hear
from
one
side
and
already
tried

great
really
enjoyed
this
product,
but
lost
right
ear
piece
hopefully

pretty
good
had
my
doubts
on
if
they
would
feel
comfortable
or
but
its
perfect
the
sound
quality
is
amazing
and
it
noise
cancels
everything
as
soon
as
you
put
int
the
earbuds
they
cut
out
sometimes
but
there
is
nothing
comparable
for
the
price
just
as
advertised
qualityproduct,
nice
case
and
sounds
great
the
sounds
quality
is
great
have
bose
headphones
and
they
sound
just
as
good
these
headphones
are
great
quality
the
sound
is
awesome
and
it
comes
with
multiple
size
headphone
enhancers
like
that
the
product
comes
with
different
sized
ear
buds,
as
have
issues
frequently
with
them
never
fitting
correctly
holds
charge
throughout
my
workouts
hard
to
use
and
expensive
for
what
you
get
requires
too
much
to
get
them
working
properly
ended
up
staying
with
my
old
bluetooth
ear
buds
instead
they
are
awesome
everytime
you
connect,
you
will
have
issues
it
does
not
connect
automatically
it's
either
0%
it
will
connect
or
0%
horrible
connectivity
technology
they
look
cool,
sound
good,
last
long,
are
comfortable
and
easy
to
set
up
great
headphones
with
good
battery
and
case
just
need
better
ear
pieces
honestly
they
are
not
worth
the
money
battery
life
is
horrible
like
it
use
it
to
hear
music
as
well
as
for
talking
bought
it
once,
and
one
of
the
earbuds
just
stopped
working
was
offered
replacement,
but
even
this
pair
stopped
working
after
few
weeks
don't
buy
it
waste
of
money
love
these
new
ear
buds,
fit
my
ears
great
and
sound
is
also
great
only
thing
ve
heard
is
that
when
are
on
call
you
sound
far
awaybut
it
bluetooth
sound
quality
is
horrible,
you
can
hear
everything
in
the
background
feels
as
if
they
will
fall
off
anytime
the
new
set
was
easy
to
sync,
sound
quality
good,
and
battery
life
as
stated
so
far
it
been
very
good
great
sound
quality
and
bass
great
product
works
as
advertised
love
the
fact
that
it
has
multiple
uses
they
say
hour
battery
life
have
yet
to
experience
that
can
get
to
hours
on
an
overnight
charge
great
earbuds
good
sound
quality
and
the
case
charges
the
earbuds
lot
of
time
overall
good
product
hook
to
tv
via
bluetooth,
unable
to
turn
volume
down
on
the
earbuds
highly
recommend
these
ear
buds
great
sound
and
fit
if
you
spend
lot
of
time
commuting
and
listening
to
music
without
the
wires
these
are
the
ones
for
you
way
better
than
the
popular
brand
out
there
and
the
price
is
affordable
you
definitely
get
what
you
paid
for
good
sound,
not
to
heavy,
good
overall
don't
be
fooled
absolute
trash
awkward,
poorly
designed
how
like
to
listen
to
music
it
works
wonderfully
and
would
definitely
recommend
it
great
for
work
love
how
you
can
use
them
separately
while
the
other
one
charges
easy
to
use,
good
fit,
good
sound
quality,
good
batteey
life
really
good
option
only
one
ear
bud
worked
got
airpods
instead
much
better
it
doesn
seem
to
work
correctly
it
constantly
disconnects
from
my
devices
do
not
recommend
will
be
trying
to
get
my
money
back
right
earbud
quit
charging
all
around
great
headphones,
only
complaint
is
that
they
feel
like
qtips
in
your
ear
at
first
until
you
get
used
to
them
and
that
the
base
is
little
lacking
these
earbuds
are
amazing
quick
paring
to
any
device
that
own
and
the
sound
quality
is
very
good
great
headphones
had
no
issues
connecting
them
to
phone
first
try
sound
quality
is
good
amazing
quality,
absolutely
love
it
from
arizona
great
product
they
have
been
easy
to
use,
have
good
sound,
and
good
charge
sent
as
gift
waste
of
money
really
wanted
to
like
these
they
worked
great
for
the
first
few
uses
then
one
earbud
would
not
charge
otherwise
the
fit
was
good
and
the
sound
was
good
to
was
never
able
to
connect
to
my
phone
tried
on
multiple
phoneswaste
of
money
feel
loose
but
do
not
fall
out
for
full
hour
work
day
comfortable,
only
use
one
at
time
and
they'll
never
be
dead
love
these
earbuds
bought
them
for
mowing
the
grass
and
they
work
perfectly
they
sound
great
but
they
fall
out
of
my
ears
for
the
price
point
works
extremely
well
had
problem
with
the
audio
but
the
seller
fixed
the
problem
great
product
for
price
seems
to
stay
in
ears
well
during
activity
easy
to
pair
with
blue
tooth
device
haven
had
these
long
but
work
really
good
they
don
fall
out
on
run
only
complaint
is
music
skips
if
only
using
one
earbud
the
product
is
really
good,
easy
charging,
the
pairing
mechanism
is
smart
not
worth
$0
these
are
great
as
gift
or
for
yourself,
would
and
am
recommending
good
sound,
but
it
being
two
weeks
and
the
right
headphone
is
giving
me
problems
excellent
bluetooth
headphones
the
charging
case
is
awesome
and
it
also
charges
your

sounds
amazing
and
never
fall
out
i'd
looking
for

gift
item

even
trying
the
other

good

constantly
going
in

out
really
liked
the
way
they
felt
and
the

they

functioned
well
since
got
them
it's
product
easy
to
connect,
the
quality
is
good
use
these
for
the
gym
&
love
them,
no
wires
hanging

it
battery
life
ridiculous
as
an
avid
earbud
user
these
are
very
comfortable
and
the
sound
quality
is
more
than
good
they
re
ok
for
the
price
still
don
understand
how
to
turn
them
off
and
the
sound
isn
spectacular
but
for
$0
it
does
its
job
connection
is
very
spotty
sound
keeps
cutting
in
and
out
unless
my
phone
is
very
close
to
my
head
especially
bad
when
my
phone
is
in
my
pocket
or
am
walking

everyone
sound
is
great
love
them
better
than
expected
amazing
quality
and
easy
to
use
could
not
get
them
to
pair
at
the
same
time
had
them
for
over
month
now
and
still
won't
work
only
one
plays
at
time
easy
to
setup
and
listen
right
out
of
the
box
comfortable
fit
and
great
sound
used
this
product
as
gift
had
ear
buds
for
approx
two
weeks,
they
work
as
advertised,
quality
product,
well
made
would
buy
again
it
was
too
good
productsound
quality
is
too
good
like
the
style
dislike
the
noise
cancellation
this
is
an
initial
review
since
just
got
them
recently
but
so
far
they
fit
really
well
and
the
sound
seems
pretty
good
so
far
solid
product,
served
it's
purpose
as
dailywear
alternative
to
the
samsung
icons
the
earbuds
work
great,
however
after
months
of
use
one
of
the
connecting
sensors
on
the
charging
device
broke
off
and
there
no
way
to
charge
that
one
now
when
on
call
it's
hard
for
them
to
hear
me
but
other
then
that
unlike
them
love
these
except
for
the
fact
that
they
won't
work
with
my
ipod
beware
piece
of
junk
save
your
money
sits
very
nice
in
the
ear
after
getting
used
to
them
you
don't
even
feel
them,
sound
quality
is
really
good
and
connects
easily
to
bluetooth
it
doesn
cancel
noise
very
well
the
sound
quality
declined
after
months
and
within
year,
only
one
earbud
was
working
sometimes
it
failed
pairing
with
my
phone
in
public
space
like
subway,
frequent
disconnection
happened
if
you
are
looking
for
some
good
headphones
you
should
buy
this
one
terrible
horrible
product
bought
these
for
pretty
decent
money
and
the
battery
only
lasted
maybe
three
hours
now
they
won
even
charge
or
hold
charge
worthless
excellent
earbuds
must
buy
you
will
be
very
happy
earbuds
are
small
and
easy
to
use
had
hard
time
pairing
at
first
but
since
then
they
have
been
great
you
can't
walk
to
far
away
from
your
phone
or
tablet
amazing
clarity,
compact
design
the
case
charges
the
earbuds
that
is
huge
the
range
isn't
that
good,
my
phone
would
be
in
my
back
pocket
while
i'm
walking
and
they
still
would
cut
in
and
out
very
good
product
love
it
sound
quality
is
superb
highly
recommended
dope
don't
know
how
lived
without
good
earbuds
would
highly
recommend
pretty
okey,
good
for
the
price
have
never
been
able
to
get
them
to
charge
:
it
excellent
i'm
happy
with
this
headphonequality
sound
rechargeable
case
is
also
very
useful
he
chokes
when
listening
to
music
and
in
the
street
loses
signal
loved
these
earbuds,
but
after
days
of
use,
the
right
one
broke
and
don
know
why
don
know
if
it
was

love
these
bought
them
to
wear
on
our
motorcycle
rides
and
they
work
perfectly
incredible
sound
qualitysuper
easy
setuphappy
customer
for
sure
one
of
the
headphones
would
not
charge
hurts
my
ears
after
about
0min
due
to
the
size
or
fit
no
one
could
hear
me
returned
them
so
sad
really
liked
them
thought
these
would
really
last
lot
longer
just
wished
the
battery
lasted
longer
use
them
for
running
mostly
sometimes
the
sounds
cuts
off
and
bounces
from
headphone
to
headphone
the
sound
amazing

muy

love
it
like
them
but
they
don
stay
in
all
the
time
they
fall
out
sometimes
right
side

not
always
pair
great
sound
good
excellent
product
came
exactly
as
described
very
good
for
the
0$
range
good
bass
these
headphones
are
easy
enough
to
use,
but
after
testing
them
out,
the
audio
quality
is
absolutely
abhorrent
no
bass
whatsoever
it
stays
on
while
running
and
working
outgood
sound
quality
only
one
bud
works
after
few
months
of
moderate
use
totally
not
what
expected
played
very
low
so
far
am
completely
satisfied
dies
after
months
of
usage
short
battery
low
volume
they're
not
terrible,
but
other
cheap
brands
are
better
use
for
running
works
well
can
become
uncomfortable
over
time
was
so
excited
to
receive
these,
but
very
very
disappointed
there
was
virtually
no
bass
sound
definitely
not
true
to
the
recorded
sound
quality
of
my
music
very
comfortable
and
nice
sound
quality
would
buy
them
again
great
earphones
for
the
price
nice
tool
to
use
especially
when
youre
working
in
yard
it
dont
hold

quick
to
pair,

potato
level,

them
at
first
glance

these
earphones
are
great
