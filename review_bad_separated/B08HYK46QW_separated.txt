very
nice
camera
system
for
the
price,
customer
service
very
helpful
and
responsive
had
an
issue
with
one
of
the
cams,
seller
was
very
prompt
to
resolve
problem
would
definitely
recommend
all
inclusive
system
almost
this
channel
system
has
only
four
cameras
and
trying
to
find
additional
cameras
took
lot
of
effort
their
instructions
are
quite
insufficient
and
the
ability
to
remotely
use
the
system
via
xmeye
was
totally
teach
yourself
experience
without
any
help
ve
tried
several
time
to
contact
them
with
both
installation
and
tech
questions
via
their
love@hiseeucom
customer
support
address
with
absolutely
no
response
recommend
consumers
seriously
consider
whether
to
purchase
this
product
since
they
obviously
don
care
what
happens
after
the
saleafter
purchased
the
system
they
immediately
wanted
me
to
write
customer
review
and
they
said
they
send
free
camera
well
that
was
also
lie
however,
could
forgive
that
lie
if
they
even
tried
to
so
some
interest
in
supporting
the
customer
they
haven
and
therefore
can
only
say
the
system
has
potential
but
without
any
interest
in
customer
support
have
to
recommend
that
people
consider
another
brand
received
as
expected
setup
was
fairly
easy
was
prewired
cloud
app
and
dvr
have
worked
well
for
the
last
two
months
other
then
the
time
zone
difference
customer
service
was
very
helpful
had
bad
camera
which
we
discussed
via
email
once
it
was
determined
to
be
bad
the
promptly
replaced
it
the
only
issue
have
is
the
ir
lights
reflect
of
my
very
light
colored
walls
looking
down
the
side
of
the
house
which
makes
it
difficult
to
see
at
night
very
easy
to
install
especially
if
you
have
attic
access
mounted
the
cameras
on
the
soffit
so
simply
drilled
one
inch
hole
in
the
soffit
and
pushed
the
camera
wiring
through
then
screwed
the
camera
in
place
put
the
unit
in
an
out
of
the
way
closet
to
make
it
harder
for
thieves
to
find
but
wanted
moniter
in
my
living
room
over
the
front
door
so
bought
cheap
monitor
for
the
closet
by
the
unit
for
when
need
to
review
footage
got
60'
hdmi
cable
to
run
from
the
closet
to
the
monitor
over
the
front
door
and
added
hdmi
splitter
so
could
have
both
monitors
active
at
the
same
time
the
included
cat
cables
were
more
than
long
enough
and
the
cameras
power
also
runs
through
the
cable
so
just
quick
connection
to
the
camera
and
the
unit
and
you
good
to
go
have
not
connected
to
the
internet
have
to
run
cable
from
my
modem
to
the
unit
but
will
do
so
soonvery
happy
with
the
system
cameras
have
good
picture
and
the
face
capture
is
nice
touch
it
does
record
sound
on
each
camera
but
is
only
available
on
playback
as
far
as
can
tell
but
thats
fine
face
capture
does
not
seem
to
work
well
on
night
vision
but
the
cameras
do
so
don't
see
that
as
real
issue
will
buy
this
again
for
any
future
houses
buyupdate:
figured
out
how
to
get
sound
to
play
live
you
have
to
mouse
click
the
sound
icon
on
the
screen
to
turn
on/off
sound
while
live
viewing
sound
will
still
record
for
all
cameras
for
playback
before
using
these
unit
had
samsung
cctv
channel
camera
and
was
looking
to
add
more
had
some
concerns
over
this
set
as
have
never
used
or
heard
of
annke
beforeonce
received
the
unit
noticed
everything
was
well
packaged
nicely
and
everything
needed
was
inside
the
boxthe
cameras
were
straight
forward
to
install
just
like
my
previous
set
so
had
no
issuesafter
connecting
all
the
cameras,
setting
up
the
unit
was
straight
forward
with
easy
to
follow
on
screen
instructions
didn't
even
need
to
use
any
manualsthe
first
thing
noticed
when
using
annke's
software
on
the
cctv
is
that
it
was
very
quick
compared
to
my
samsung
cctv
everything
was
really
snappy
and
didn't
take
much
to
move
around
the
menu
it
does
not
come
with
remote
like
my
samsung
cctv
but
this
didn't
bother
me
since
the
annke
system
was
very
convenient
and
quickinitial
setup
of
all
the
cameras
was
super
easy
you
just
need
little
patience
to
browse
the
menu
to
learn
it
and
youll
have
no
issues
getting
it
set
up
the
way
you
want
iti
have
not
tried
the
mobile
app
as
have
other
cameras
with
that
functionality
so
didn't
need
it
after
our
cars
were
broken
into,
it
became
necessary
that
we
needed
security
system
in
case
another
incident
occurred
didn't
want
to
spend
thousands
on
system
that
required
monthly
subscription
or
extra
"addons"
to
make
the
user
experience
better
translated
as
pay
for
their
marketing
dept
after
lot
of
research
and
reviews,
this
system
was
exactly
what
we
needed
the
camera
images
are
clear
including
night
vision
and
are
simple
to
view
them
on
our
tv
and
phones
after
checking
the
cameras
to
make
sure
they
worked
properly
and
then
ran
the
provided
ethernet
cables
to
it's
final
destination,
the
cameras
were
simply
plug
and
play,
since
the
cables
provide
power
to
the
cameras
too
also
don't
have
to
worry
about
changing
batteries
or
weak
wifi
signal
using
this
systeminitially,
was
having
an
issue
connecting
the
dvr
to
our
internet,
and
after
an
email
to
their
help
desk,
kiki
from
hiseeu
quickly
responded
with
not
only
the
correct
troubleshooting
information,
but
went
above
and
beyond
to
make
sure
we
were
taken
care
of
they
even
offered
to
video
chat
with
me
to
ensure
everything
went
smooth
talk
about
great
customer
service
highly
recommend
this
system
and
hiseeu
this
system
works
great
was
able
to
set
it
up
and
have
it
running
in
few
hours
most
of
that
time
was
just
running
the
cables
the
system
works
great
and
does
everything
we
want
it
to
the
instructions
are
seriously
lacking
and
there
is
simple
pamphlet,
when
it
should
be
small
booklet
to
tell
you
how
to
set
all
of
the
functions
up
on
it,
however
for
basic
setup
it
is
pretty
self
explanatory
did
have
an
issue
with
one
camera,
but
saul
from
customer
service
answered
my
email
within
minutes
and
after
the
few
things
they
had
me
try
didnt
work,
they
had
another
one
to
me
days
later
he
followed
up
few
days
later
to
make
sure
it
was
better
was
gonna
give
it
stars
for
the
fact
that
the
fov
is
narrow,
but
needed
in
front
anyway
for
my
walkwayi
have
to
use
cameras
just
to
cover
my
front
yard,
which
is
where
both
of
my
vehicles
are
parkedthe
audio
can
only
be
on
one
camera
at
time
so
keep
it
on
the
middle
oneit
has
tripwire,
along
with
perimeter
and
zone
coverage
for
the
alarmsome
might
not
like
the
fact
that
it
only
goes
up
and
down
for
adjustment,
so
ya
will
have
to
play
with
the
camera
mounts
to
spin
it
around
to
get
the
right
angle,
so
for
now
if
its
mounted
its
just
straight
out
the
fronti
don't
know
why
hiseeu
put
the
mounts
on
upside
down,
had
to
turn
them
all
around,
because
when
you
mount
the
camera
you
was
the
cable
output
hole
to
be
at
the
bottom,
so
rain
or
moisture
can
not
get
into
the
base
mount,all
in
all
these
are
pretty
good
camerasfor
now
have
the
cables
hidden
on
the
awning
of
my
porch
because
wanted
to
make
sure
they
would
work
good,
next
am
going
to
add
conduit
boxes
to
each
camera
and
stash
all
new
cables
inside
each
one
connecting
each
box
via
pvc
pipe,
this
was
its
nice
and
clean
and
the
thieves
cant
cut
the
wires
easilyi
was
hoping
to
find
turret
cameras
on
hiseeus'
website
but
all
they
have
atm
is
bulletsi
will
post
any
updates
to
these
but
so
far
am
liking
them,
just
had
to
google
few
times
to

you
need
to

have
found
out
that
the
app
they
have
ya
use
is
perfect
for
it,
can
download
my
videos
to
my
phone
then
just
copy
them
to
my
computer
for
editingstay
tuned
for
more
updates
the
day
&
night
pictures
are
great
we
have
had
the
cameras
connected
and
in
use
for
about
weeks
and
have
zero
complaints
we
use
the
app
and
love
being
able
to
view
the
house
all
the
way
around
while
away
we
got
new
modems
and
to
change
the
system
over
from
old
one
to
the
new
one
was
piece
of
cake
we
had
some
user
error
issues,
reached
out
to
customer
service
and
they
were
extremely
helpful
and
got
us
educated
and
back
on
track
highly
recommend
this
camera
system
bought
this
set
of
cameras
to
try
different
brand
then
what
we
have
already
on
one
of
rental
properties
the
installation
was
easier
then
the
other
set
and
really
like
the
poe
dont
have
extra
wires
for
each
camera
have
to
plug
in
for
power
they
have
great
quality
picture
and
sound
had
hard
time
figuring
out
how
to
connect
the
app
to
my
phone
am
not
good
at
tech
stuff
so
sent
an
email
asking
for
assistance
and
customer
service
person,
kiki,
called
me
very
quickly
and
walked
me
through
it
she
also
sent
me
follow
up
email
and
directions
in
case
needed
them
she
was
very
nice
and
patient
with
me
have
several
more
rental
units
that
am
putting
cameras
on
and
will
be
purchasing
this
brand
again
read
the
good/bad
reviews
on
this
system
and
decided
to
take
chance
on
it
due
to
the
functions
that
were
advertised
and
the
price
am
happy
bought
this
system
so
far
first
thing
did
was
make
sure
it
worked
by
connecting
cam
to
the
dvr
and
firing
the
system
up
all
good
then
planned
the
dvr
location
and
wired
up
all
the
cam
wires
up
through
the
wall
and
across
the
attic
had
to
purchase
set
of
two
25ft
extension
wires
to
reach
the
farthest
cam
locations,
but
that
was
inexpensive
and
expected
the
set
comes
with
all
60ft
cam
wires
connected
everything
to
the
dvr
and
bam,
cam
views
all
working
and
nice
and
clear
there
are
many
settings
and
adjustments
that
can
be
made
which
the
instruction
book
touches
on
very
briefly
but
clicked
around
and
got
grasp
on
what
the
dvr
and
cams
can
do
after
little
while
figured
out
how
the
system
works
and
how
to
navigate
the
menus
the
camera
adjustment
instructions
come
with
the
individual
cams,
so
there's
two
sets
of
instructions
to
refer
to
had
no
trouble
setting
up
passwords
or
any
initial
registration
by
the
way,
in
addition
to
the
night
vision,
the
particular
cameras
in
this
set
have
single
bright
led
security
light
white
light
alarm
that
lights
up
when
the
cam
detects
motion,
which
really
like
you
have
to
set
the
light
to
come
on
for
each
cam,
its
in
the
dvr
settings
have
the
cam
on
my
front
porch
set
to
use
the
security
light,
also
to
sound
an
alert
beep
on
the
dvr
itself,
which
can
also
be
set
for
each
cam
that
is
separate
from
the
alerts
on
the
mobile
app
the
mobile
app
set
up
just
fine
and
it
actually
works
quite
well
right
after
installed
the
system,
left
town
on
trip
had
no
issues
viewing
all
cams
from
over
500mi
away
and
don't
even
have
high
speed
internet
on
my
end
got
alerts
when
turned
them
on
and
could
review
the
recorded
footage
on
every
single
instance
it
all
just
worked
as
advertised
also,
on
this
system,
you
can
add
up
to
ip
cams
that
connect
with
cat5
cable
directly
to
the
wireless
router
that
the
dvr
is
connected
to
and
it
will
pick
them
up
may
eventually
get
one
of
those
to
add
9th
cam
the
setup
on
this
system
is
very
easy
the
hardest
part
is
running
the
wiring
to
the
cameras
but
the
poe
power
over
internet
nvr
powers
the
cameras
through
the
ethernet
cable
so
you
don
have
to
have
an
outlet
near
the
camera
had
an
issue
getting
the
nvr
online
so
called
tech
support
to
my
surprise
the
call
went
very
smooth
spoke
to
johnny
and
he
had
me
up
and
running
within
minutes
the
night
vision
works
well
and
happy
with
the
daylight
picture
researched
and
compared
all
the
brands
on
amazon
before
pulling
the
trigger
on
hiseeu
they
didn
have
the
most
reviews
but
the
reviews
they
had
were
good
they
also
had
the
poe
nvr
with
hard
drive
already
installed
with
5mp
cameras
happy
with
my
decision
the
cameras
were
fairly
easy
to
set
up
if
you
have
bigger
size
home
be
prepared
to
order
extension
cables,
if
you
want
your
cameras
on
multiple
monitors
goodluck
with
that
the
night
vision
is
decent
as
long
as
bright
lights
are
all
around
the
motion
detection
is
pretty
good
although
it
doesn
keep
tracking
if
the
person
is
standing
still
on
camera
haven
been
able
to
set
up
the
mobile
able
due
to
an
ethernet
cord
not
being
long
enough
for
me
to
connect
directly
to
the
router
my
next
route
will
be
wireless
cameras
that
will
send
me
alerts
once
motion
is
detected
this
dvr
is
quite
small
but
powerful
all
the
cameras
are
easy
to
setup
but
note
that
you
will
need
to
do
some
running
of
wires
into
the
wall
this
is
device
that
did
not
require
any
internet
signal
as
internet
can
become
unreliable
with
signal
issues
or
power
outage
it
does
come
with
eight
cameras
so
you
have
plenty
of
different
cameras
to
work
with
they
all
come
with
eight
long
cables
as
well
to
connect
and
power
your
cameras
the
dvr
does
come
with
tb
hard
drive
that
you
can
actually
swap
out
for
bigger
drive
sizes
if
you
wanted;
however
you
will
need
to
open
up
the
unit
to
access
the
hard
drive
it
has
several
outputs
such
as
vga
and
hdmi
the
hdmi
is
nice
if
you
want
bit
of
sound
or
are
hooking
up
to
your
tv
normally
like
that
vga
part
as
it
allows
me
to
utilize
my
older
monitors
to
see
that
cameras
you
can
utilizes
iptv
cameras
with
the
dvr
but
you
will
need
to
purchase
those
separately
for
the
wireless
camera
you
will
need
to
get
some
kind
of
hub
to
connect
to
this
device
to
transfer
the
data
to
the
dvr
be
aware
that
there
is
lot
of
wiring
that
is
required
if
you
are
going
to
be
using
this
dvr
box
depending
on
the
quality
of
your
recording
and
settings,
your
tb
hard
drive
will
fill
up
quickly
what
is
nice
about
this
dvr
is
that
it
will
overwrite
older
footage
once
the
hard
drive
is
full
again
the
amount
of
footage
depends
on
the
quality
of
your
recording
would
recommend
getting
cameras
with
motion
sensor
recording
to
save
on
memory
space
there
is
wired
usb
mouse
that
is
provided
to
make
it
easier
to
navigate
through
the
system
once
it
has
been
plugged
into
the
system
would
recommend
leaving
this
device
bit
more
in
the
open
as
it
does
generate
heat
and
you
want
to
keep
proper
airflow
to
keep
it
from
getting
damaged
also
recommend
keeping
this
close
to
your
modem
or
router
to
give
it
reliable
signal
if
you
want
to
see
your
camera
through
your
phones
or
such
what
is
nice
is
that
it
will
continue
to
record
even
if
there
is
no
wireless
signal
so
you
have
bit
of
peace
of
mind
that
you
will
have
footage
in
case
of
possible
break
in
the
cameras
are
pretty
strong
it
gave
me
good
clear
view
during
the
day
and
has
automatic
night
vision
during
the
night
note
that
the
night
vision
cannot
be
seen
through
glass
as
the
light
would
just
reflect
back
onto
the
camera
if
you
were
to
try
to
point
it
towards
window
the
cameras
are
all
weather
proof
so
it
can
take
rain
and
such
tried
water
test
and
the
water
did
not
hinder
the
camera
too
much
overall
think
this
is
good
recommended
starter
kit
for
new
home
be
aware
that
with
any
camera
system
you
will
require
ton
of
cable
running
through
the
wall
but
the
rest
of
the
setup
such
as
wifi
and
monitor
are
very
simple
once
you
have
the
cameras
all
plugged
in
would
recommend
having
this
plugged
into
an
emergency
power
bank
in
case
of
power
outage
to
keep
the
device
running
little
longer
all
eight
cameras
come
with
all
the
accessories
needed
to
install
and
they
work
great
got
this
week
ago
on
black
friday
special
and
starting
to
set
it
up
this
weekend
have
two
of
the
four
cameras
installed
now
and
will
do
two
more
this
weekend
the
software
on
the
device
takes
little
getting
used
to
if
you
haven't
worked
with
security
camera
system
before,
but
have
ones
from
two
different
manufacturers
at
work
and
it's
not
significantly
differentso
far,
i'm
impressed
with
the
ease
of
setup
and
picture
quality
i've
recommended
this
to
family
members
already
tooonly
minor
caveat
there
doesn't
seem
to
be
an
ntp
option
to
have
the
device
set
its
own
time
from
an
internet
time
server,
which
seems
to
be
an
odd
thing,
but
not
game
stopper
either
shopped
around
for
several
months
before
deciding
on
system
to
buy
am
using
the
system
for
general
outdoor
home
security,
and
wanted
something
that
provided
good
image
quality
but
stayed
within
our
budget
bought
the
system
that
came
with
four
cameras
but
an
8channel
nvr,
so
that
can
expand
over
the
course
of
the
next
few
months
didn't
mind
running
the
wiring
myself,
and
prefer
the
stability
of
wiring
over
wifithe
system
actually
came
much
sooner
than
promised
even
though
it
was
prime
product,
amazon
indicated
it
would
take
week
to
reach
me
from
the
manufacturer
instead
it
still
only
took
the
two
days
everything
was
very
well
packaged
unboxed
everything
and
hooked
it
all
up
to
the
nvr,
and
the
nvr
to
the
router,
to
make
sure
everything
worked,
which
it
did
the
remote
could
be
little
sturdier,
but
don't
plan
on
using
it
there
is
startup
wizard
when
you
first
run
the
nvr
the
only
thing
would
wish
was
better
is
the
documentation,
which
know
other
people
have
mentioned
as
well
what
there
is
can
be
little
hard
to
follow
for
someone
who
is
not
super
techsavvy
and
needs
welldesigned
gui
to
help
them
navigate
it
is
manageable
though
and
within
two
days
of
the
cameras
arriving,
got
an
email
from
the
company,
asking
if
had
any
problems
and
reminding
me
of
the
contact
information
in
case
needed
assistance
or
had
questions
one
of
the
reasons
chose
this
system
was
because
of
the
good
things
had
read
about
their
customer
support
the
app
is
fairly
simple
to
navigate,
once
you
get
your
device
addedso
far
have
of
the
four
cameras
mounted
and
wired
i'm
happy
with
the
image
quality,
both
day
and
night
vision,
and
they
pick
up
audio
quite
well
i'm
waiting
to
see
how
they
will
hold
up
in
our
ny
winters
haven't
spent
ton
of
time
yet
in
the
captured
video,
using
things
like
the
search
and
alarm
features
if
feel
there's
anything
significant
to
add,
will
definitely
come
back
and
write
about
it
overall,
i'm
very
happy
with
the
purchase
5mp
cameras
as
clear
as
day,
love
it
being
poe,
as
data
tech
im
always
skeptical
of
cheaper
security
products,
but
to
appease
my
wife
we
went
cheap
to
see
if
its
what
we
would
want
as
said
for
being
the
cheapest
poe
5mp
camera
set
up
we
could
find
any
where
it
is
one
hell
of
bang
for
the
buck
starlight

wired
system
wiring
may
be
bit
more
trouble
to
install
for
most
folks
v's
wireless
however,
once
installed,
wired
system
is
generally
rock
solid
on
connectivity
the
60'
included
cables
were
long
enough
for
several
of
my
cameras
and
added
couple
of
100'
cables
to
reach
the
far
corners
of
the
house
had
some
slack
at
the
endthe
setup
wizard
worked
pretty
well
i'm
not
real
computer
hip,
so
there
was
bit
of
"trial
&
error",
but
the
screens
popped
up
reasonably
easy
i'm
pleased
with
the
quality
of
the
camera
displays
both
day
and
night
this
isn't
$1000
or
$2000
system,
so
wasn't
expecting
perfect
vision
with
the
cameras
i've
actually
done
some
playback
of
the
recordings
once
kinda
figured
out
how
it
worked,
can
reasonably
and
consistently
playback
specific
recorded
tracks
or
cameras
like
most
imported
products,
this
one
is
very
short
on
instructions
this
product
could
really
use
tutorial,
on
cd,
done
in
englishfor
this
market
by
someone
who
is
not
an
expert
on
the
unit
have
found
that
information
provided
by
people
that
are
very
knowledgeable
on
their
product
have
tendency
to
start
in
the
middle
of
the
learning
curve
and
really
skip
the
basics
will
say
that,
"if
can
figured
out
the
basics
of
this",
almost
anybody
can
"patience
grasshopper"
the
system
has
only
been
in
for
couple
of
weeks,
but
am
currently
very
pleased
the
above
pictures
are:
visitors
to
my
backyardthe
dogs
dug
in
under
my
fence
and
view
of
the
monitor
have
connected
to
the
nvr
currently
only
have
cameras
hooked
up,
but
am
going
to
add
couple
of
long
range
ir
cameras
to
take
in
my
shop
and
the
back
of
my
property
picture
quality
is
very
good
for
these
cameras
and
system
tech
support
is
very
responsive,
the
hdd
it
came
with
died
out
about
month
after
got
it
and
they
shipped
new
one
right
away
its
got
face
detection
so
it
makes
little
snapshot
on
the
recording
timeliness
when
it
detects
person
so
you
can
focus
in
on
what
that
person
was
doing
around
your
home
the
one
way
audio
is
really
good
as
well
to
hear
what's
going
on
have
cameras,
are
on
2nd
floor
so
the
mic
dont
think
catches
too
much
but
the
one
in
my
driveway
works
great
it
was
very
easy
to
run
the
wire
and
the
length
that
came
with
the
package
was
plenty
to
run
where
needed
it
tothe
app
is
very
easy
to
set
up
which
is
both
good
and
bad
the
good
is
you
don't
have
to
do
any
port
forwarding
on
your
router
but
the
bad
is
that
this
means
they
are
proxying
some
of
that
connection
to
their
servers,
no
knowing
where
those
are
being
hosted
these
cameras
really
are
an
incredible
value
had
arlo
cameras
before
installing
these,
and
the
picture
quality
and
night
vision
performance
is
so
much
better
than
the
arlo
cameras
that
it
doesn
even
seem
like
fair
comparison
with
these
cameras
at
night
with
zero
lights
on
around
my
house,
can
still
see
well
past
my
property
line
and
can
get
clear
enough
picture
for
facial
recognition
at
night
during
the
day
the
image
quality
is
simply
excellent
was
looking
at
other
much
more
expensive
poe
cameras
with
an
nvr,
and
glad
gave
these
chance
the
only
tip
have
is
instead
of
using
the
recommended
xmeye
app,
use
xmeye
pro
in
the
apple
app
store
both
are
by
the
same
company
and
use
the
same
login
information,
but
the
pro
version
of
the
app
has
much
better
and
cleaner
ui
with
greater
functionality
only
had
one
technical
issue,
which
was
my
fault
apparently
4k
television
sets
do
not
like
2560x1600
resolution,
or
at
least
mine
doesn
and
got
response
with
instructions
on
how
to
revert
to
the
base
resolution
within
day
of
sending
my
email
overall
very
pleased,
and
will
be
looking
at
hiseeu
for
future
camera
purchases
to
add
on
to
this
nvr
the
software
has
lot
of
options,
fairly
straight
forward
setup
if
you
ve
ever
dealt
with
electronics
the
video
quality
and
feeds
are
great,
especially
for
the
money
will
also
add
that
chatted
with
customer
service
real
quick,
and
they
were
extremely
fast
to
respond
and
very
helpful
thank
you
again
wasn't
sure
what
to
expect
200
dollars
for
poe
cameras,
nvr
with
hard
drive,
and
network
cables
personally
don't
see
how
they
sell
it
that
cheap
you
can
see
where
they
cut
corners
but
am
thankful
because
don't
want
to
pay
350
for
essentially
the
same
thing
the
choices
they
made,
would
makegood
interface,
and
software
choice
between
sd
or
hd
have
limited
bandwidth
at
my
cabin
so
love
itif
budget
isn't
an
issue,
you
aren't
buying
this
if
budget
is
concern,
you
should
be
buying
this
great
system
poe
is
the
way
to
go
and
this
system
delivers
came
with
everything
you
need
to
get
started
and
was
rather
easy
to
install,
pretty
much
plug
and
play
our
system
is
connected
to
65"
4k
tv
and
the
quality
of
the
cameras
is
great,
crystal
clear
instructions
regarding
system
settings
and
tweaks
aren't
provided
but
most
settings
are
self
explanatory
instead
of
the
included
wired
mouse
we
used
usb
wireless
mouse
and
works
well
definitely
would
recommend

this
is
the
third
camera
system
have
installed
in
my
houses
this
was
by
far
the
easiest
to
install
the
poe
combined
with
the
software
configuration
made
it
as
simple
as
can
be
in
the
past,
had
to
make
complex
configuration
setting
changes
for
networks,
etc
this
time
it
was
as
easy
as
downloading
program
and
taking
picture
of
the
ocr
code
everything
was
done
for
me
am
also
impressed
with
the
picture
quality
going
with
the
5mp
cameras
made
all
the
difference
in
the
world
from
my
old
720p
and
1080p
cameras
in
the
high
definition
mode,
can
actually
see
faces,
license
plates,
and
other
detail
am
very
satisfied
with
the
entire
system
gave
stars
for
tech
support
but
in
reality,
there
was
not
any
reason
to
have
to
engage
them
overall
the
system
has
been
easy
to
setup
have
the
four
camera,
that
came
with
the
unit,
and
additional
ovif
compatible
camera,
the
setup
wizard
found
all
of
them
with
no
problems
the
image
quality
is
very
good
and
the
infrared
view
at
night
provided
much
better
picture
then
expected
the
mobile
app
allows
you
to
view
all
the
cameras
on
your
phone
some
of
the
camera
functions
can
be
controlled
from
the
mobile
app
while
settings
like
the
infrared
vision
have
to
be
adjusted
from
the
nvr
interface
instructions
and
software
poorly
translated
into
english
qr
code
doesn't
work
several
qr
code
apps,
and
the
native
camera
couldn't
recognize
it
video
quality
is
poor
camera
wouldn't
enter
color
vision,
stayed
in
night
vision,
even
when
in
brightly
lit
room
can't
figure
out
how
to
view
the
stream
remotely
very
nonintuitive,
if
even
possible
so
far
so
good
easy
install
and
quality
image
instructions
in
broken
english
and
not
the
easiest
but
great
respect
the
company
and
their
efforts
great
to
work
with
if
you
have
any
questions
plug
and
play
only
with
the
cord
was
at
least
1015
ft
longer
the
hiseeu
5mp
poe
security
camera
system,
1tb
hd,
is
great
product
for
outdoor/indoorit
was
easy
to
set
up
the
nvr
and
the
android
app
xmeye,
and
am
not
an
it
guy
just
plug
and
playyou
can
zoom
the
camera
using
the
app
but
could
not
find
that
function
using
nvr
was
not
able
to
access
the
cameras
through
the
internet
browserit
comes
with
an
ethernet
cable
cat5e
to
connect
the
cameras
to
the
nvr
no
ethernet
cable
to
connect
nvr
to
routervideo
quality
is
very
good,
day
or
night
love
the
video
quality,
the
user
interface
is
simple
but
very
intuitive
have
yet
to
install
the
system
but
have
tested
the
system
and
it
looks
amazingi
have
installed
many
cctv
systems
and
this
one
with
its
price
point
is
perfectthe
app
is
very
nice
and
fastwill
update
and
give
more
info
after
initial
installation
did
lot
of
shopping
online,
in
major
warehouse
stores
and
of
two
other
product
installations
this
product
is
by
far
the
best
value,
quality
and
easy
to
setup
have
actually
installed
two
other
products
for
customers
and
the
hiseeu
is
the
best
for
features,
picture
quality,
record
and
playback
flexibility
the
dvr
automatically
pulled
in
monitoring
of
my
existing
"smart
led
bulb
360
degree
camera"
now
can
monitor
cameras
from
my
cell
phone,
local
pc
or
at
the
dvr
monitor
am
very
satisfied
with
this
product
and
recommend
it
to
anyone
seeking
security
system
of
quality
at
great
price
including
1tb
for
recording
on
the
dvr
couldn't
download
the
app
by
scanning
it
or
searching
for
it,
this
is
very
low
quality
product
you
can't
even
test
it
or
get
started
without
the
app
their
own
website
wouldn't
even
download
it
this
"call
saul"
tech
support
thing
is
totally
ridiculous
it's
only
certain
hours,
robotic
translator
as
you
are
dealing
with
some
type
of
chinese
company
and
customer
support
when
you
email
them,
they
use
translator
to
respond
for
the
love
of
god,
do
not
waste
your
money
here
the
hardware
quality
seems
ok
the
user
interface
is
terrible
have
experience
with
other
video
surveillance
system
and
they
are
much
easier
to
figure
out
the
documentation
provided
with
the
unit
is
poor
as
is
the
information
on
the
website
still
thinking
about
whether
to
return
this
product
but
probably
will
camera
kit
is
great
hooked
everything
up
to
test
before
installing
make
sure
to
update
version
softwareit
makes
big
difference
with
clarity
of
images
and
has
other
great
improvements
and
enhancements
change
system
password
and
your
good
to
go
upgraded
the
hdd
to
4tb
for
more
storage
power
off
nvr,
unplug
existing
drive,
plug
in
new
hdd
and
format
couldn't
be
any
easier
than
that
also,
the
customers
service
is
"exceptional"
sent
few
emails
with
question's
had
and
where
answered
within
few
hours
their
support
team
has
evening
hours
that
start
at

we
had
an

when
someone
walked
in
front
of
the
camera
at
night
contacted

they
were
phenomenal
in
helping
me
get
this
problem
fixed
they

would
definately
recommend
buying
this
product
am
happy
with
the
service
they

me
my
previous
laview
system
server
stopped
hosting
p2p,
can
no
long
remote
view
my
cameras
over
the
mobile
phone
saw
this
on
sale
and
purchased
the
entire
kit
all
had
to
plug
in
and
add
in
the
camera
pw
and
all
the
image
showed
up
also
used
the
camera
that
came
with
it,
very
clearyou
will
not
disappoint
well
when
hook
it
all
up
was
surprised
by
the
picture
quality
its
amazing
it
looks
fake
thats
how
great
it
is
,,comes
in
sd
you
can
switch
it
to
hd
wow
amazing
great
little
inexpensive
poe
security
camera
system
2k
cameras
have
good
quality
as
expected
familiar
with
4k
systems
and
got
what
expected
super
easy
setup
setup
can
be
challenging
but
the
results
are
very
good
and
really
like
the
added
simplicity
of
poe,
where
running
additional
power
lines
in
older
homes
can
be
difficult
if
outlets
are
limited
works
great
there
are
several
different
options
to
use
in
regards
to
settings
easy
set
up
love
these
cameras
always
know
who's
at
your
house
even
when
you're
not
home
cool
way
to
check
on
the
kids
playing
outside
tech
support
is
awesome
they
answer
right
away
and
help
you
through
any
problems
you
have
these
cameras
are
definitely
worth
the
money
just
for
the
peace
of
mind
the
cameras
are
great
you
can
zoom
in
and
have
choice
between
basic
or
hd
the
night
vision
is
pretty
good
my
main
complaint
is
the
motion
sensor
it
claims
that
the
lowest
sensitivity
will
not
pick
up
small
animals
it
does
and
more
the
shadows
from
the
tree
causes
it
to
constantly
go
offthe
customer
support
is
quick
to
respond
but
hard
to
understand
they
don't
speak
english
very
well
but
you
can
understand
most
of
it
def
recommend
this
security
system
setup
if
you
are
in
the
need
for
one
opted
for
the
wired
version,
because
distance
and
location
wasn't
problem
my
brother
has
the
wifi
versions,
loves
them
it
was
all
easy
to
setup
and
install,
mobile
app
is
nice
and
so
is
the
ui
for
the
nvr
highly
recommend
system
works
great
customer
service
was
excellent
am
still
learning
how
to
use
the
software
as
far
as
recording
and
system
settings
but
so
far
so
good
received
system
as
stated
and
very
easy
to
set
up
and
install
great
picture
day
and
night

issues

will
add
more
cameras

picture
looks
great
and
is
really
clear
replaced
my
old
security
cameras
with
the
hiseeu
5mp
poe
security
camera
system
what
difference
everything
needed
is
in
the

easy
to
install
and
set
up
plan
to
only
use
the
high
quality
hiseeu
cameras,
system

either
the

easy
to
set
upand
the

makes
the

phone,
they
reply
to
emails
but
no
help,
no
phone
communication
as
they
re
in
china
so
far
so
good
takes
little
patience
to
get
it
setup
the
interface
is
little
wonky
but
the
camera
quality
is
great
and
love
that
they
are
hardwired
by

great
product
already
in
love
with
these
cameras
even
the
ir
leds
make
the
night
vision
great
love
being
able
to
connect
to
them
remotely,
and
even
downloaded
the
app
for
my
computer
so
can
watch
the
cams
on
my
second
monitor
highly
recommended
these
cameras
work
great
can
view
the
cameras
on
the
app
as
long
as
router
is
directly
connected
to
the
nvr
set
up
was
not
super
easy
but
kiki
from
tech
support
was
able
to
get
me
squared
away
paired
these
cameras
with
cable
covers
to
make
the
install
very
clean
works
good
so
far
easy
installation
only
had
it
installed
for
about
week
the
night
vision
is
very
good
motion
detection
seems
to
be
working
well
also
time
will
tell
about
longevity

excited
to

great
things
from
others

buen

buen

this
is
definitely
the
nicest
annke
security
system
that
have
seen
to
date,
although
have
not
been
all
that
impressed
with
some
of
their
other
systems
the
cameras
provided
in
this
kit
are
of
much
better
quality
than
some
of
their
other
ones,
being
constructed
almost
entirely
of
metal
instead
of
the
cheap
plastic
they
use
in
some
otherswhile
the
cameras
are
obviously
not
ptz
they
do
provide
decent,
static
overview
of
the
area
you
are
pointing
at
and
in
good
or
bad
weather
the
kit
comes
with
pretty
much
all
that
you
need,
including
60'
cables
for
each
camera
if
you
need
something
longer
or
shorter
it
is
just
easier
to
go
on
ebay
or
amazon
to
try
to
find
custom
length
bnc
cable
as
crimping
or
soldering
the
cables
yourself
is
pain
there
does
not
seem
to
be
any
guidance
as
to
what
the
maximum
cable
run
on
these
units
should
bethe
biggest
problem
with
these
annke
systems
has
always
been
the
documentation
to
put
it
nicely,
chinese
manufacturers
rarely
provide
useful
documentation
while
the
documentation
provided
here
is
at
least
written
in
understandable
english,
the
details
can
be
rather
skimpy
in
places
you
may
have
to
do
some
experimenting
in
order
to
get
things
working
properlyi
would
also
be
remiss
to
not
mention
the
fact
that
any
streaming
video
going
over
the
internet
is
going
to
go
through
server
in
china
somewhere
there
really
is
no
way
to
know
for
sure
who
has
access
to
this
information
so,
if
you
are
feeling
especially
paranoid
you
may
want
to
look
at
system
that
is
either
based
in
the
usa
or
that
does
not
use
servers
in
foreign
countriesthe
included
1tb
mechanical
hard
drive
has
enough
capacity
for
most
people's
needs
to
hold
good
amount
of
historical
data
the
playback
features
are
very
basic,
but
good
enough
the
processor
that
this
unit
uses
is
just
adequate
enough
to
get
by
there
is
definitely
some
slowing
down
with
greater
number
of
cameras
though
you
can
get
slightly
better
performance
by
replacing
the
included
hdd
with
ssd
the
system
can
get
slow
but
seems
stable
have
never
had
system
completely
crash
on
me
to
date
it
can
"hang"
for
few
seconds
when
it
is
overloaded
thoughif
you
have
not
used
systems
such
as
this
the
amount
of
features
and
the
skimpy
documentation
devoted
to
them
can
be
pretty
baffling
this
is
definitely
not
system
for
the
first
time
doityourselfer
if
you
are
willing
to
spend
lot
of
time
to
figure
things
out
on
your
own
it
may
be
worth
it
for
you
though
if
you
are
looking
for
much
simpler
system
with
better
documentation
you
would
be
better
off
going
with
system
from
harbor
freight
or
costco
than
this
one
if
you
know
exactly
what
you
are
doing
and
are
willing
to
put
the
extra
work
in
this
system
is
pretty
good
deal
though
it
five
megapixel
system
and
it
pleasure
to
watch
the
vividly
clear
picture
is
awesome
it
took
bit
to
install
but
ve
done
few
so
knowing
little
helped
lot
the
receiver
is
five
megapixel
also
you
can
have
lesser
megapixel
cameras
but
nothing
over
five
the
cables
were
long
enough
for
the
runs
wanted
the
security
features
are
current
and
up
to
date
the
receiver
came
with
the
one
terabyte
hard
drive
already
installed
it
capabilities
will
record
the
eight
cameras
for
quite
awhile
the
eight
cameras
are
metal
and
are
waterproof
it
is
well
thought
out
security
system
with
wanted
features
the
clear
video
just
blows
me
away
four
stars
⭐

⭐
⭐
we
have
used
plethora
of
cheap
wireless
security
cams
and
can
say
that
if
you
are
considering
between
this
system
or
few
wireless
cams
would
go
with
this
system
setting
it
up
is
not
as
easy,
the
instructions
are
pretty
helpful
but
not
perfect
so
it
takes
bit
of
messing
around
and
online
research
to
get
everything
fully
set
up
and
figure
out
how
to
make
use
of
all
the
features
getting
everything
wired
up
also
takes
bit
of
time
as
you
need
to
find
out
way
to
hide
the
wires
while
still
being
efficient
with
how
much
wiring
you
use
however
after
the
initial
set
up
phase
everything
is
frictionless
the
quality
of
the
day
light
and
night
time
videos
are
great,
the
cameras
feel
sturdy
and
have
yet
to
have
any
problems
with
them
can
easily
cover
all
my
entrances
and
main
rooms
which
gives
me
peace
of
mind
the
app
is
also
really
nice
since
the
menus
from
the
dvr
are
not
great
but
the
app
makes
the
basic
recording
and
other
features
much
easier
overall
its
great
system
this
is
an
outstanding
channel
security
system
camera
it
is
easy
to
install
and
use,
it
has
good
quality,
good
night
vision,
and
breeze
to
replay
video
it
the
best
value
found
for
an
camera
system
the
camera
clarity
is
excellent
for
the
price,
those
cameras
working
great,
way
better
than
expected
the
camera
quality
is
better
than
my
old
security
systemdon
let
somebody
break
into
your
vehicles
or
your
home
when
you're
not
at
home
or
sleeping
the
mobile
application
is
amazing
while
at
work
or
school,
can
even
watch
it
on
my
phone
and
the
quality
is
amazing,
you
will
be
satisfied
the
recording
software
is
extremely
customizable,
your
able
to
go
into
the
settings
of
each
camera
and
set
if
you
want
continuous
recording
or
motion
detection
recording
your
able
to
program
it
to
be
different
at
different
times
of
the
day
or
set
holiday
schedule
the
cameras
themselves
are
simple
to
install
but
the
are
fully
wired
and
do
have
to
be
plugged
into
the
dvr
box
so
it
does
involve
running
lots
of
cables
and
hiding
them
we
live
in
rural
area
where
internet
isn
available
so
system
that
didn
require
internet
was
must,
but
you
are
able
to
set
up
internet
access
if
you
do
have
home
internet
so
you
can
view
them
when
your
away
this
new
system
that
annke
is
developing
with
this
package
are
vastly
improved
from
previous
models
these
new
cameras,
that
are
unfortunately
static
cameras,
have
much
higher
video
quality
being
5mp
the
kit
will
come
with
everything
you
will
need
to
set
the
cameras
up
and
if
you
do
any
general
work
on
your
house,
you
should
not
have
any
problems
setting
the
cameras
up
the
hardest
part
for
me
was
finding
the
best
places
to
mount
them
but
with
cameras
my
house
looks
like
guarding
the
hope
diamond
now
overall
am
very
impressed
with
the
quality
of
the
cameras
and
the
total
set
the
cameras
are
durable
metal
material
and
can
last
through
any
weather
the
dvr
has
also
been
working
great
and
has
not
given
me
any
problems
so
far
great
product
impressed
with
the
quality
of
the
images
during
both
the
day
and
night
the
2mp
cameras
are
clearer
than
other
security
cameras
that
have
owned
in
the
past
and
better
than
most
have
researched
on
the
market
at
the
momentthe
app
is
great
for
realtime
alerts
never
miss
anything
when
we
are
away
from
home
it
makes
for
safer
feeling
home,
both
when
we
are
there
or
at
work
and
out
and
aboutthe
cameras
are
made
for
outdoors
and
have
withstood
some
extreme
weather
since
we
have
purchased
it,
including
heavy
rain
and
coldi
happy
with
this
security
system
love
the
peace
of
mind
in
having
24/7
security
installed
this
at
my
families
house
to
keep
watch
over
the
house
after
we
had
break
in
this
system
has
been
very
dependable
so
far
despite
the
low
price
at
time
of
review;
this
system
really
does
deliver
in
quality
and
performancepros
semi
fast
dvr;
it
only
takes
few
seconds
to

depending
on
how

the
cars
are

dvr
lasts
many

with
48

areas;
was
able
to
setup
alerts
on
different
camera
channels
that
activate
based
on
motion
to
send
me
alerts
this
works
well
although
it
does
pick
up
trees
moving
so
ymmv
depending
on
how
your
yard
is
easy
install;
the
cameras
require
basically
plugs
each
and
the
lines
are
super
light
and
easy
to
work
with
we
had
no
problems
running
the
lines
around
the
house
in
the
roof

to
hide
them
cameras

when

physical

clunky
translation
of

isn't
the
greatest
some
things
you
have
to
really
think
about
what
their
translation
is
trying
to
say
the
cables
aren't
all
long
enough
for
smaller
1250sq
foot
house
you
might
need
some
longer
ones
depending
on
how
big
your
house
is
considering
there
are
channels;
it
makes
the
need
for
longer
cables
all
that
much
greaterall
in
all
this
is
pretty
nice
dvr
setup
with
good
resolution,
performance
and
features
really
cannot
complain
too
much
about
it
and
so
far
its
done
its
job
well
if
you
are
looking
for
an
affordable
solid
dvr
system
then
this
deserves
real
lookif
this
review
helped
you
at
all;
please
mark
it
helpful
thanks
this
was
an
easy
system
to
install
replaced
my
old
cam
system
with
this
and
had
some
prior
knowledge
which
was
helpful
if
you've
never
done
this
before
you
can
probably
do
this
on
your
own
but
it
doesn't
hurt
to
have
someone
to
help
you
with
hiding
wires
and
trouble
shooting
like
the
clarity
of
the
cameras
and
the
night
vision
will
caution
you
to
cover
your
outside
wires
if
you
have
squirrels
because
they
will
chew
these
it
took
about
days
to
fully
install
and
set
this
up
as
with
any
camera
system,
the
slowest
part
is
getting
the
wires
to
the
cameraonce
set
up,
it
is
very
good
it
records
what
it
should,
good
night
vision
very
clear,
if
you
know
the
person,
you
will
easily
recognize
them
from
the
footagethe
only
disappointment
is
the
app
it's
not
easy
to
use
or
to
set
up
and
that
is
shame
it's
not
often
watch
this
through
the
tv,
but
wherever
am
in
the
house,
have
my
phoneideally,
you
will
want
to
have
friend
help
you
install
this,
pulling
wires
is
easier
with
two
i'll
start
off
by
saying
that
the
cables
that
come
with
the
kit
are
actually
pretty
nice
unfortunately
that's
the
end
of
my
praise
for
the
kitthe
cameras
are
mediocre
quality
would
say
they
are
probably
worth
about
$25$30
each,
which
is
consistent
with
what
you
can
find
the
individual
cameras
selling
forthe
reason
this
kit
ranks
so
low
for
me
is
the
nvr
it's
total
garbage
having
builtin
poe
switch
is
nice,
but
that's
about
the
height
of
it's
value
the
hard
drive
in
the
unit
sounds
like
newoldstock
from
from
2009
wasn't
sure
if
it
was
failing
or
just
junk,
and
didn't
bother
taking
off
the
cover
to
find
outhardware
aside,
the
software
is
an
absolute
travesty
the
nvr
apparently
doesn't
support
keyboards
don't
know
how
they
accomplished
this,
but
it
makes
setup
incredibly
painful
with
setup
complete
attempted
to
log
into
the
web
interface,
only
to
be
met
with
constant
errors
that
made
no
sense
due
to
poor
translation
decided
to
upgrade
the
firmware,
which
lead
to
total
lockout
of
the
web
interface
and
redirect
to
download
and
install
some
software
from
third
party
no
way
in
hell
i'm
doing
that
the
mobile
app,
xmeye,
is
the
key
component
named
in
the
article
"naming
&
shaming
web
polluters"
the
application
trades
security
for
convenience,
and
resulted
in
the
creation
of
the
mirai
botnetover
all,
the
only
reason
this
thing
gets
instead
of
1,
is
that
this
kit
will
work
if
your
requirements
are;i
can
plug
cameras
into
the
boxi
can
watch
the
feed
on
tv
plugged
into
the
boxit
will
record
videoi
can
transfer
recordings
to
usb
stick
to
give
to
the
policeoutside
of
that,
even
connecting
this
thing
to
your
network/internet
would
be
massive
mistake
installing
their
software
would
be
adding
insult
to
injury
if
you
want
solution
that
you
can
monitor
remotely,
this
is
not
the
one
the
system
was
easy
to
install
but
unsuccessful
to
implement
and
run
at
this
point
we
are
unable
to
obtain
wireless
connection
to
the
device
for
out
of
home
view
of
security
systems
overall,
it's
an
ok
security
system
given
the
low
cost
but
not
super
happy
with
it
options
for
live
viewing
are
very
limited
but
the
main
bad
point
is
the
brain
of
the
system,
ie
the
main
box,
is
soooo
loud
it
drives
me
crazy
from
20ft
away
after
one
month,
it's
safe
to
say
that
would
not
recommend
this
system
too
many
false
alerts
and
yes
adjusted
it
several
times,
notifications
but
no
playbacks,
issues
with
the
mobile
app
playbacks,
hard
to
navigate
interface,
and
the
worst
part
of
it
all,
when
i'm
watching
it
live,
can
literally
see
car
or
people
passing
by
right
in
front
of
the
camera
but
the
system
does
not
start
recording
or
send
me
motion
detected
notification
that
defeats
the
whole
purpose
of
buying
camera
aystemand
good
luck
trying
to
reach
tech
supportoverall,
if
you
want
to
live
record
all
the
time
and
be
reactive
when
there
is
security
problem
rather
than
proactive,
get
this
system
otherwise,
invest
in
something
