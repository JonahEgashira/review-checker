video
the
unboxing
experience
was
very
pleasant
the
branding
is
very
good,
everything
is
wrapped
individually
in
the
box
is
the
power
bank,
mesh
bag,
micro
usb
cable,
the
instruction
booklet
and
nice
surprise;
small
bendy
usb
reading
lamp
as
you
can
see
from
the
pictures,
the
iniu
branding
is
quite
strong
and
everything
comes
across
as
good
qualitythe
power
bank
itself
is
quite
weighty
it
has
lot
of
battery
in
it
and
feels
very
solid,
and
has
smooth,
matt
softtouch
exterior
it
feels
wonderful,
the
build
quality
is
very
goodthe
paw
print
feature
is
very
cute
but
also
functional
when
charging
device,
it
shows
the
current
state
of
charge
of
the
power
bank
by
flashing
the
appropriate
toe
when
the
power
bank
itself
is
being
charged,
you
get
cute
animation
as
it
charges
see
video
very
useful,
and
also
cutethe
small
led
torch
on
the
end
is
activated
by
doubleclicking
the
small
power
button
on
the
side
it
bright
enough
to,
for
example,
see
where
you
re
going
in
the
dark,
but
not
to
read
with
the
separate
plugin
reading
lamp
is
much
brighter
and
will
come
in
handy
when
campingthe
power
bank
charges
with
either
micro
usb
or
usbc
cable,
so
for
android
users,
there
is
no
need
to
use
different
cable
to
the
one
you
already
use
to
charge
your
phone
charging
speed
when
charging
device
seems
very
good
it
charges
my
iphone
plus
and
ipad
as
quickly
if
not
quicker
than
my
apple
mains
charger
does
it
basically
works
exactly
as
it
should,
no
fussin
summary
then,
this
is
well
made,
good
value,
premiumfeel
power
bank
that
works
exactly
as
it
should,
and
with
bit
of
flair
really
like
it
an
excellent
product,
very
nice
was
in
need
of
power
bank
that
could
handle
couple
of
days
of
use
without
needing
to
be
recharged
that
would
keep
me
topped
up
as
travelledthe
iniu
seemed
good
choice,
similar
pricing
that
of
anker
i've
used
before
the
unit
itself
arrived
in
small
box,
designed
for
the
item,
with
usb
charger
cable
and
free
usb
plug
in
reading
light
which
was
nice
touchat
0,0
mah,
this
should
charge
0mah
typical
smartphone
battery
times
before
it
needs
to
be
recharged
itselfthe
unit
comes
with
small
built
in
white
flash
light
as
well
which
can
be
useful
on
occasions
the
blue
light
on
the
front
represents
how
much
charge
it
has
its
shaped
like
paw
which
could
be
nice
specifically
for
pet
owners
to
me
it
was
nice
touch
but
not
essential
this
is
more
down
to
personal
preferencethe
material
case
with
drawstring
is
handy
to
keep
it
protected
from
accidental
damage
also
like
the
inclusion
of
usbc
charging
this
is
something
i've
found
more
and
more
common,
in
cars,
phones
and
finally
battery
packs
if
you
already
have
usb
or
micro
usb,
you
can
charge
this
with
your
choice
of
connectionoverall
the
battery
pack
has
performed
well
and
feels
solidly
built
would
be
happy
to
recommend
this
model
to
friends
very
good
quality
product,
the
light
isn't
the
absolute
best
but
guess
it's
more
of
backup
thing
than
main
thing
to
use
the
foot
print
makes
this
look
amazing
as
it
lights
up
in
blue
the
casing
is
like
dry
matt
finish
which
feels
grippy
which
is
good
the
powerbank
holds
lot
of
power
and
charges
well
it
came
with
nice
carry
case
which
is
nice
to
have
and
stops
it
getting
scratched
on
travels
not
that
this
would
affect
use
in
any
way
at
all
now
this
company
that
makes
these
batterries
take
service
to
new
limit
wow
the
first
one
arrived
faulty
and
not
working
and
on
contacting
them
they
did
not
argue
or
give
me
hard
time
at
all
the
new
one
arrived
in
the
post
and
to
boot
was
given
it
for
free
for
the
inconvenience
created
need
say
morethe
product
arrived
well
boxed
and
wrapped
in
its
own
sealed
bag
the
accessories
supplied
with
the
lamp
and
bag
for
free,
nice
touch
have
tested
extensively
over
the
last
week
to
see
how
this
little
beast
performs
and
oh
it
does
the
paw
print
showing
discharge
rate
and
charge
rate
is
brilliant
and
nice
touch
the
grip
of
the
unit
is
great,
not
to
big
and
the
vulcanising
on
the
outer
shell
is
great
for
non
slip
grip
and
looks
elegant
guys
this
company
went
up
and
beyond
to
sort
my
query
out,
best
service
have
had
in
many
years
hats
off
and
well
done
inui
this
is
decent
power
bank
it's
really
small
and
lightweight,
just
about
perfect
size
to
carry
in
pocket
probably
my
favorite
feature
is
you
have
two
ports
for
charging
the
power
bank
itself,
one
microusb
port,
and
one
usbc
the
newer
flat
one,
which
is
brilliant
because
the
one
cable
you
have
with
you
is
usually
the
wrong
one
the
bank
feels
really
high
quality
with
smooth
texture
finish
which
makes
it
really
easy
to
hold
without
dropping,
and
it
feels
nice
love
the
pawprint
in
the
corner
which
lights
up
to
show
how
much
power
you
have
left,
it's
cute
and
has
more
personality
than
blinking
lightsit
has
built
in
flashlight
which
is
useful
although
it
doesn't
look
waterproof
so
be
careful
if
you're
taking
it
camping,
and
comes
with
free
plugin
usb
desk/reading
light,
which
is
nice
touch
:my
only
issue
so
far
is
i'm
not
sure
about
the
capacity,
it
seems
to
run
down
quicker
than
i'd
expect
from
0mah
power
pack,
i've
had
similar
ones
that
have
lasted
what
feels
like
twice
as
long
from
full
chargeoverall
not
bad
product,
like
the
look
and
feel
especially,
but
i'm
not
sure
about
the
0mah
rating,
feels
more
like
0mah
:/
updatefurther
to
my
earlier
review
where
gave
this
powerbank
stars
due
it
it
only
having
0mah
output
despite
being
0mah
unit,
was
contacted
by
iniu
and
given
an
explanation
as
to
why
this
is
so
it
seems
that
no
matter
what
brand
powerbank
you
buy,
its
output
will
only
be
approx
0%
of
its
capacity
which
was
unaware
ofto
make
amends
for
this,
felt
it
only
fair
to
regrade
this
product
to
stars
it
came
in
one
day
thanks
to
prime
so
iv
already
put
this
in
to
use
over
the
holiday
period
first
off
the
bat
notice
the
quality
in
this
product
take
lot
of
camping
trips
and
road
trips
so
have
been
looking
for
study
battery
pack
that
will
see
me
though
the
times
that
am
not
connected
to
the
mains
the
packaging
was
really
lovely
and
it
had
nice
touch
of
free
soft
cloth
bag
and
free
usb
light
which
will
do
wonders
for
my
camping
adventures
rlly
chuffed
the
paw
print
design
is
really
cute
also
powerbank
arrived
with
0%
charge
and
ready
to
go
it
is
lil
heavy
but
that
will
take
the
added
weight
for
the
fact
it
charges
rlly
fast
and
stores
lot
of
battery
its
very
good
charger
feels
top
quality
it
is
not
fast
charger
but
still
charges
in
reasonable
time
i'm
using
s0plus
and
used
the
charger
timesfirst
charge
0%
second
charge
0%
third
charge
0%the
powerbank
started
at
0%
and
was
still
flashing
on
the
0%
mark
and
im
continuing
to
charge
my
phone
untill
the
bank
is
dead
this
should
give
me
an
idea
of
how
long
can
go
away
from
the
grid
the
charger
doesn't
turn
off
when
the
phone
is
fully
chargedits
says
you
can
use
charging
cables
to
charge
it
but
the
cables
have
are
too
thick
to
do
thisthe
bank
came
with
0%
charge
so
not
too
badthis
is
my
first
power
bank
have
had
so
got
no
reference
to
compare
it
normaly
use
battery
case
when
go
away
for
weekendsi
would
recommend
this
product
with
the
little
time
have
had
with
it
for
the
value
as
its
cheap
also
comes
with
usb
light
been
on
the
lookout
for
reasonably
priced
good
power
bank
for
while
when
saw
this
one
decided
to
take
the
plunge
and
am
not
disappointed
use
an
iphone
xr
and
have
charged
this
from
less
than
0%
to
fully
charged
times,
think
may
have
gotten
another
full
charge
out
of
this
power
bank
but
decided
to
recharge
it
without
going
for
charge
no
the
casing
on
the
power
bank
feels
really
nice
to
touch
soft
but
with
enough
grip
so
it
won
slip
out
of
your
fingers
handy
little
drawstring
pouch
is
included
in
the
box
too,
the
leads
also
come
complete
with
handy
little
dust
covers
for
the
usb/type
connectorswhat
really
like
is
both
dual
input
and
output,
good
idea
but
the
piece
de
resistance
for
me
is
the
brilliant
bendy
superbright
led
usb
light
included
in
the
box,
it
superb,
much
brighter
than
torch
on
your
phone
if
like
me
you
re
fisherman
who
always
likes
to
get
that
last
cast
in
before
it
goes
dark
and
inevitably
finish
up
your
tackling
down
in
the
dark,
this
usb
light
is
godsend
bought
this
to
keep
my
samsung
s0
charged
up
whilst
fishing
weekends
have
used
it
couple
of
times
and
am
impressed
with
the
speed
it
charges
and
also
how
much
charge
it
holdsi
tested
this
with
0%
battery
remaining
wall
socket
samsung
charger
was
minutes
the
power
pack
minutes
it
charges
my
phone
from
dead
in
hours
this
is
about
0:0
on
my
wall
charger
so,
not
really
much
in
it
in
terms
of
speed
which
is
good
newsit
charged
my
phone
times
with
bit
left
over
so
perfect
for
weekend
comes
with
sperate
light
that
you
can
plug
into
usb
socketand
also
has
light
on
the
unit
itself
which
again
is
handy
when
travelling
if
you're
travelling
or
have
batteryhungry
phone,
this
is
the
power
bank
for
youthe
power
bank
is
quite
large,
however
that
is
to
be
expected
with
such
powerful
device
the
manufacturer
has
clearly
attempted
to
keep
it
as
compact
as
possibleas
far
as
power
banks
go,
if
you're
after
0,0
mah
one,
this
is
the
choice
for
you
pros
easy
to
use,
battery
life
is
good,
have
used
it
times
and
still
has
some

little
light
on
it
so
can
be
used
as

be
charged

this
product
in
particular
rate
one
of
the
best
power
banks
that
ve
ever
had
0,0
mah
for
the
following
reasons
:firstly
the
battery
percentage
indicator
is
very
aesthetically
pleasing
due
to
the
flashing
video
attached
from
the
paw
which
find
very
sweetsecondly
the
size
of
this
power
bank
was
smaller
than
my
iphone
xrlastly
the
attention
to
detail
and
quality
they
have
invested
into
this
product
impresses
me
immensely,
from
the
smooth
feeling
of
the
power
bank
to
the
pouch
that
they
give
you,
the
usb
light,
the
usbc
and
mini
usb
ports,
the
paw
and
the
blue
lighting
all
really
impressed
me
initially
it
was
purchased
for
my
work
colleague
who
doesn
have
prime,
debates
keeping
it
in
the
end,
just
kept
the
light
as
ll
find
that
fairly
useful
when
working
on
my
carthe
powerbank
is
really
sleek
and
attractive
the
glowing
paw
print
is
very
unique
and
piqued
everyone
interest
within
our
officethe
power
bank
has
charged
her
s0
times
before
needing
another
charge
it
fits
in
her
handbag
nicely
and
she
reports
it
not
nuisance
to
carry
:all
in
all
very
happy,
and
believe
me
the
light
is
very
bright
this
is
great
little
charger
bought
for
me
and
my
kid
to
use
during
pokemon
go
fest
day
they
kept
the
phones
easily
fully
charged
all
day
without
any
problems
and
at
the
end
of
the
day
still
had
about
half
the
battery
left
there
is
little
paw
shaped
battery
indicator
consising
of
lights
that
are
ully
lit
when
full
and
go
off
by
one
when
the
battery
is
draining
have
bought
similar
priced
ones
but
not
as
good
as
these
great
for
camping
or
being
anywhere
without
power
purchased
this
for
when
went
camping
in
wales
it
was
really
handy
comes
with
light
on
the
unit
amd
spare
bendy
light
you
can
plug
in
via
the
usb
port
the
paw
print
is
nice
touch,
as
the
toes
show
how
much
charge
is
left
it
is
quite
heavy
but
dont
have
any
others
so
cant
say
if
thats
normal
or
not
it
also
comes
with
little
bag
to
store
it
in
over
all
am
very
haply
with
it
great
back
up
for
peace
of
mind
we
get
power
cuts
fairly
often,
as
live
in
rural
area
with
overhead
cables
also
handy
in
hospital
if
find
myself
taken
in
unexpectedly,
without
my
charger
very
heavy
compared
to
the
0mah
one
got
for
friend
if
you
don't
want
to
add
lot
of
weight
to
your
handbag,
maybe
get
the
lighter
one
to
take
out
&
about
which
is
what
plan
to
do
needed
power
bank
because
have
many
devices
to
charge,
eg
bluetooth
earphones,
bluetooth
speaker,
cigarette,
two
phones
sometimes
it's
hard
to
find
that
many
plugs
to
charge
everything
at
once
so
chose
this
power
bank
due
to
very
positive
feedback's
and
wasn't
disappointed
at
all
it
came
neatly
packed,
with
all
needed
bits
the
power
bank
is
heavy
itself
which
is
showing
perfect
quality
of
it
it
has
funny
pawn
which
indicates
how
much
battery
is
left,
also
it
has
flashlight
in
the
package
there
was
also
included
gift
which
was
reading
light,
very
bright
by
the
way,
and
very
good
for
me
as
like
reading
books
also
there
was
very
lovely
and
soft
case
for
your
power
bank,
very
comfy
and
good
quality
as
well
the
charger
is
included
of
course
there
is
also
an
instruction
sheet,
but
not
very
necessary
as
this
device
is
too
easy
to
use,
you
don't
even
need
to
turn
it
on,
you
just
plug
something
you
need
to
charge
and
it's
on
automatically
how
cool
is
that
so
highly
recommend
this
product
for
those
who
needs
some
extra
energy
received
this
product
just
as
was
about
to
go
away
for
the
weekend
therefore
was
not
able
to
charge
to
full
capacity
before
lefthowever
on
opening
the
package,
found
the
unit
itself,
pouch
to
keep
it
in,
micro
usb
and
usb
charging
cable
as
an
unexpected
surprise
there
is
also
usb
lamp
included
in
the
package,
wow
wasn't
expecting
thatthe
unit
itself
appears
be
very
well
made
and
did
not
suffer
after
dropped
it
whilst
in
the
pouchthe
good
point
is
that
whilst
was
away
from
the
single
charge
which
had
not
been
topped
up
was
able
to
charge
the
following
devices
completelyiphone
0+
0mahhuawei
mate

predator

also
had
the
opportunity
to
use
the
free
torch,
which
is
superbright
and
very
usefulthe
ability
to
charge
devices
at
once
is
bonuson
my
return
home
the
unit
still
had
section
left
on
the
chargebad
points
really
nonewould
recommend
to
other
people,
at
the
price
and
the
capacity,
would
heartily
recommend
to
everyone
new
brand
on
the
scene
just
started
using
their
power
bank
because
it
was
reasonably
priced
so
far
i've
used
this
to
charge
my
huawei
and
iphone,
it
seems
to
charge
both
without
an
issue
the
power
bank
has
rubber
coating
feel
to
it
and
doesn't
slip
out
of
the
hands
as
easy
i've
previously
had
anker
ones
which
were
shiny
but
slips
easily
when
carrying
aroundthe
light
that
it
comes
with,
is
more
useful
when
trying
to
read
in
low
lit
area
absolutely
love
this
it
can
charge
my
phone
about
four
times
plusit
does
take
long
time
to
charge
once
it
down
and
do
try
to
de
charge
it
so
it
can
have
good
charge
if
honest
was
looking
for
another
power
bank
and
then
saw
this
and
because
of
the
paw
print
it
swung
it
for
me
but
not
disappointed
it
amazing
decided
to
go
for
this
powerbank
due
to
its
price,
capacity
and
extra
features
it
looks
great
and
is
quite
compact
for
0,0
mah
portable
charger
think
it
is
smaller
than
average
as
my
brother
has
one
with
the
same
output
but
it
is
bit
longer
that
this
one
the
light
up
paws
is
great
to
track
what
percentage
the
bank
is
on,
which
is
feature
lot
of
power
banks
do
not
have
charging
is
great
and
charges
just
as
fast
as
from
plug
socket
the
added
usb
light
was
reason
why
bought
this
product,
it
is

wasn
to
send
this
one
back
or
gift
card
by
way
of
compensationi
took
the
gift
card,
no
way
was
going
to
leave
the
seller
any
more
out
of
pocket
as
they
were
extremely
polite
and
easy
to
deal
with
brilliant
powerbank
looks
lovely
and
holds
charge
for
ages
used
it
travelling
by
train
and
it
more
than
did
the
job
with
lots
of
charge
left
love
the
pouch
it
came
in
protects
between
usages
so
glad
got
this
model
recommended
stars
all
the
way*****
am
yet
to
test
it
out
but
will
be
soon
so
far
so
good
nice
power
bank,
slightly
heavy
come
with
usb
bendy
light
which
really

and
pounch
to
store

all
in
happy
at
present
being
day
one
of
recieveing
it
will
update
when
know
more
this
can
charge
my
iphone
and
ipad
several
times
over,
and
doesn
notice
charging
my
sports
watch
it
heavy
to
carry
around
but
worth
the
effort
use
it
to
keep
stuff
charged
whilst
working
on
my
allotment,
where
there
is
no
electricity
great
charger
for
phones
and
tablets
etc
the
paw
lights
up
to
tell
you
how
may
he
charge
is
left
in
it
but
the
best
bit
is
two
usb
outputs
so
two
gadgets
can
be
charged
at
the
same
time
great
when
you
got
kidsonly
minor
criticism
is
that
it
little
bit
heavy
but
still
lighter
than
carrying
two
so
still
winner
for
mecomes
well
packaged
with
usb
charging
cable,
little
bag
and
usb
light
nice
touch
excellent
product,
does
exactly
what
it
says
on
the
tin
can
use
my
phone
on
hot
spot
and
take
loads
of
photos
and
can
reply
of
not
running
out
of
battery
because
of
this
perfect
on
long
weekend
camping
trip
as
it
comes
with
small
led
light
which
can
be
used
as
torch
but
also
usb
reading
light
which
is
actually
really
bright
quite
impressed
with
this,
it
feels
good
in
your
hand
and
us
obviously
we'll
put
togethercomes
with
cool
little
usb
led
light
that
is
nice
and
brightyou
can
charge
it
with
new
usb
or
the
older
micro
usb
ditched
my
old
powerbank
as
could
only
charge
it
with
the
older
micro
usball
in
all
would
recommend
bought
for
weekend
away
where
had
no
access
to
an
electrical
outlet
this
charger
was
perfect
for
the
job
and
kept
one
phone
and
two
ipads
charged
love
the
paw
print
indicator
showing
how
much
charge
remains
had
replacement
power
bank
due
to
the
first
one
didn
charge
correctly
contacted
the
seller
and
had
great
customer
service
as
had
another
one
in
the
post
in
days
working
great
how
great
power
bank
as
use
lodes
of
it
up
my
garden
charging
phone,
ipad
and
kindle
fantastic
item
and
great
value
for
money
the
device
comes
with
protective
pouch,usb
cable,usb
torch
which
is
really
bright
would
definitely
recommend
this
product
to
everyone
what
fantastic
powerbank
this
is
it
nice
weight
for
0,0
love
the
paw
print
to
tell
you
how
much
battery
is
available
they
even
included
free
usb
torch
and
carry
case
couldn
recommend
this
highly
enough
this
is
unbelievably
powerful,
use
it
primarily
for
my
portable
reloop
spin
turntable,
used
on
daily
basis
it
powers
it
for
easily
uptown
month
without
recharging,
sometimes
if
wall
charger
is
not
to
hand
i'll
charge
my
phone
and
tablet
at
the
same
time,
which
this
power
bank
manages
with
easei
highly
recommend
this
as
it's
cheaper
and
lot
more
powerful
than
lot
of
power
banks
currently
on
the
market
and
is
ideal
for
travelling
due
to
it's
pretty
slim
size
have
so
many
battery
packs
it's
mad
use
them
for
so
many
things
what
was
really
nice
though
was
this
came
with
usb
book
light
thing,
which
was
really
bright,
no
idea
what
i'll
do
with
it
but
was
nice
extra
your
browser
does
not
support
html0
video
nice
power
bank
on
the
heavy
side
so
so
good
for
bag
rather
than
in
pocket
will
charge
devices
at
once
this
will
be
great
once
festival
season
starts
in
the
summeri
also
like
the
paw
that
lights
up
when
fully
charged
and
decreased
lights
when
power
starts
to
drop
this
is
chunky
power
pack
that
now
lives
in
my
sons
school
bag
so
that
he
and
all
his
friends
can
charge
their
phones
on
the
busreally
good
price
and
great
itemwould
buy
again
product
housing
is
very
sturdy
and
has
great
rubber
finish
it
is
bit
heavy
but
this
you
would
expect
from
0amp
battery
and
it
comes
with
free
usb
torch
light
great
value
for
the
money
spent
stars
good
product,
handy
light
attachment
included
clear
light
meter
telling
you
how
much
power
is
left
in
the
battery
charges
quickly
and
feels
like
quality
product,
even
comes
with
carrying
pouch
would
buy
another
ive
been
traveling
lot
these
last
few
weeks
and
needed
decent
sized
powerbank
love
the
fact
this
one
comes
with
carry
case,
built
in
torch
and
reading
light
its
drcrbt
size
in
charge
and
charged
my
phone
pretty
nice
and
fast
heavy
duty,
charged
two
phones
from
virtually
empty
to
full
and
we
lost
one
bit
of
the
paw
print
takes
some
time
to
charge
back
up
but
feel
confident
we
will
get
several
phones
charges
from
this
bought
this
to
keep
in
my
handbag,
it
fully
charges
my
phone
about
0+half
times,
it's
quite
heavy
though
and
little
flash
light
comes
with
it
which
haven't
had
the
use
of
yetit's
great
to
keep
for
backup
for
your
phone
excellent
mobile
power
supply
for
my
raspberry
pi
computer
not
the
lightest
so
possibly
not
ideal
for
phone
top
up
but
that's
reasonable
sacrifice
for
the
increased
capacity
am
pleased
with
this
purchase
as
it
has
held
charge
well,
recharges
fast
enough
and
recharges
my
phone
well
light
has
been
used,
and
works
well
but
certainly
not
primary
use
bough
this
product
recently
and
is
amazing
it
last
lot
longer
then
expected
which
could
change
in
future
but
as
of
know
it
last
day
depending
or
how
much
use
it
it
also
come
with
light
which
you
can
plug
in
the
charger
which
kind
of
work
like
lamp
light
if
you
don't
wat
it
disturb
any
one
at
nigh
and
want
little
bit
of
light
in
the
room
or
anywhere
else
got
for
christmas
&
husband
loved
it
charges
really
fast
and
does
exactly
what
it
sayspaw
print
light
is
plus
as
he
works
with
dogswould
definitely
buy
another
love
these
gadgets
and
this
one
is
just
ideal
for
when
i'm
out
and
about
love
that
it
has
type
charge
too
so
can
recharge
it
fast
bit
on
the
heavy
side
but
it
has
the
power
so
it's
expected
had
about
three
full
charges
off
this
bad
boy
and
still
has
more
to
giverapid
charge
as
wellfaster
than
plugging
it
inprefect
for
weekend
campingi
just
have
it
in
the
car
and
use
it
most
days
as
back
up
very
good
value
but
not
the
lightest
for
traveling
iniu
has
lighter
but
lower
battery
power
model
which
is
more
travel
friendly
for
hand
baggage
included
cover
and
reading
light
are
very
good
and
quality
seems
great
so
far
most
chargers
buy,
last
over
day,
would
charge
on
the
evening
of
the
second
day
this
charger
does
not
even
last
one
full
day
therefore,
is
awful
for
travelling
or
anything
as
would
probably
run
out
within
half
day
if
using
it
frequently,
or
having
more
than
one
device
charging
at
time
it
was
ok
for
week
then
stopped
charging
,
left
it
in
charge
for
hours
and
still
not
fully
charged
have
sent
back
but
had
my
pay
for
postage
,
which
eventually
got
refund
for
wouldn
recommend
looks
lovely,
feels
solid
not
over
heavy
but
you
will
know
you
have
it
in
your
bag
bought
for
0mile
charity
walk
so
was
even
more
pleased
with
the
extra
torch
really
good
quality
build
power
bank
charges
an
iphone
to
full
charge
and
the
power
bank
still
has
like
bars
left
of
charge
great
power
bank
for
its
price
highly
recommended
just
arrived
today
seems
like
well
made
bit
of
kit
it's
heavy
but
has
protective
pouch
with
string
like
the
fact
you
can
charge
it
with
both
micro
usb
and
usb
type
going
on
holiday
in
few
weeks
will
update
then
brought
of
these
for
my
children
and
they
say
they
are
great
i've
not
heard
them
scream
"i
need
charger,
quickly"
since
brought
it
this
was
present
for
my
mum
she
loves
it
especially
the
cute
paw
print
design
it
not
very
very
light
but
that
isn
problem
wouldn
say
it
heavy
but
heavier
than
phone
it
works
well
and
can
charge
things
at
once
it
doesn
charge
ipads
as
quick
as
the
chargers
that
come
with
them
but
that
is
to
be
expected
really
great
value
and
great
quality
product
would
really
recommend
and
it
comes
with
free
light
which
is
really
bright
for
the
fair
price
you
receive
great
product
with
great
design
and
an
impressive
mah
capacity

the
money

extremely
well
and
light
can
come
in
handy
when

reasonably
bulky
you
wouldn't
want
to
carry
it
around
in
your
pocket
but
providing
you're
okay
with
shoving
it
in
rucksack
or
car

you
won't

and
you

so
no

like

power

nice
product
and
seems
to
work
well
we
ve
used
it
little
but
great
for
our
last
camping
trip
recommend
when
this
arrived
the
packaging
was
very
good
and
also
it
was
already
charged
to
full
so
used
this
straight
away
the
item
is
quite
heavy
yet
does
the
job,
if
you
have
samsung
s0
you
would
have
to
get
your
own
cable
,
the
cable
supplied
will
not
fit
samsung
s0
or
huwaei
p0
pro
excellent
for
traveling
this
is
great
external
battery
and
goes
with
me
on
just
about
every
trip
it
is
very
durable
and
fulfils
my
requirements
this
power
bank
really
holds
its
charge
well,
once
charged
up
i'm
not
certain
exactly
how
long
my
iniu
power
bank
has
run
for,
but
it
has
proven
to
be
really
useful,
swiftcharging,
longrunning,
mighty
charger
at
approx
0g,
its
weighty
for
the
handbag/purse
but
not
an
issue
for
shoulder
bag/
backpack
looks
great
and
packaged
well
fingers
crossed
it
works
well
will
find
out
at
christmas
great
customer
servicecontacted
me
within
days
and
new
replacement
was
received
in
two
days
also
notice
the
cable
not
working,
also
received
earlier
than
expectedpower
bank
work
very
well
excellent
device
but
disappointed
had
to
buy
another
connector
for
my
phone
for
the
price
multi
connector
would
have
been
useful
very
good
portable
power
bank
always
use
this
great
device
while
being
in
the
out
transport,
travelling
by
bus
or
being
at
work
without
the
connection
to
power
outlets
also
comes
with
built
in
flash
light
which
tends
to
be
really
useful
and
handy
at
times
recommend
it
strongly
its
nice
but
too
heavy
but
the
company
responded
me
after
few
weeks
and
thry
send
me
the
lighter
one
and
uts
completely
good
they
give
response
professionally
and
really
happy
with
its
definitely
says
can
buy
items
from
them
it
good
power
bank,
we
use
it
for
number
of
things,
can
believe
how
long
the
charge
lasts
great
power
bank
can
get
about
five
charges
for
my
iphone
out
of
it
perfect
by
far
one
of
my
favorite
things
to
have
in
my
bag
it
has
saved
me
many
times,
especially
not
to
die
of
boredom
with
my
laptop
of
phone's
batteries
going
outit's
sturdy,
lasts
for
long
time
and
it
was
by
far
one
of
the
best
purchases
made
pretty
much
does
what
it
says
on
the
tin
and
came
with
free
led
plug
in
light,
not
massively
useful
but
nice
freebie
that
was
not
aware
of
brilliant
little
power
bank
that
can
be
used
for
charging
mobile
phones
,
ear
phones
,
kindle
etc
etc
it
charges
quickly
and
holds
plenty
charge
itself
,
comes
in
handy
carrying
bag
and
feels
really
well
made
recently
received
this
power
bank
and
it
does
what
it
says
can
easily
charge
my
phone
on
the
go
for
now
while
am
at
work,
waiting
for
better
times
to
use
it
while
traveling
very
good
charger
has
bit
of
weight
but
you
don't
notice
it
soon
after
perfect
for
road
trips
or
in
case
of
blackout
handy
to
have
very
useful
but
if
kit,
well
made
and
can
power/recharge
many
different
types
of
power
hungry
devices
worth
the
money
after
buying
this
item
in
july
expected
it
to
last
at
least
months
however
months
later
have
useless
power

even
charge
up
never
mind
be

review
of
this
product
soon
wow
it
was
good
for
two
weeks
now
won
charge
and
making
sounds
it's
very
heavy
device
compared
to
previous
ones
had
it's
charges
faster
than
any
of
the
ones
i've
tried
before
and
it's
the
most
stylish
one
have
had
or
seen
delivery
was
on
time
and
no
damage
what
so
ever
i'm
very
happy
with
this
charger
big
but
great
and
powerful
amazing
value
for
money
this
has
to
be
one
of
the
best
powerbank
charges
available
especially
at
this
price
only
thing
annoying
is
that
there
is
no
percentage
number
of
charge
left
but
the
carry
case
is
great
to
avoid
scratches
and
it
charges
up
quick
very
good
would
recommend
fantastic
battery
life,
charges
over
and
over
for
samsung
galaxy
s0
plus
could
last
for
days,
which
makes
it
ideal
for
travel
loads
of
power
heavy
and
solid
exactly
as
described

pictured,

and
two
usb
outputs
very
lightexcelent
tourch
and
awesome
light
for
reading
while
camping
etc
turned
out
perfect,
exactly
what
was
looking
for
love
the
extra
features
of
the
lights
and
the
feature
showing
how
much
charge
is
remaining
use
the
powerbank
regularly
and
it
better
than
hopedit
doesn't
take
long
to
charge
my
reader
,tablet
etcvery
good
value
does
what
it
is
supposed
to
with
ease
quick
to
charge
up
and
lasts
slightly
heavier
than
expected
but
so
far
so
good
incredible
charger
by
far
the
best
ve
ever
had
ve
tried
far
more
expensive
ones,
buy
this
one
beats
them
all
this
is
priced
very
reasonably
and
worth
every
penny
with
such
high
capacity
naturally
it's
bulkier
than
the
0mah
one
which
we
also
boughtcomes
nicely
packed
and
the
light
is
nice
touchawesomeness
seller
too
very
happy
with
it
actually
order
another
one
slim
very
nice
with
the
blue
pow
witch
shows
the
remaining
battery
life
excellent
product
good
size
although
quite
heavy
charges
phone
times
+
is
used
to
power
heated
belt
for
back
pain
great
to
be
able
to
use
while
on
the
move
many
thanks
very
good
so
far
so
good
powerful
battery
bank
good
solid
weight
wouldn
want
to
carry
it
around
in
my
pocket
all
the
time
but
handy
to
keep
your
phone
and
gadgets
charged
up
very
good
quality,
very
happy
with
purchase
good
product
fast
delivery
works
well,
can
recharge
an
iphone
at
least
three
times
but
as
result
it
is
bigger
and
heavier
than
the
iphone
itself
so
you
will
need
another
spare
pocket
for
it
just
what's
needed
when
you
cant
get
to
the
mains
paw
looks
good
to
never
travel
without
it
and
far
more
power
than
to
my
previous
little
pack
great
product
obviously
on
the
larger
side
however
fits
in
bags
great
and
has
great
battery
life
the
paw
was
nice
edition
sufficient
capacity
for
couple
of
charges
little
bit
bulky
though
great
item
is
little
heavy
but
expected
that
love
my
little
item
this
is
the
best
power
bank
have
ever
purchased
the

amazing
great

for

up
buying
couple
more

dell'acquisto

prodotto
scadente,
si
scarica
dopo
una
ricarica
ed
pensantissimo
voluminoso
sconsiglio
ho
dato
stelle
solo
perché
è
un
po
troppo
pesante
avrei
preferito
qualcosa
di
più
maneggevole
da
tenere
in
borsama
è
troppo
grande
praticamente
come

per
il

perfecta
super
looks
great
and
comes
with
handy
light
which
have
used
lot
however,
it's
big
and
heavy
bankand
the
thing
that
has
really
upset
me
is
the
lies
about
it's
capacity
when
you
get
the
device
it
has
two
ratings
onthe
back
it
says:
cell
capacity
0,0
mah
underneath
that
it
says:
output
capacity
0,0
mahwhen
read
this
was
very
suspect
as
have
other
power
banks
and
none
have
dual
ratings
like
thisso
did
some
testing
and
my
fears
were
confirmed
from
completely
flat,
with
0ah
charger,
it
took
just
under
0hours
to
charge
if
it
was
0,0
mah
bank
it
would
take
0+hours
in
addition,
my
0,0mah
belkin
charged
my
phone
more
times
than
the
iniuin
summary,
it's
nice
looking
product
and
overall
good
value
but
expect
to
get
0,0mah
since
writing
this
review
iniu
have
been
very
helpful
and
willing
to
refund
or
replace
the
item
so
excellent
customer
service
love
this
