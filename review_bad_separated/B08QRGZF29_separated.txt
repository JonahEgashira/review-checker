video.
the
unboxing
experience
was
very
pleasant.
the
branding
is
very
good,
everything
is
wrapped
individually.
in
the
box
is
the
power
bank,
mesh
bag,
micro
usb
cable,
the
instruction
booklet
and
nice
surprise;
small
bendy
usb
reading
lamp.
as
you
can
see
from
the
pictures,
the
iniu
branding
is
quite
strong
and
everything
comes
across
as
good
quality.the
power
bank
itself
is
quite
weighty
it
has
lot
of
battery
in
it!
and
feels
very
solid,
and
has
smooth,
matt
soft-touch
exterior.
it
feels
wonderful,
the
build
quality
is
very
good.the
paw
print
feature
is
very
cute
but
also
functional.
when
charging
device,
it
shows
the
current
state
of
charge
of
the
power
bank
by
flashing
the
appropriate
toe
.
when
the
power
bank
itself
is
being
charged,
you
get
cute
animation
as
it
charges
see
video.
very
useful,
and
also
cute.the
small
led
torch
on
the
end
is
activated
by
double-clicking
the
small
power
button
on
the
side.
it
bright
enough
to,
for
example,
see
where
you
re
going
in
the
dark,
but
not
to
read
with.
the
separate
plug-in
reading
lamp
is
much
brighter
and
will
come
in
handy
when
camping.the
power
bank
charges
with
either
micro
usb
or
usb-c
cable,
so
for
android
users,
there
is
no
need
to
use
different
cable
to
the
one
you
already
use
to
charge
your
phone.
charging
speed
when
charging
device
seems
very
good.
it
charges
my
iphone
plus
and
ipad
as
quickly
if
not
quicker
than
my
apple
mains
charger
does.
it
basically
works
exactly
as
it
should,
no
fuss.in
summary
then,
this
is
well-
made,
good
value,
premium-feel
power
bank
that
works
exactly
as
it
should,
and
with
bit
of
flair.
really
like
it.
an
excellent
product,
very
nice.
was
in
need
of
power
bank
that
could
handle
couple
of
days
of
use
without
needing
to
be
recharged
that
would
keep
me
topped
up
as
travelled.the
iniu
seemed
good
choice,
similar
pricing
that
of
anker
i've
used
before.
the
unit
itself
arrived
in
small
box,
designed
for
the
item,
with
usb
charger
cable
and
free
usb
plug
in
reading
light
which
was
nice
touch.at
20,000
mah,
this
should
charge
3000mah
typical
smartphone
battery
times
before
it
needs
to
be
recharged
itself.the
unit
comes
with
small
built
in
white
flash
light
as
well
which
can
be
useful
on
occasions.
the
blue
light
on
the
front
represents
how
much
charge
it
has.
its
shaped
like
paw
which
could
be
nice
specifically
for
pet
owners.
to
me
it
was
nice
touch
but
not
essential.
this
is
more
down
to
personal
preference.the
material
case
with
drawstring
is
handy
to
keep
it
protected
from
accidental
damage.
also
like
the
inclusion
of
usb-c
charging.
this
is
something
i've
found
more
and
more
common,
in
cars,
phones
and
finally
battery
packs.
if
you
already
have
usb
or
micro
usb,
you
can
charge
this
with
your
choice
of
connection.overall
the
battery
pack
has
performed
well
and
feels
solidly
built.
would
be
happy
to
recommend
this
model
to
friends.
very
good
quality
product,
the
light
isn't
the
absolute
best
but
guess
it's
more
of
backup
thing
than
main
thing
to
use.
the
foot
print
makes
this
look
amazing
as
it
lights
up
in
blue.
the
casing
is
like
dry
matt
finish
which
feels
grippy
which
is
good.
the
powerbank
holds
lot
of
power
and
charges
well.
it
came
with
nice
carry
case
which
is
nice
to
have
and
stops
it
getting
scratched
on
travels
not
that
this
would
affect
use
in
any
way
at
all
now
this
company
that
makes
these
batterries
take
service
to
new
limit
wow
the
first
one
arrived
faulty
and
not
working
and
on
contacting
them
they
did
not
argue
or
give
me
hard
time
at
all.
the
new
one
arrived
in
the
post
and
to
boot
was
given
it
for
free
for
the
inconvenience
created.
need
say
more.the
product
arrived
well
boxed
and
wrapped
in
its
own
sealed
bag.
the
accessories
supplied
with
the
lamp
and
bag
for
free,
nice
touch.
have
tested
extensively
over
the
last
week
to
see
how
this
little
beast
performs
and
oh
it
does.
the
paw
print
showing
discharge
rate
and
charge
rate
is
brilliant
and
nice
touch.
the
grip
of
the
unit
is
great,
not
to
big
and
the
vulcanising
on
the
outer
shell
is
great
for
non
slip
grip
and
looks
elegant.
guys
this
company
went
up
and
beyond
to
sort
my
query
out,
best
service
have
had
in
many
years.
hats
off
and
well
done
inui.
this
is
decent
power
bank!
it's
really
small
and
lightweight,
just
about
perfect
size
to
carry
in
pocket.
probably
my
favorite
feature
is
you
have
two
ports
for
charging
the
power
bank
itself,
one
micro-usb
port,
and
one
usb-c
the
newer
flat
one,
which
is
brilliant
because
the
one
cable
you
have
with
you
is
usually
the
wrong
one.
the
bank
feels
really
high
quality
with
smooth
texture
finish
which
makes
it
really
easy
to
hold
without
dropping,
and
it
feels
nice!
love
the
pawprint
in
the
corner
which
lights
up
to
show
how
much
power
you
have
left,
it's
cute
and
has
more
personality
than
blinking
lights!it
has
built
in
flashlight
which
is
useful
although
it
doesn't
look
waterproof
so
be
careful
if
you're
taking
it
camping,
and
comes
with
free
plug-in
usb
desk/reading
light,
which
is
nice
touch
:my
only
issue
so
far
is
i'm
not
sure
about
the
capacity,
it
seems
to
run
down
quicker
than
i'd
expect
from
20000mah
power
pack,
i've
had
similar
ones
that
have
lasted
what
feels
like
twice
as
long
from
full
charge.overall
not
bad
product,
like
the
look
and
feel
especially,
but
i'm
not
sure
about
the
20000mah
rating,
feels
more
like
10000mah
:/
update.further
to
my
earlier
review
where
gave
this
powerbank
stars
due
it
it
only
having
13600mah
output
despite
being
20000mah
unit,
was
contacted
by
iniu
and
given
an
explanation
as
to
why
this
is
so.
it
seems
that
no
matter
what
brand
powerbank
you
buy,
its
output
will
only
be
approx
70%
of
its
capacity
which
was
unaware
of.to
make
amends
for
this,
felt
it
only
fair
to
regrade
this
product
to
stars.
it
came
in
one
day
thanks
to
prime
so
iv
already
put
this
in
to
use
over
the
holiday
period
.first
off
the
bat
notice
the
quality
in
this
product
.
take
lot
of
camping
trips
and
road
trips
so
have
been
looking
for
study
battery
pack
that
will
see
me
though
the
times
that
am
not
connected
to
the
mains
.
the
packaging
was
really
lovely
and
it
had
nice
touch
of
free
soft
cloth
bag
and
free
usb
light!!!
which
will
do
wonders
for
my
camping
adventures
rlly
chuffed
.
the
paw
print
design
is
really
cute
also
.
powerbank
arrived
with
100%
charge
and
ready
to
go.
it
is
lil
heavy
but
that
will
take
the
added
weight
for
the
fact
it
charges
rlly
fast
and
stores
lot
of
battery
.
its
very
good
charger.
feels
top
quality.
it
is
not
fast
charger
but
still
charges
in
reasonable
time.
i'm
using
s10plus
and
used
the
charger
times.first
charge
42%
second
charge
56%
third
charge
52%.the
powerbank
started
at
100%
and
was
still
flashing
on
the
80-100%
mark
and
im
continuing
to
charge
my
phone
untill
the
bank
is
dead.
this
should
give
me
an
idea
of
how
long
can
go
away
from
the
grid.
the
charger
doesn't
turn
off
when
the
phone
is
fully
charged.its
says
you
can
use
charging
cables
to
charge
it
but
the
cables
have
are
too
thick
to
do
this.the
bank
came
with
80%
charge
so
not
too
bad.this
is
my
first
power
bank
have
had
so
got
no
reference
to
compare
it.
normaly
use
battery
case
when
go
away
for
weekends.i
would
recommend
this
product
with
the
little
time
have
had
with
it
for
the
value
as
its
cheap.
also
comes
with
usb
light.
been
on
the
lookout
for
reasonably
priced
good
power
bank
for
while.
when
saw
this
one
decided
to
take
the
plunge
and
am
not
disappointed.

times,
think
may
have
gotten
another
full
charge
out
of
this
power
bank
but
decided
to
recharge
it
without
going
for
charge
no
5.
the
casing
on
the
power
bank
feels
really
nice
to
touch.
soft
but
with
enough
grip
so
it
won
slip
out
of
your
fingers.
handy
little
drawstring
pouch
is
included
in
the
box
too,
the
leads
also
come
complete
with
handy
little
dust
covers
for
the
usb/type
connectors.what
really
like
is
both
dual
input
and
output,
good
idea
but
the
piece
de
resistance
for
me
is
the
brilliant
bendy
superbright
led
usb
light
included
in
the
box,
it
superb,
much
brighter
than
torch
on
your
phone.
if
like
me
you
re
fisherman
who
always
likes
to
get
that
last
cast
in
before
it
goes
dark
and
inevitably
finish
up
your
tackling
down
in
the
dark,
this
usb
light
is
godsend.
bought
this
to
keep
my
samsung
s9
charged
up
whilst
fishing
weekends.
have
used
it
couple
of
times
and
am
impressed
with
the
speed
it
charges
and
also
how
much
charge
it
holds.i
tested
this
with
50%
battery
remaining
-
wall
socket
samsung
charger
was
49
minutes
-
the
power
pack
51
minutes.
it
charges
my
phone
from
dead
in
hours.
this
is
about
1:50
on
my
wall
charger.
so,
not
really
much
in
it
in
terms
of
speed
which
is
good
news.it
charged
my
phone
times
with
bit
left
over.
so
perfect
for
weekend.
comes
with
sperate
light
that
you
can
plug
into
usb
socket....and
also
has
light
on
the
unit
itself
which
again
is
handy
when
travelling.
if
you're
travelling
or
have
battery-hungry
phone,
this
is
the
power
bank
for
you.the
power
bank
is
quite
large,
however
that
is
to
be
expected
with
such
powerful
device.
the
manufacturer
has
clearly
attempted
to
keep
it
as
compact
as
possible.as
far
as
power
banks
go,
if
you're
after
20,000
mah
one,
this
is
the
choice
for
you.

this
product
in
particular
rate
one
of
the
best
power
banks
that
ve
ever
had
20,000
mah
for
the
following
reasons
:firstly
the
battery
percentage
indicator
is
very
aesthetically
pleasing
due
to
the
flashing
video
attached
from
the
paw
which
find
very
sweet.secondly
the
size
of
this
power
bank
was
smaller
than
my
iphone
xr.lastly
the
attention
to
detail
and
quality
they
have
invested
into
this
product
impresses
me
immensely,
from
the
smooth
feeling
of
the
power
bank
to
the
pouch
that
they
give
you,
the
usb
light,
the
usb-c
and
mini
usb
ports,
the
paw
and
the
blue
lighting
all
really
impressed
me.
initially
it
was
purchased
for
my
work
colleague
who
doesn
have
prime,
debates
keeping
it!
in
the
end,
just
kept
the
light
as
ll
find
that
fairly
useful
when
working
on
my
car!the
powerbank
is
really
sleek
and
attractive.
the
glowing
paw
print
is
very
unique
and
piqued
everyone
interest
within
our
officethe
power
bank
has
charged
her
s9
4.5
times
before
needing
another
charge.
it
fits
in
her
handbag
nicely
and
she
reports
it
not
nuisance
to
carry
:all
in
all
very
happy,
and
believe
me
the
light
is
very
bright!
this
is
great
little
charger.
bought
for
me
and
my
kid
to
use
during
pokemon
go
fest
day.
they
kept
the
phones
easily
fully
charged
all
day
without
any
problems
and
at
the
end
of
the
day
still
had
about
half
the
battery
left.
there
is
little
paw
shaped
battery
indicator
consising
of
lights
that
are
ully
lit
when
full
and
go
off
by
one
when
the
battery
is
draining.
have
bought
similar
priced
ones
but
not
as
good
as
these.
great
for
camping
or
being
anywhere
without
power.
purchased
this
for
when
went
camping
in
wales.
it
was
really
handy.
comes
with
light
on
the
unit
amd
spare
bendy
light
you
can
plug
in
via
the
usb
port.
the
paw
print
is
nice
touch,
as
the
toes
show
how
much
charge
is
left.
it
is
quite
heavy
but
dont
have
any
others
so
cant
say
if
thats
normal
or
not.
it
also
comes
with
little
bag
to
store
it
in.
over
all
am
very
haply
with
it
great
back
up
for
peace
of
mind.
we
get
power
cuts
fairly
often,
as
live
in
rural
area
with
overhead
cables.
also
handy
in
hospital
if
find
myself
taken
in
unexpectedly,
without
my
charger.
very
heavy
compared
to
the
10000mah
one
got
for
friend.
if
you
don't
want
to
add
lot
of
weight
to
your
handbag,
maybe
get
the
lighter
one
to
take
out
&
about
which
is
what
plan
to
do.
needed
power
bank
because
have
many
devices
to
charge,
e.g
bluetooth
earphones,
bluetooth
speaker,
cigarette,
two
phones..
sometimes
it's
hard
to
find
that
many
plugs
to
charge
everything
at
once.
so
chose
this
power
bank
due
to
very
positive
feedback's
and
wasn't
disappointed
at
all.
it
came
neatly
packed,
with
all
needed
bits.
the
power
bank
is
heavy
itself
which
is
showing
perfect
quality
of
it.
it
has
funny
pawn
which
indicates
how
much
battery
is
left,
also
it
has
flashlight.
in
the
package
there
was
also
included
gift
which
was
reading
light,
very
bright
by
the
way,
and
very
good
for
me
as
like
reading
books.
also
there
was
very
lovely
and
soft
case
for
your
power
bank,
very
comfy
and
good
quality
as
well.
the
charger
is
included
of
course.
there
is
also
an
instruction
sheet,
but
not
very
necessary
as
this
device
is
too
easy
to
use,
you
don't
even
need
to
turn
it
on,
you
just
plug
something
you
need
to
charge
and
it's
on
automatically!
how
cool
is
that?
so
highly
recommend
this
product
for
those
who
needs
some
extra
energy!
received
this
product
just
as
was
about
to
go
away
for
the
weekend.
therefore
was
not
able
to
charge
to
full
capacity
before
left.however
on
opening
the
package,
found
the
unit
itself,
pouch
to
keep
it
in,
micro
usb
and
usb
charging
cable.
as
an
unexpected
surprise
there
is
also
usb
lamp
included
in
the
package,
wow
wasn't
expecting
that.the
unit
itself
appears
be
very
well
made
and
did
not
suffer
after
dropped
it
whilst
in
the
pouch.the
good
point
is
that
whilst
was
away
from
the
single
charge
which
had
not
been
topped
up
was
able
to
charge
the
following
devices
completely.iphone
8+
4000mahhuawei
mate
20
5000mahsmok
vape
3000mahsmok
predator
vape
3500mahi
also
had
the
opportunity
to
use
the
free
torch,
which
is
super-bright
and
very
useful.the
ability
to
charge
devices
at
once
is
bonus.on
my
return
home
the
unit
still
had
section
left
on
the
charge.bad
points
-
really
none.would
recommend
to
other
people,
at
the
price
and
the
capacity,
would
heartily
recommend
to
everyone.
new
brand
on
the
scene
just
started
using
their
power
bank
because
it
was
reasonably
priced.
so
far
i've
used
this
to
charge
my
huawei
and
iphone,
it
seems
to
charge
both
without
an
issue.
the
power
bank
has
rubber
coating
feel
to
it
and
doesn't
slip
out
of
the
hands
as
easy.
i've
previously
had
anker
ones
which
were
shiny
but
slips
easily
when
carrying
around.the
light
that
it
comes
with,
is
more
useful
when
trying
to
read
in
low
lit
area.
absolutely
love
this!
it
can
charge
my
phone
about
four
times
plus.it
does
take
long
time
to
charge
once
it
down
and
do
try
to
de
charge
it
so
it
can
have
good
charge
.
if
honest
was
looking
for
another
power
bank
and
then
saw
this.
and
because
of
the
paw
print
it
swung
it
for
me
but
not
disappointed.
it
amazing.
decided
to
go
for
this
powerbank
due
to
its
price,
capacity
and
extra
features.
it
looks
great
and
is
quite
compact
for
20,000
mah
portable
charger.
think
it
is
smaller
than
average
as
my
brother
has
one
with
the
same
output
but
it
is
bit
longer
that
this
one.
the
light
up
paws
is
great
to
track
what
percentage
the
bank
is
on,
which
is
feature
lot
of
power
banks
do
not
have.
charging
is
great
and
charges
just
as
fast
as
from
plug
socket.
the
added
usb
light
was
reason
why
bought
this
product,
it
is
great
little
addition.
have
used
it
for
reading
at
night
in
pitch
black
room
and
it
does
the
job
perfectly.
battery
pack
is
great
value...lasts
for
hours.
good
design
with

paw
pad
disappears
when

is
being
used.
doesn't
take
long
to
charge.even
get

pack
great!
got
protective
pouch
with
it
too.
perfect
for
any
holiday
or
days

love
it!only
vice
is
it
does
feel
bit
heavy
but
not
problem.
happy
customer.

for
weekend
away
where

no

to
an
electrical
outlet.
this

was
perfect
for
the
job
and
kept
one

and
two
ipads

love
the
paw
print
indicator
showing
how

and

for

which
is
really

.would
definitely
recommend
this
product
to
everyone
what
fantastic
powerbank

nice

love
the

they
even
included

-
and

recommend
this
highly
enough.
this
is
unbelievably
powerful,

it
primarily
for
my
portable
reloop
spin
turntable,
used
on
daily
basis
it
powers
it
for
easily
uptown
month
without
recharging,
sometimes
if
wall
charger
is
not
to
hand
i'll
charge
my
phone
and
tablet
at
the
same
time,
which
this
power
bank
manages
with
ease.i
highly
recommend
this
as
it's
cheaper
and
lot
more
powerful
than
lot
of
power
banks
currently
on
the
market
and
is
ideal
for
travelling
due
to
it's
pretty
slim
size.

this
will
be
great
once
festival
season
starts
in
the
summer.i
also
like
the
paw
that
lights
up
when
fully
charged
and
decreased
lights
when
power
starts
to
drop.
this
is
chunky
power
pack

some
time
to
charge

up
but
feel
confident
we
will
get
several
phones

from
this.
bought
this
to
keep
in
my
handbag,
it
fully
charges
my
phone
about
2+half
times,
it's
quite
heavy
though
and
little
flash
light
comes
with
it
which
haven't
had
the
use
of
yet.it's
great
to
keep
for
back-up
for
your
phone.
excellent
mobile
power
supply
for
my
raspberry
pi
computer
.
not
the
lightest
so
possibly
not
ideal
for
phone
top
up
but
that's
reasonable
sacrifice
for
the
increased
capacity.
am
pleased
with
this
purchase
as
it
has
held
charge
well,
recharges
fast
enough
and
recharges
my

which
could
change
in

but
as
of
know

it
also
come
with

you

and
this

is
just

bit
on
the
heavy

it
has
the

so
it's
expected.
had
about
three
full
charges
off
this
bad
boy
and
still
has
more
to
give.rapid
charge
as
well.faster
than
plugging
it
in.prefect
for
weekend
camping.i
just
have
it
in
the
car
and
use
it
most
days
as
back
up.
very
good
value
but
not
the
lightest
for
traveling.
iniu
has
lighter
but
lower
battery
power
model
which
is
more
travel
friendly
for
hand
baggage.
included
cover
and
reading
light
are
very
good
and
quality
seems
great
so
far.
most
chargers
buy,
last
over
day,
would
charge
on
the
evening
of
the
second
day.
this
charger
does
not
even
last
one
full
day.
therefore,
is
awful
for
travelling
or
anything
as
would
probably
run
out
within
half
day
if
using
it
frequently,
or
having
more
than
one
device
charging
at
time.
it
was
ok
for
week
then
stopped
charging
,
left
it
in
charge
for
20
hours
and
still
not
fully
charged.
have
sent
back
but
had
my
pay
for
postage
,
which
eventually
got
refund
for
.
wouldn
recommend.
looks
lovely,
feels
solid
not
over
heavy
but
you
will
know
you
have
it
in
your
bag.

last
camping
trip!
recommend
when
this
arrived
the
packaging
was
very
good
and
also
it
was
already
charged
to
full
so
used
this
straight
away
the
item
is
quite
heavy
yet
does
the
job,
if
you
have
samsung
s9
you
would
have
to
get
your
own
cable
,
the
cable
supplied
will
not
fit
samsung
s9
or
huwaei
p30
pro.
excellent
for

is
great
external

and
goes
with
me
on
just
about
every
trip.

is
very
durable
and
fulfils
my
requirements
this
power
bank
really
holds
its
charge
well,
once
charged
up.
i'm
not
certain
exactly
how
long
my
iniu
power
bank
has
run
for,
but
it
has
proven
to
be
really
useful,
swift-charging,
long-running,
mighty
charger.
at
approx
350g,
its
weighty
for
the
handbag/purse
but
not
an
issue
for
shoulder
bag/
backpack.

great
and
packaged
well.
fingers
crossed
it
works
well.
will
find
out
at
christmas

work
very
well.
excellent
device
but
disappointed
had
to
buy
another
connector
for
my
phone.
for
the
price
multi
connector
would
have
been
useful.
very
good
portable
power
bank.
always
use
this
great
device
while
being
in
the
out
transport,
travelling
by
bus
or
being
at
work
without
the
connection
to
power
outlets.
also
comes
with
built
in
flash
light
which
tends
to
be
really
useful
and
handy
at
times.
recommend
it
strongly!
its

too
heavy
but
the

ne
ho
acquistate
due
perché
mi
piaccciono:
il

le

le
funzionalità,
la

inserita
nella

portatile.
la
powerbank

una

molto
soddisfatta
dell'acquisto.

solo
perché

un

avrei
preferito
qualcosa
di
più

looks
great
and
comes
with
handy
light
which
have
used
lot.
however,
it's
big
and
heavy
bankand
the
thing
that
has
really
upset
me
is
the
lies
about
it's
capacity.
when
you
get
the
device
it
has
two
ratings
onthe
back.
it
says:
cell
capacity
20,000
mah.
underneath
that
it
says:
output
capacity
13,600
mah.when
read
this
was
very
suspect
as
have
other
power
banks
and
none
have
dual
ratings
like
this.so
did
some
testing
and
my
fears
were
confirmed.
from
completely
flat,
with
1ah
charger,
it
took
just
under
14hours
to
charge.
if
it
was
20,000
mah
bank
it
would
take
20+hours.
in
addition,
my
15,000mah
belkin
charged
my
phone
more
times
than
the
iniu.in
summary,
it's
nice
looking
product
and
overall
good
value
but
expect
to
get
13,600mah.
since
writing
this
review
iniu
have
been
very
helpful
and
willing
to
refund
or
replace
the
item
-
so
excellent
customer
service.
love
this.
