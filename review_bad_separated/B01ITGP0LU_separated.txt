in

when

for

the

comes
out
from

rather
than
the

have
to

reconnect
it
to
make
it

this
never
happened
with

maybe
the
issue
is
with
the

or
maybe
the
earphones
can't
say
let's

poor
sound
quality
not
worth
wasting
time
on
lost
it
even
before

so
rate
:
have
been
using
them
for
month
now,
and
they
are
grart
the
only
down
side
is
that
they
don't
look
so
good
purchased
these
some
time
ago
while
they
were
on
sale
as
backup
pair
so
i'm
beyond
the
return
window,
unfortunately
typically
use
headsets
like
these
while
go
on

runs,

having
them
be
sweatproof

qy0
finally
started
to
give
out
after
years
of
regular
use,
so
was
happy
to
have
these
as
spare
seti
really
did
like
the
sound
quality,
and
once
figured
out
how
to
place
them
in
my
ear
properly,
had
no
issues
with
them
falling
out
of
my
ears
while
on
long
runs
like
that
the
battery
life
was
good
enough
to
get
me
through
week
or
so
of
running
on
single
charge
never
used
them
for
calls,
so
can't
say
anything
regarding
microphone
quality
had
no
major
issues
regarding
connection/pairing
with
my
phone
android
on
nexus
0p,
but
they
would
occasionally
skip
audio
when
would
turn
my
head
too
far
while
runningthe
problem
had
with
these
is
that
they
just
suddenly
gave
out
on
me
after
weeks
of
use
during
recent
run,
they
just
completely
shut
off
and
wouldn't
turn
back
on
figured
that
maybe
the
battery
had
just
run
out,
but
once
got
home
and
tried
to
charge
them,
they
simply
wouldn't
charge
at
all
left
them
plugged
in
for
bit,
but
once
picked
them
up
realized
that
they
were
hot
to
the
touch,
and
wouldn't
turn
on
afterward
completely
deadi
suspect
that
they
might
have
been
damaged
by
sweat,
despite
claims
on
the
product
page
that
they
are
sweatproof
can't
think
of
better
explanation
for
why
they
would
have
just
suddenly
died
on
my
runi
would
look
elsewhere
if
you're
looking
to
find
headset
that
will
lost
would
be
very
upset
if
had
paid
full
price
for
these,
and
they
died
as
quickly
as
these
did
on
to
another
setwon't

my
older

headphones
got
stepped
on
and
when
went
to
replace
them,
found
they
were
no
longer
made
searched
for
an
equivalent,
but
only
found
more
cheaply
made,
yet
more
expensive
models
with
terrible
soundthen
stumbled
across
pair
of
these
bad
boys
no

natural

crisp,
accurate

without

reasoning
behind
taking
the
time
to
write
this
review
is
so
that
more
people
may
make
the
smart
decision
and
buy
these
headphones
so
that
the
manufacturer
will
continue
to
make
these
that
way
when
the
pair
that
have
eventually
get
lost
or
broken,
can
reliably
find
replacements
do
not
leave
the
house
without
headphones
it
simply
is
not
donefrankly,
am
pretty
disappointed
that
similarly
and
much
higher
priced
competitors
cannot
even
come
close
to
the
sound
quality
of
these
bad

product
is

you
should
too
this
is
my
second
pair
of
these
earbuds
and
love
them
so
much
the
other
pair
lost
have
used
other
brands,
but
these
are
much
easier
to
use
and
the
sound

is

stay
in
your

just
fine
and
have
decent

life
sound

are
good
volume

is
poor
compared
to
the
original
guess
i'm
getting
old
but
the
lowest
setting
seems
quite
loud
compared
to
the
prior
model
which
is
disappointing
if
only
using
for
music,
then
this
is
fine
podcasts
etc
and
it's
as
if
someone
is
shouting
at
me
wouldn't
buy
again

besides
this
cant
complain
if
have
to
buy
the
next
genetation
of
this
headphones
would
do
that
definetely
it's
good
product,
the
best
in
it's
price
range
but
they
weren't
made
to
talk
this
is
my
0rd
pair
of
these
and
they're
the
best
sound
for
the
money
you
can
get
these
quit
working
in
less
than
month
had
to
return
worst
heahphones
have
ever
purchased
seems
to
work
ok,
but
never
wants
to
sync
with
my
iphone
also
have
to
charge
it
every
time
go
to
the
gym
and
dies
frequently
awful,
don
even
buy
great
product
and
good
battery
life
they
really
are
as
good
as
they
say
and
just
as
good
as
some
pairs
that
are
much
more
expensive
if
youlike
headphones
that
are
constantly
not
connecting,
dropping
out,
and
stuttering
then
get
thesethrew
them
away
after
having
them
less
than
month
they
did
good
job,
but
short
lived
they
died
this
week,
so
they
lasted
monthsi
guess
that
should
be
expected
with
the
low
price
not
enough
base
for
my
taste
but
they
are
ok
the
only
think
don't
like
is
it
doesn't
give
vocal
"connected"
or
"disconnected"
comfort
is
great
sound
has
good
clarity
bass

0nd
pair,
work
great
0st
pair
lasted
years
with
tough
wear
this
hard
to
fit
inside
my
ear
that
was
enough
for
me
to
return
the
product
felt
very
uncomfortableother
features
could
be
good
but
didn't
not
check
no
words
to
describe
the
superb
quality
of
this
product
can't
believe
this
sound
at
this
price
that
too
over
bluetooth
very
nice
product
luved
it
it's
great
sound
but
bass
very
lowit
lock
not
good
into
ear
and
it'
wire
is
too
long,so
its
uncomfortable
for
me
and
otherwise
very
nice
was
wondering
how
the
blue
tooth
would
perform
and
was
amazed
by
the
sound
output
recommend
this
product
just
got
this
product
delivered
to
me
yesterday
the
funny
thing
is,
when
had
this
product
in
my
hand,
doubted
whether
the
package
has
any
product
inside
or
it's
just
piece
of
paper
because
it
was
completely
weightlessso
opened
the
package
and
found
cute
little
box
insidethat
cute
little
box
had
another
couple
of
cute
little
boxes
inside
one
had
the
earbuds
and
stuff
the
other
box
had
the
actual
headsetpros:turning
on
the
headset
and
pairing
it
with
my
phone
was
quite
easy
except
for
calls,
tested
it
with
audios/videos
and
all
the
controls
worked
goodthe
sound
quality
is
very
good
and
this
was
my
first
bluetooth
headset
ever
so
was
very
surprised
with
the
sound
quality
and
the
claritythe
manual
got
was
in
english
so
there
was
no
problem
with
thatit's
very
light
weightthe
button
kind
of
thing
that
helps
to
reduce
the
length
the
cable
is
very
goodtested
the
usb
charger
while
charging,
the
led
is
in
red
and
turns
blue
after
complete
chargecons:when
paired
my
phone
with
the
headset,
it
didn't
ask
me
for
any
verification
this
headset
can
be
paired
with
two
devices
if
am
not
wrong
so
am
not
sure
if
my
phone's
setup
is
in
such
way
or
the
headset
does
not
ask
for
pairing
passcodewell,
the
cute
button
that
ties
the
headset
wires
to
reduce
the
length
is
good,
but
it
was
little
bit
difficult
for
me
to
understand
how
to
connect
that
with
the
wire
watched
youtube
video
and
did
it
this
is
my
third
pair
of
qcy
earphones
the
two
previous
ones
qcy0
lasted
bit
more
than
two
years
each
don't
expect
this
set
to
last
more
than
that
but
for
the
price
am
ok
with
thati
had
ordered
another
brand
that
had
amazing
reviews
but
when
finally
tried
them,
was
very
disappointed
with
the
quality
of
the
sound
also,
they
looked
like
they
would
break
easily
made
me
question
the
reviewsi
returned
those
earphones
and
ordered
the
qcy0
have
to
say,
am
not
sound
expert
but
this
earphones
have
great
sound
you
can
actually
hear
each
instrument
being
played
they
do
great
job
at
blocking
outside
noise
another
thing
they
have
going
is
the
speed
at
connecting
with
my
phone
it
takes
second
and
we
are
"
connected"i
only
use
my
set
for
music
playing
am
not
interested
in
using
them
for
phone
callsbattery
life
is
good
just
flew
from
philly
to
la
and
back
and
was
able
to
listen
about
an
hour
of
music
after
take
off
and
then
two
full
movies
from
my
laptop
still
had
battery
for
music
during
landing
never
ran
out
of
power
so
guess
should
average
about
hours
of
continuous
play
see
many
reviews
here
in
amazon
that
seem
kind
of
fake
to
me
when
it
sounds
too
good
to
be
true,
them
probably
it
is
as
it
was
the
case
of
the
earphones
returnedthis
earphones
of
course
are
not
the
best
in
the
world
am
sure
there
are
much
better
ones
out
there
preferred
by
some
sound
snobs
but
am
very
satisfied
with
my
purchase,
and
my
review
is
legit
think
it's
the
0rd
one
i've
bought
these
are
fantastic
get
about
hours
out
of
them,
and
the
sound
is
surprisingly
clear
and
wonderful
can
connect
this
to
two
phones
simultaneously
i'll
listen
to
music
on
my
personal
phone
for
music
and
spotify
and
can
still
answer
calls
to
my
work
phone
by
pressing
the
button
on
the
right
earpiecepairing
devices
is
easy
i've
only
had
to
reset
this
once
when
had
connection
problemsthe
range
on
these
is
great
can
be
in
different
room
from
my
phone
and
still
hear
things
finei've
always
had
trouble
keeping
earphones
in
my
big
ears
not
these
these
are
perfecti
wear
these
on
flights
they're
not
noisecancelling,
but
they
do
fantastic
job
of
blocking
out
outside
noise
even
when
they're
offjust
note:
range
is
limited
by
the
minimum
range
of
either
device
in
link,
so
if
your
phone
bluetooth
range
sucks,
even
the
best
longrange
wifi
speakers
won't
help
you
increase
your
range
one
of
the
buds
broke
soon
after
got
the
didn't
bother
replacing
them
because
can
only
hear
out
of
one
ear
anyway
love
these
headphones
so
much
the
noise
cancelling
is
extremely
helpful
and
the
sound
quality
superb
bought
replacement
pair
once
my
first
pair
finally
broke
guess
easy
to
use
lots
of
options
for
use
and
easy
to
negotiate
it
is
great
sounding
little
bluetooth
headphone
just
enough
bass
to
make
it
worth
the
purchase
and
to
respond
here
awesome
productsound
quality
amazing
