bought
house
sign
in
february
from
ksmart
sign
ltd
via
amazon,
which
initially
was
pleased
with,
it
looked
very
smart
however
the
stand
offs
and
covers
have
now
deteriorated
and
have
become
very
unsightly
contacted
smart
sign
ltd
sending
them
the
attached
photo,
and
to
advised
them
of
my
issue,
and
to
ask
if
they
could
supply
me
with
stainless
steel
stand
offs
and
covers,
or
refunded
me
the
purchase
price
they
informed
me
"the
sign
has
been
outside
in
all
weather
types
for
years,
there
was
no
guarantee
on
this
product"
this
product
is
sold
to
be
used
outside
in
all
weathers
would
expect
house
sign
to
last
longer
than
years
month
before
parts
of
it
begin
to
disintegrate
found
the
customer
care
demonstrated
by
smart
sign
ltd
matches
their
sub
standard
house
signs
and
would
deffinatly
not
recomend
this
particular
product,
or
buying
from
this
particular
company
it's
simple
product
not
much
to
go
wrong,
except
mine
arrived
with
four
groups
of
small
bubbles
under
the
plastic,
and
number
of
scratches
not
massive
problem
in
bright
sunshine,
but
not
good
either,
and
emphasised
under
the
night
lighthave
contacted
the
supplier
to
hear
what
they
sayupdate:supplier
sent
new
plaque
it's
better
but
it's
still
plastic
sticker
printed
and
stuck
on
piece
of
acrylic
plus
it's
on
the
small
side
for
people
to
see
it
on
the
wall
love
my
sign
ve
had
my
garage
converted
into
an
art
studio
and
got
this
for
bit
of
fun
really
cheap
and
even
if
it
doesn
weather
well
in
few
years
it
cheap
enough
to
replace
can
comment
on
installation
as
my
builders
put
it
up
for
me
but
it
looked
pretty
straightforward
ordered
first
and
the
back
plate
had
minor
dents
in,
ordered
second
one
and
that
came
with
minor
dents
in
seller
sent
out
replacement
which
also
had
minor
dents
in
and
this
time
dent
on
corner
like
it
had
been
dropped
appreciate
the
effort
to
remedy
my
issues
but
give
up
now
have
sent
one
back
for
refund
and
put
up
the
best
of
the
damaged
bunch
sent
back
up
don
know
if
it
been
damaged
on
route
in
which
case
packaging
needs
to
be
reviewed
not
sure
jiffy
bag
is
sufficient
or
it
damaged
in
production
it
may
not
be
seen
from
outside
but
you
pay
for
something
you
expect
not
to
be
damaged
and
we
know
it
there
we
live
on
the
corner
of
road
on
new
estate
ave
the
house
on
the
other
street
opposite
us
is
the
next
number
up
from
us,
st,
so
everyone
keeps
thinking
we
are
st,
which
is
actually
at
the
other
end
of
the
road
logically
and
knocking
at
our
door
instead
at
all
hours
it
was
infuriating
so
we
got
sign
now
we
don't
have
people
knocking
problem
solved
the
sign
arrived
less
that
hours
after
ordering,
there
was
very
small
issue
which
was
resolved
without
fuss
or
drama
the
sign
looks
great,
easy
to
fit,
and
looks
like
it
should
have
cost
more
the
speed
of
delivery
for
product
made
to
order
was
excellent
and
was
not
disappointed
with
the
sign
on
arrivaleasy
to
fit
and
looks
greatonly
had
it
couple
of
days
so
cannot
comment
on
wear
and
tear
but
for
the
price
would
highly
recommend
supplier
and
product
during
these
difficult
times
of
covid0
this
company
said
the
sign
would
understandably
be
late,
however
they
were
prompt
getting
it
to
us
plus
we
are
so
happy
with
the
sign,
it
really
makes
the
front
of
the
house
look
great
would
definitely
recommend
this
company
and
would
buy
again
this
is
stylish
went
step
further
and
added
my
road
to
the
number
which
looks
fab
can't
go
wrong,
easy
to
install
also,
like
the
idea
you
can
design
before
submitting
so
you
can
check
font
etc,
arrived
on
time,
and
looks
wonderful
with
my
new
door
arrived
within
days
of
ordering
and
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
the
quality
after
reading
some
of
the
reviews
easy
enough
to
install
and
looks
alot
better
than
expected
definitely
worth
the
money
in
my
opinion
this
had
delivery
time
of
days
which
was
fine
with,
however,
it
arrived
after
only
daysit
was
super
easy
to
install
put
it
up
in
less
than
minutes
looks
great
as
welli
would
highly
recommend
this
product
and
company
from
the
experience
had
with
them
with
this
purchase
not
as
good
quality
as
was
expecting,
it
printed
sticker
attached
to
clear
perspex,
not
printed/etched
directly
to
it
as
expected
can
comment
on
fitting
as
haven
done
this
yet,
not
sure
how
it
going
to
stand
up
to
the
weather
with
the
way
it
been
printed/applied
easy
to
install,
nice
custom
made
sign
been
up
few
months
and
has
survived
some
harsh
weather
so
far
only
took
minute
to
take
off
when
painting
the
wall
and
went
back
on
without
issues
lovely
and
neat
house
sign
very
easy
to
assemble
and
attach
to
wall
using
electric
drill
fittings
supplied
nice
and
clear
print
great
value
and
looks
very
smart
on
the
house
front
the
product
came
with
splashes
of
paint
on
the
perspex
sign
that
cleared
with
credit
card
the
screws
are
too
small
,
tried
to
change
them
but
none
of
the
screws
had
fitted
in
the
spacer
have
managed
to
fix
it
now
but
not
without
few
problems,
delivered
quickly,
easy
to
fit
and
install
looks
good
new
as
have
only
recently
fitted
this
can't
comment
about
how
they
look
after
few
years
usage
in
the
open
air
having
already
had
an
expensive
item
go
awol
on
delivery
and
with
lockdown
the
house
turning
into
logistics
centre
and
uber
eats
regular,
having
this
sign
has
put
an
end
to
any
possible
confusion
husband
put
this
up
in
just
few
minutes,
arrived
we
ll
packaged
acrylic
so
not
sure
how
long
it
will
stand
up
to
the
weather
but
reasonably
priced
and
looks
really
good
having
just
recently
moved,
we
decided
to
get
sign
for
the
house

could
not
be
happier

stylish
and
of
excellent
quality

very
easy
to
install
our
order
was
delivered
within

so
could
not
fault
the

very
happily

business
again
with
this
company

not
recommend
them
highly

have
tested
the
ph
of
two
bottles
my
tap
water
is
and
waiakea
alkaline
water
has
ph
of
am
pretty
pod
and
will
be
requesting
refund
have
been
ripped
off
and
will
not
be
purchasing
this
again
this
doesn
even
account
for
the
fact
that
the
manufacturer
packed
box
of
with
bottles
this
is
scam
do
not
recommend
this
water
is
fake
it
not
the
real
waikea
water
ve
noticed
that
it
has
different
top
meaning
it
was
refilled
and
retopped
can
believe
my
eyes
love
this
water
the
real
waikea
water
has
star
on
the
top,
not
some
numbers
and
recycle
symbol
actually
love
buying
anthony
product
buy
lot
and
this
batch
would
be
real
good
if
we
didn
find
latex
part
of
fingertip
in
this
bag
not
sure
if
should
use
this
still
or
throw
it
out
wanted
to
like
this
water,
really
did
however
felt
exhausted
and
lethargic
after
drinking
it
it
is
almost
easier
to
describe
this
water
as
thick
it
really
did
not
feel
refreshing
and
certainly
was
not
worth
the
price
will
be
going
back
to
icelandic
glacial
this
water
may
be
preferred
by
others,
but
certainly
not
by
me
started
to
get
really
bad
acid
reflux
and
was
trying
to
find
solution
that
didn't
include
taking
pills
all
the
time
was
at
loss,
but
stumbled
upon
an
ad
on
fb
about
this
water
it
specifically
mentioned
acid
reflux
and
heartburn
figured
anything
was
worth
try
the
next
time
started
to
feel
the
acid
reflux
kick
in,
grabbed
bottle
and
took
few
large
sips
within
seconds
waiakea
crushed
the
feeling
and
was
back
to
normal
the
rest
of
the
meal
now
swear
by
this
and
recommend
it
to
anyone
that
has
reflux
or
heartburn
the
pricing
per
bottle
is
very
reasonable,
considering
it
is
bottled
in
hawaii
the
water
tastes
like
water
no
plastic
taste
or
off
taste
because
it
is
more
alkaline
thank
you
waiakea
thought
got
conned
by
zac
efron
and
his
new
netflix
series
that
mineral
water
is
better
did
little
research
to
find
the
best
mineral
water
to
try
and
that
was
available
to
me
in
the
usi
attached
the
graphic
used
for
the
decision
making
it
was
worth
itbuying
by
the
case
makes
this
reasonable
priced
if
you
are
interested
and
have
the
$0ish
to
try
it
out
highly
recommend
still
use
my
brita
lot,
but
this
is
my
go
to
bottle
when
am
really
feeling
dehydratedbottle
is
also
certified
carbon
neutral
wow
previously
dissed
anthony's
for
sending
me
"short"
bag
virtually
the
moment
wrote
the
review,
an
anthony's
customer
service
rep
contacted
me
and
offered
to
send
full
replacement
bag
received
the
replacement
bag
within
three
days
after
thati
am
very
satisfied
with
this
product
and
the
service
of
anthony's
not
big
sugar

using
this
for

bottles

please
respondthanks
my
search
was
for
sucanat
obviously
should've
looked
closer
before
buying
really
not
happy
that
paid
$0
for
pounds
of
white
sugar,
but
amazon
says
it
can't
be
returned
would
give
this
star,
but
it's
probably
just
fine
if
you
want
extra
large,
white
sugar
crystals
used
this
to
feed
my
water
kefir
only
drawback
was
strange
brownish
fiber
in
the
sugar
that
had
to
strain
out
of
every
batch
due
to
this
probably
won't
buy
again,
though
it
wouldn't
matter
so
much
to
me
if
was
simply
baking
with
it,
assume
it
is
just
fibers
from
processing
the
sugar
bought
this
originally
to
feed
my
kefir,
but
i've
started
using
it
in
my
tea
it
has
stronger
flavor
than
the
raw
sugar
buy
in
my
local
stores
not
overpowering
but
richer
i'm
glad
tried
this
one
out
organic
cane
sugar
lbs
by
anthony's
received
promptly
and
as
advertised
it
has
good
flavor,
and
is
not
white,
but
rather
an
off
white
thank
you
for
the
excellent
product
this
sugar
hasn
such
beautiful
color
use
it
for
all
my
baking
needsit
is
difficult
to
find
bulk
cane
sugar
with
such
consistent
quality
make
vegan
/
gluten
free
baked
good
for
living
and
rely
and
this
brand
heavily
and
they
have
cool
puns
this
is
my
favorite
sugar
to
use
in
my
homemade
sugar
body
scrubs
it
has
great
grain
size
that
isn
to
harsh
on
skin
it
is
great
exfoliator
have
also
used
it
in
my
tea
it
has
great
flavor
and
love
that
it
is
natural
and
organic
never
buying
again
was
thinking
hey,
it
fresh
&
new,
the
latest
thing,
must
have
no
there
are
ingredients
listed
that
if
it
water
it
should
only
contain
water
dont
get
me
wrong,
your
local
water
department
adds
fluoride
and
all
that
other
stuff
to
purify
it
but
gotta
tell
you,
the
amount
of
sodium
&
electrolytes
are
only
good
if
you
are
at
the
gu
working
out
like
monster
was
drinking
it
as
everyday
water
gained
pounds
in
three
weeks
is
the
company
will
sneak
up
behind
me
and
deny
this
buts
true
ve
been
sick,
cloudy
and
in
pain
it
has
an
ingredient
in
it
that
enough
to
cause
these
issues
while
drinking
bottles
day
yup,
bottles
filled
with
items
that
am
highly
allergic
to
like
said
the
company
will
deny
it,
but
my
body
is
the
proof
aloha
friends
these
are
now
watering
my
plants
didn't
really
pay
attention
to
the
price
when
bought
this
it's
like
over
$0
for
pack
of
water,
and
it's
only
half
liter
bottles
like
the
water
and
i've
ordered
it
or
times
in
the
past
and
had
no
complaints
for
some
reason,
this
time,
the
water
arrived
thrown
in
plastic
trash
bag
instead
of
in
the
normal
box
don't
like
paying
full
price
for
product
that
isn't
in
its
original
box
not
going
to
send
it
back
but
probably
won't
order
again
from
amazon
this
is
my
first
time
purchasing
cane
sugar
outside
of
imperial
from
my
local
grocery
store
have
been
making
conscious
effort
to
buy
more
organic
and
nogmo
items
for
my
family
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
product
used
it
just
as
have
used
other
granulated
sugar
in
the
past,
with
no
issues
felt
better
using
this,
since
it
is
organic
hope
to
find
this
product
for
cheaper
price
in
the
future,
but
the
current
price
point
isn't
deterrent
from
future
purchases
for
me

summertime
humdrum
non
gmo
s,
organic,
glutenfree
there
never
was
gluten
in
sugarcane,
but
no
matter;
feel
like
saving
the
planet
with
every
drink
didn't
think
there
could
be
different
taste
in
bottled
water
but
this
water
taste
do
fresh
and
clean
love
it
wish
could
find
it
on
the
east
coast
would
recommend
we've
been
on
mission
to
change
over
ingredients
we
use
to
organic,
gmo
free
brands
like
anthony's
help
us
do
this,
and
this
sugar
is
no
exception
we
are
definitely
happy
with
it
in
fact,
this
is
our
second
order
of
this
sugar
wonderful
quality,
tastes
smoothno
bitterness
used
to
drink
coffee
from
varying
types
of
coffee
machines,
until
found
this
wonderful
organic
instant
coffee
not
only
do
love
this
coffee,
but
this
is
favorite
now
of
the
entire
family
always
very
happy
with
each
and
every
purchase
drink
spring
water
all
the
time
because
the
tap
water
in
my
area
tastes
bad
have
tried
many
brands
snd
have
my
favorites,
but
thought
would
give
this
try
didn
care
for
it
because
it
has
what
would
describe
as
metallic
aftertaste
almost
like
tasting
the
volcanic
rock
it
passes
through
love
this
sugar
natural
and
tasty
it's
an
excellent
addition
to
my
morning
coffee
used
to
grab
cane
sugar
from
whole
foods,
publix,
or
target,
but
with
remote
working
and
social
distancing,
this
was
an
easier
buy
when
first
received
it
didn't
know
what
to
think
because
it
was
brown
didn't
know
the
difference
at
the
time
about
white
or
brown
cane
sugar
so
thought
that
accidentally
ordered
brown
sugar
nope
apparently
it's
more
healthy,
natural,
and
organic
this
waycool
the
sugar
granules
are
still
fine
and
dissolve
easily
in
liquids
this
is
the
perfect
sugar
for
my
espressos
and
coffee
and
at
decent
price
point,
ordered
easily
with
amazon
prime
free
shipping
the
package
says
this
is
darker
light
brown
to
golden
yellow
color
as
opposed
to
white
sugar
but
when
open
the
bag
it
white
sugar
looking
is
this
supposed
to
be
looking
like
white
sugar
more
importantly
has
it
become
this
way
from
taking
out
the
nutrition
which
is
what
happens
when
they
bleach
sugar
ve
tried
demerara
and
sucanat
which
are
actually
golden
brownso
checking
to
see
why
this
is
so
white
water
was
great,
although
didnt
seem
different
than
some
local
bottled
brands
the
bottle
though
is
beautiful
and
makes
you
wants
to
drink
more
water
it
also
just
feels
nice
to
have
something
from
that
area
but
dont
want
to
make
my
fedex
guy
carry
that
heavy
box
again
this
was
nothing
like
the
evaporated
cane
juice
branded
as
sucanat
that
am
familiar
with
that
is
much
darker
and
has
distinct
flavor
of
molasses
this
is
very
light
with
mild
taste
more
like
the
so
called
"sugar
in
the
raw"
if
it
were
what
expected
the
price
is
good
but
not
for
what
it
is
would
have
been
better
off
getting
light
brown
sugar
ans
save
the
money
while
clearly
marked
lbs,
it's
so
disappointing
to
note
that
the
actual
sugar
is
not
really
lbs
more
like
pound
checked
the
packaging
if
there
were
holes
or
what,
but
it
was
clean
will
never
buy
this
again
as
it's
rip
off
there
are
lot
more
coconut
sugar
brands
that
are
as
good
but
so
much
cheaper
want
my
money
back
this
is
our
absolute
favorite
bottled
water
and
we
splurge
on
it
every
once
in
while
the
price
is
pretty
average
for
other
places
we've
bought
it
the
bottles
are
great
quality
and
can
be
reused
over
and
over
love
this
sugar
it
tastes
better
than
white
sugar
although
the
grains
are
larger
use
it
in
everything
was
not
happy
with
this
water
at
all
thought
it
would
be
cool
bc
it
was
from
hawaii
and
all
this
extra
cool
stuff,
maybe
from
volcano
and
all
but
this
water
taste
is
not
pure
and
definitely
not
good
and
for
the
price
woo
chile
you
re
better
off
getting
deer
park
at
$0
or
for
$0
at
giant
lol
no
good,
and
expensive
to
boot
have
been
purchasing
this
product
for
years
this
is
the
first
time
received
bag
that
appears
to
have
been
cut
with
something
or
was
contaminated
at
some
point
along
the
manufacturing
and
packaging
line
there
are
white
and
black
specs
all
through
the
product,
had
to
throw
it
away
typically
it
is
always
been
wonderful
product,
extremely
disappointing
this
time
lacks
the
robustness
molasses
flavor
of
other
evaporated
cane
juice
products
however,
some
might
prefer
this
more
neutral
tasting
product
hands
down
my
favorite
water
and
my
family
loves
it
we
usually
get
it
by
the
bottle
at
the
store
so
decided
to
find
it
by
the
case
and
am
not
disappointed
0/0
would
recommend
super
expensive
but
i'd
rather
pay
more
for
good
water
than
have
free
poison
flavor
is
impeccable
i'm
water
snob
and
have
recommended
this
to
dozens
of
people
the
bottle
is
very
attractive
and
cant
drink
enough
of
this
water
actually
enjoy
drinking
this
water
no
bad
after
taste
no
lingering
residue
on
your
pallette
great
water
usually
buy
sugar
in
the
raw,
but
figured
would
branch
out
and
try
something
new
saw
this
and
decided
to
get
it
didn't
see
much
of
difference
actually
think
sugar
in
the
raw
was
bit
sweeter
and
had
better
flavor,
but
really
it
all
does
the
same
thing
since
this
stuff
is
pretty
expensive,
won't
be
repurchasing
this
water
is
great
it
has
very
smooth
taste
even
at
room
temperature
no
mineral
notes
nor
the
typical
plastic
bottle
taste
when
it
hot
would
say
this
is
better
than
fiji
water
bought
this
for
my
sister
as
gift
she
water
snob
she
prefers
distilled
waters
over
spring
so
was
happy
to
hear
it
didn
have
musky
spring
taste
plus
it
from
hawaii
great
gift
idea
love
this
sugar
was
introduced
to
it
couple
of
years
ago
and
i've
been
obsessed
with
it
since
then
great
flavor
all
natural
breaks
down
quickly
and
nicely
in
my
coffee
product
ok
amazon
delivery
exceptional
this
is
the
real
sugar
don't
mind
the
coarse
crystals
at
all
just
relieved
don't
have
to
add
extra
0/0th
cup
of
store
bought
white
sugar
in
every
cake
recipe
to
make
it
sweet
enough
this
water
may
be
bit
priceybut
it
is
delicious
kind
of
water
junkie
and
try
all
sorts
of
different
water
this
one
is
by
far
my
favorite
can
only
imagine
this
water
tastes
like
the
clouds
of
heaven
try
to
look
for
more
alkaline
water
and
decided
to
try
this
brand
upon
receipt
tasted
and
tested
ith
litmus
test
strip
and
it
registered
0,
far
from
as
described
considering
the
cost,
it
is
now
worth
it
for
me
due
to
the
toxic
food
products
we
get
these
days
with
toxic
additives,
and
other
unknown
toxins
added
to
our
food,
it
is
wonderful
to
find
somewhere
to
buy
clean
food
this
for
me
shows
that
the
people
at
this
company
have
ethics
and
are
also
paying
attention
to
the
moral
compass
and
not
causing
harm
to
others
due
to
unethical
food
manufacturing
practices
for
that
say
thank
you
when
money
is
the
focus
for
doing
anything,
we've
lost
decency
this
is
great
buy
for
the
money,
would
highly
recommend
it
is,
however,
little
pricy
buy
in
quantity
for
my
grow
nutrient
organic
fertilizer
mix
it
keeps
the
nutrients
from
feeding
off
each
other
while
soaking
in
an
aerated
water
container
great
stuff
all
organic
quick
delivery
this
is
my
first
experience
with
cane
sugar
it
tastes
like
white
sugar
it
is
so
good
want
to
use
healthy
sugar
rather
than
artificial
sweeteners
also
want
to
get
away
from
refined
white
sugar
am
hooked
on
this
cane
sugar
will
use
this
cane
sugar
from
now
on
for
an
unbleached
experience,
happened
upon
this
bargain
came
on
time,
taste
great
and
little
goes
long
way
stars
because
didn't
like
how
the
product
was
packaged,
it
was
stuffed
in
smaller
padded
envelope
the
bubble
wrap
was
all
popped
decent
flavor,
more
pale
color
than
other
raw
cane
sugars
ve
had,
also
have
to
use
more
than
usual
for
sweeter
flavor
so
not
such
good
value
the
packaging
is
awesome
this
water
is
the
best
water
ever
ve
tried
all
the
waters
that
are
out
there
and
this
is
by
far
the
best
water
ever
will
define
buying
more
you
haven
tried
this
water
yet,
you
need
to
it
awesometacular
love
the
flavor
and
feel
much
better
drinking
this
water
than
generic
brands
from
grocery
stores
have
yet
to
test
the
ph
of
this
water
to
make
sure
it
is
as
stated
on
the
bottle
these
bottles
leaked,
not
all
are
filled
to
the
same
level,
and
the
bottle
caps
do
not
appear
as
the
same
as
other
bottles
of
this
water
have
purchased
before
at
other
locations
very
unhappy
and
will
continue
to
buy
my
fiji
water
normally
buy
tastes
like
plastic
my
favorite
water,
stops
acid
reflux
without
doubt
the
best
water
ve
ever
tasted
compared
to
regular
store
bought,
this
makes
them
seem
as
if
they
came
from
garden
hose
flavor
is
better
than
evian
buying
more
best
water
ever
drank
not
sure
if
it
the
bottle
or
the
actual
water
but
there
is
defiant
difference
in
the
purity
of
taste
defiantly
worth
trying
and
buying
this
product
again
received
this
today
there
was
sugar
leaving
from
the
package
upon
arrival
we
opened
the
shipping
package
and
the
bag
of
sugar
was
open
and
leaking
we
are
unable
to
use
this
sugar
and
are
unable
to
return
due
to
policies
was
expecting
the
water
to
taste
amazing,
and
it
tasted
exactly
like
distilled
water
not
smooth,
and
not
tasty
like
it,
although
sometimes
there
are
black
particles
that
usually
pick
away
but
overall
great
sugar
tastes
exactly
like
tap
waternot
worth
the
money
at
all
great
sugar
but
you
can
get
it
cost
less
in
grocery
store
love
love
love
it
such
natural
taste
know
some
people
might
think
water
is
water
and
they
all
taste
the
same
but
feel
like
every
water
has
its
own
taste
my
husband
and
enjoyed
this
water
brand
highly
recommend
the
price
is
little
too
much
but
promise
it
worth
it
me
encanta
porque
es
una
azúcar
fina
la
utilizo
para
hacer
lip
scrub
el
sabor
la
textura
el
empaque
es
grande
good
value
very
tasty
sugar
and
reasonably
priced
sugar
seems
to
dissolve
well
when
needed
will
definitely
purchase
again
arrived
as
expected
and
it
requires
less
amount
to
sweeten
coffee
compared
to
average
store
bought
brands
tastes
really
clean
but
little
pricey
for
water
will
see
if
it
does
anything
for
my
body
in
the
long
run
was
kind
of
confused
with
the
color
at
first
because
thought
that
it
was
going
to
be
darker
but
then
realized
that
in
the
description
says
light
brown
still
the
color
is
not
white
and
it
tastes
delicious
has
lasted
long
time
love
that
it's
organic
feel
like
this
is
bottled
puddle
water
package
came
on
time
the
sweetness
goes
nicely
with
my
coffee
not
too
much
is
needed
at
least
for
me
lol
taste
like
how
sugar
cane
sugar
should
and
the
best
thing
is
that
it's
organic
believe
that
it
is
worth
the
money
for
being
organic
ve
bought
this
brand
many
times
and
definitely
the
best
raw
cane
sugar
ve
used
to
date
would
definitely
recommend
great
tasting
water
at
good
price
and
the
bottle
is
beautiful
discovered
waiakea
in
hawaii
and
am
happy
to
keep
it
coming
home
through
amazon
the
blue
bottle
makes
it
fun
to
hydrate
and
gets
anyone
new
to
waiakea
talking
about
how
cool
it
is
just
love
ordering
this
product
it
doesn't
take
long
from
the
time
order
it
until
it
arrives
at
my
door
am
very
pleased
will
order
again
as
long
as
money
will
permit
infestation

ants
ants
ants
full
of
ants
what
mess
ants
all
over
the
kitchen
had
to
throw
it
away
waste
of
money
this
water
is
harder
to
find
so
having
case
delivered
is
nice
thought
it
would
have
tasted
different
but
it
didn
don
know
why
it
didn
like
it
i've
been
buying
organic
sugar
for
about
year
this
item
is
exactly
what
wanted
great
value
and
nongmo
too
this
water
is
smooth
and
great
to
drink
no
after
taste
and
just
plain
refreshing
really
love
water
and
think
this
is
my
favorite
very
fresh
tasting
without
leaving
any
after
taste
or
being
too
much
it
easy
to
drinki
could
drink
this
in
one
shot
other
than
poland
springits
soothing
and
will
drink
this
anytime
used
it
to
make
full
body
scrub,
it
left
me
feeling
soft
and
fluffy
four
hours
bath
and
body
works
can
do
that
xx
really
like
this
water
wish
it
wasn
over
$0
for
case
probably
will
only
buy
it
occasionally
really
good
tasting
water
whenever
lose
my
water
discipline
of
0z
day,
buy
myself
some
high
test
water
this
is
better
than
figi
water
ordered
this
in
error
thought
selected
coconut
sugar
sugar
had
lumps
in
it
and
seemed
like
it
was
nearing
its
expiration
decided
to
just
deal
with
it
but
probably
won't
order
again
just
like
regular
white
sugar
but
with
no
bleaching
and
organic
don't
taste
any
difference
whatsoever
love
it
one
of
the
pluses
of
this
water
is
the
taste
and
highly
recommend
this
brand
different
type
of
refreshing
taste
it
so
smooth
wanted
to
try
the
product
because
heard
sick
good
thing
but
before
could
even
try
it
am
displeased
with
how
it
arrived
received
the
package
few
minutes
ago
but
when
opened
the
box
the
sugar
was
everywhere
picked
up
the
box
and
sugar
was
leaking
out
the
corners
falling
all
into
my
carpet
not
happy
ok
so
read
alot
of
good
reviews
on
this
water
&
thought
for
the
price
it
would
just
be
out
of
this
world
but
no
best
best
organic
sugar
ever
reorder
because
it
is
very
good
in
making
kombucha
and
kefir
smooth
without
any
after
taste
excellent
value
great
packaging
i'm
happy
with
this
product
use
it
for
my
water
kefir
and
my
girls
enjoy
when
let
them
have
small
spoonful
as
well
arrive
in
timely
manner
and
the
water
taste
great
first
drank
wainakea
water
when
went
hiking
bought
bottle
to
hydrate
during
my
climb
you
can
tell
the
difference
between
this
type
of
water
and
other
cheaper
brands
you
buy
from
the
store
excellent
flavor
great
taste
it
sugarglad
got
it
the
sugar
was
really
good
for
my
homemade
sugar
scrubs
however
they
do
jip
you
it
is
not
full
lbs,
will
probably
not
buy
again
refreshing
hydration
some
of
the
most
purest
water
have
ever
drank
and
also
the
cause
they
are
engaged
in
is
amazing
supplying
clean
water
to
the
less
fortunate
