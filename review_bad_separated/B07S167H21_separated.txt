very
happy
with
the
sound
and
the
battery
life
have
had
some
people
say
they
couldnt
hear
me
properly
when
outside
talking
to
them,
but
this
isnt
main
usage
for
me
own
pair
of
airpods,
but
wanted
waterproof
headphones
that
could
wear
while
working
out
sweat
lot
when
running
on
the
treadmill,
so
it
was
very
important
for
me
that
these
headphones
were
truly
waterproof
and
they
would
stay
put
in
my
ears
despite
being
very
sweaty
also
have
hard
time
finding
headphones
that
fit
in
my
earsthey
usually
fall
out
however,
these
were
easy
to
put
in
my
ears,
and
the
moment
put
them
in
they
fit
snugly
have
used
these
headphones
for
running
and
riding
my
stationary
bike
inside,
and
they
have
stayed
in
my
ears
in
addition,
the
sound
quality
is
fantastic
tend
to
listen
to
lot
of
edm
and
bassheavy
music
when
work
out,
and
to
be
honest,
think
these
earbuds
have
better
sound
quality
than
my
other
headphones
they
charged
very
quickly,
paired
easily
to
my
phone,
and
the
battery
lasts
long
time
plus,
they
come
with
nice
carrying
case,
charging
cord,
and
extra
ear

for

wasn't
expecting
much
from
$0
bluetooth
headphones
in
this
case,
was
mistaken
wore
them
for
complete
minute
elliptical
workout
while
listening
to
some
hypno
sounds
the
sound
was
fantastic
the
fit
was
almost
perfect
find
that
when
you
wear
earbuds
with
over
the
ear
clips
that
sometimes
they
will
irritate
your
ears
after
while
did
feel
little
of
this
discomfort
but
this
is
also
the
first
time
i've
worn
pair
with
over
ear
clips
in
years
they
provided
true
stereo
with
good
base
and
background
noise
was
not
noticable
when
finished
my
workout,
during
my
cool
down,
put
on
the
doors;
riders
on
the
storm
and
actually
looked
outside
when
the
background
thunder
started
connecting
them
was
easy
and
with
little
getting
used
to,
managing
the
the
small
volume
control
is
easy
have
not
used
them
for
answering
the
phone
but
like
most
earbuds,
sure
that
would
be
easy
too
on
these
you
short
press
the
mfb
to
answer
and
hang
up
am
impressed
have
now
worn
these
ear
buds
for
at
least
hrs
day
since
getting
them
am
still
completely
impressed
that
such
inexpensive
earbuds
can
work
as
good
as
the
heavy
hitters
for
much
less
after
having
pair
of
wireless
headphones
break
after
years
of
use
needed
new
pair
looked
around
and
finally
settled
on
these
wasn't
too
sure
what
to
think
of
the
little
"hooks"
by
the
ear
buds
but
after
using
them
in
the
gym
have
to
say
that
the
"hooks"
are
not
noticeable
as
even
existing
and
the
buds
are
super
comfortable
put
them
in
my
ears
and
don't
have
to
constantly
adjust
them
like
i've
had
to
do
with
other
pairs
i've
owned
also
always
had
an
issue
with
these
designs
when
go
to
the
gym
where
during
workout
they
start
to
adjust
and
pull
on
one
side
and
have
to
keep
readjusting
and
pulling
them
back
behind
my
neck
but
not
these
they
don't
feel
like
they
are
constantly
falling
out
of
your
ears
or
off
the
back
of
your
neckthey
charge
quick,
last
while
and
have
really
great
audio
which
my
last
pair
broke
sooner
so
could
of
had
these
longer
was
in
the
market
for
bluetooth
headphones,
and
this
had
the
lime/black
color
scheme
wanted
at
the
best
price
wasn't
expecting
the
quality
for
the
price
paid
the
audio
is
clear
with
good
bass
the
headphones
are
durable,
as
have
tugged
violently
on
them
when
taking
off
my
0pound
backpack
while
traveling
i've
also
used
them
while
walking
in
rainy
weather
know
people
who
pay
more
than
$0
or
even
$0
for
wireless
headphones
stop
wasting
your
money
and
just
get
these
the
only
thing
have
to
say
is
make
sure
to
charge
them
for
the
full
time
required,
as
battery
depletes
quickly
when
you
don't
like
the
fact
that
they
are
packaged
in
cardboard
box
that
can
be
recycled
there's
nice
mesh
bag
inside
for
storing
extra
parts
long
term
the
headphones
were
easy
to
pair
with
my
phone
and
seem
very
well
made
with
all
parts
secure
did
not
test
water
resistance,
but
see
no
joints
where
water
could
seep
in
if
they
did
get
wet
the
two
ends
are
magnetic
and
stick
together
easily
when
placed
around
the
neck
sound
quality
is
good
and
they
stay
paired
with
my
phone
for
relatively
long
distances
like
from
the
first
story
of
my
house
to
the
second
story
of
my
house
in
addition,
they
stay
paired
to
my
phone
when
turn
them
off
mostly
listen
to
audiobooks
and
podcasts,
so
can't
say
how
they
sound
playing
music
the
buttons
work
well
and
the
ear
pieces
smallest
size
of
the
three
sizes
to
choose
from
stay
in
my
ears
comfortably
the
battery
life
seems
more
than
adequate
can
wear
them
all
day
and
listen
off
&
on
throughout
the
day
without
running
them
down
they
are
among
my
favorite
wireless
earphones
to
date
will
update
this
review
as
time
goes
on,
as
have
only
had
these
for
week
i've
been
using
these
earbuds
for
just
over
days
nowoverall

amazing

average

compared

only
rating
it
out

because
of
the

on
the

that
flashes

am
super
impressed
with
the
battery
life
though
much
better
than
my
previous
headphones
from
another
brand
anker,
that
were
rated
at
hours
and
the
anker
ones
cost
morecons
the
bright
blue
light
flashes
every
seconds
when
listening
to
audio
find
it
quite
annoying
i've
always
used
bluetooth
headphones
like
these
mostly
at
night
to
listen
to
podcasts
or
music
i've
also
used
taotronics
and
anker
from
amazon
the
bright
light
on
these
boltune
headphones
is
super
bright
in
the
middle
of
the
night
and
you
would
have
to
put
some
black
tape
over
it
or
somethingi
contacted
the
amazon
product
support
and
they
said
there
is
no
way
to
turn
off
the
blue
light
while
playingi've
had
other

that
may
flash

wireless
headphones
i've
had
many
pairs
of
earbuds,
some
that
purchased
not
so
long
ago,
that
are
wireless
just
don't
like
the
feel
of
the
shape
that
most
earbuds
are,
so
usually
prefer
full
headphones
however,
am
sure
glad
tried
these
the
shape
is
so
comfortable
that
forget
that
have
them
on
included
photos
of
the
earbuds
on,
the
control
for
power
and
volume,
and
how
they
look
facing
straight
ahead
my
hair
covers
the
cord
so
that
they
are
virtually
undetectable
unless
you're
looking
for
them
the
earbuds
themselves
have
strong
magnet
that
holds
them
together
when
not
in
use,
and
this
has
helped
me
so
far
with
not
getting
them
tangled
up
the
package
also
came
with
extra
ear
pieces
and
carrying
pouch
would
definitely
purchase
these
again
also
feel
that
since
it
has
the
attached
cord,
they're
harder
to
lose
than
airpods
hope
you
find
these
as
comfortable
as
do
when
first
received
these
was
pleasantly
surprised
they
seemed
like
they
were
well
built
they
fit
my
ear
well
and
came
with
additional
ear
piece
sizes
to
fit
any
ear
it
was
very
easy
to
pair
to
my
phone
only
use
these
when
exercising
and
they
did
good
job
staying
in
my
ear
while
cycling
unfortunately
after
using
it
only
time
they
stopped
working
completely
at
first
thought
charged
it
incorrectly
but
after
second
charge
and
immediately
trying
to
use
them
after
the
charge,
nothing
happenedi
didn
expect
these
to
be
like
high
priced
ear
buds
figured
could
get
year
of
use
out
of
them
but
only
uses
within
weeks
super
disappointing
have
sent
request
for
replacement
hopefully
the
next
pair
will
last
longerupdate
received
replacement
worked
great
for
about
uses
then
wouldn
charge
expected
them
to
last
for
maybe
year
but
times
ridiculous
your

initial
reaction
was
wow
these
come
packed
in
little
box
and
the
presentation
as
it's
unpacked
is
very
nice
they
came
with
little
charge
so
the
hook
up
to
my
phone
was
less
than
seconds
put
on
drop
bass
instrumental
song
and
was
blown
away
the
sound
is
as
crisp
and
clear
as
my
car
stereo,
maybe
even
more
so
on
the
highest
volume
setting
there
is
zero
distortion
the
volume
range
depends
on
the
source,
for
me
it
was
an
online
video
website
the
bass
resonated
in
my
ear
put
an
earbud
to
one
ear,
lightly,
as
this
is
intended
to
be
holiday
gift
these
are
far
superior
to
other
earbuds
i've
purchased
at
around
the
same
price
can't
wait
to
give
them
as
gift,
i'm
sure
the
recipient
will
be
pleased
will
be
purchasing
pair
for
myself
definitely
my
new
favourites
and
highly
recommended
stars
really
wanted
to
like
these
head
phones,
but
they
did
not
stay
in
my
ear
right
when
started
running
maybe
it
just
the
way
my
ear
is
believe
it
could
be
the
way
they
are
made
with
the
way
they
stick
out
maybe
you
will
have
better
luck
thanks
first,
let
me
say
what
liked
about
these
headphones
was
really
impressed
by
the
high
quality
feel
of
how
they
were
made,
particularly
since
they
are
inexpensive
the
sound
quality
was
also
very
good,
considering
the
price
so,
for
those
points,
these
are
great
headphonesnow,
for
the
issues
had:first,
bought
these
specifically
for
watching
tv
while
run
on
my
treadmill
at
home
found
that
the
inline
volume
control
was
too
heavy,
which
resulted
in
one
side
falling
out
of
my
ear
while
ran
and
this
was
after
changing
the
silicone
earpieces
to
make
sure
was
getting
the
best
fit
possiblethe
other
major
issue
had
was
with
pairing
was
using
with
an
amazon
fire
tv,
and
have
paired
other
bluetooth
headphones
without
issue
the
pairing
process
took
much
longer
than
usual
and
found
that
after
turning
off
the
headphones,
would
have
to
go
through
the
pairing
process
again
when
turned
them
back
onthese
two
issues
were
both
dealbreakers
for
me,
so
am
returning
them
and
hope
my
feedback
helps
the
company
improve
their
design
in
the
futureupdate:
have
been
contacted
by
different
customer
service
representatives
from
boltune,
all
offering
to
pay
me
the
cost
of
the
headphones
if
delete
my
review
that
just
sad
that
they
don
seem
ok
with
receiving
constructive
criticism
gave
fair
and
honest
review
and
not
going
to
delete
it
other
people
may
want
to
get
headphones
for
running
and
would
be
glad
to
know
that
these
aren
good
pair
for
that
or
if
someone
else
has
fire
tv
they
want
to
use
with
headphones,
they
may
want
to
know
that
there
chance
these
won
workreviews
are
designed
to
tell
the
good
and
the
bad,
and
the
average
speaks
for
the
overall
customer
satisfactionto
boltune:
if
you
spend
more
time
and
resources
on
product
development
than
desperate
customer
service,
you
would
have
better
product
that
would
naturally
avoid
critical
reviewsupdate:
was
just
contacted
again
by
someone
from
boltune's
super
unprofessional
customer
service,
offering
me
gift
card
or
replacement
product
these
people
really
can't
stand
being
given
negative
feedback
listen
to
music
about
hours
day
at
work
and
easily
got
days
out
of
these
the
sound
was
better
than
expectedpassive
noise
cancellation
was
better
than
expected
these
do
not
have
active
noise
cancelling
anc
anc
is
when
device
listens
to
noise
around
you
and
sends
an
opposite
soundwave
out
of
the
speakers
to
cancel
the
ambient
noise
"passive
noise
canceling"
is
nothing
more
than
ear
plugs
or
ear
muffs
these
are
"passive",
and
it
bothers
me
when
people
post
negative
reviews
because
they
don't
know
the
difference
between
active
and
passivei
believe
the
microphone
does
have
anc,
but
it's
to
help
reduce
ambient
noise
when
you
are
on
the
phone,
but
if
it
does,
it
doesn't
worki
normally
do
not
like
things
in
my
ears,
but
these
are
very
comfortable
you
can
twist
them
in
your
ear
to
allow
for
more
passive
noise
cancelling
or
twist
them
the
other
direction
so
you
can
hear
whats
around
you
betterthe
bad:
the
microphone
is
garbage
people
call
using
these
headphones
say
it
sounds
like
i'm
in
cave,
or
they
just
can't
hear
me
at
all
because
small
breeze
sounds
like
tornado
to
themonly
use
is
as
headphones,
do
not
recommend
using
to

on

phonei
would
buy
again,
as
long
as
they
continue
to
perform
for
at

the

the

don't
lose
them
the
quality
of
sound
provides
deeper
bass
tone
which
makes
music
way
more
enjoyable
can
also
use
these
to
drown
out
crowd
sounds
in
busy
areas,
or
my
wife's
snoring
would
absolutely
recommend
these
personally
don't
like
airpods,
as
these
are
more
comfortable
and
the
price
is
affordable
great
gift
oh,
and
they
are
waterproof
actually
took
them
into
the
shower
to
try
them
out,
no
issues
not
that
would
shower
with
headphones,

away
by
the
awesome
customer
service
of

so
happy

continue
to
be
some
of
the
most
comfortable
headphones
ve
ever
worn
the
sound
quality
is
fantastic
and
would
absolutely
recommend
these
to
others
wow,
they
deserve
all
five
starsupdate
bought
these
in
december
about
months
ago
and
today
they
stopped
working
was
so
disappointed
ve
ran
everyday
in
these
and
have
really
loved
them
but
not
sure
what
happened
marathon
runner
and
have
ran
anywhere
between
and
0+
miles
in
these
headphones
each
day
and
they
ve
worked
great
the
sound
quality
was
good
they
were
easy
to
use
they
connected
to

fast
unfortunately,
they
just
did
not
last
for
meoriginal
review:
recently
purchased
garmin
watch
that
can
stream
music
via
bluetooth
so
bought
these
headphones
per
the
recommendation
of
friend
ve
ran
in
them
several
times
and
they
work
great
syncing
them
to
my
watch
was
very
easy
and
straightforward
make
sure
they
re
close
to
one
another
–
within
feet
–
hold
in
the
multifunction
button
middle
triangle
button
until
the
led
light
flashes
red
and
blue,
and
boltune
btbh0
should
pop
up
on
your
device
indicating
that
it
ready
to
sync
the
headphones
come
with
charging
cable
but
be
aware
that
they
do
not
include
the
actual
adaptor
that
plugs
into
an
outlet
just
used
the
same
adaptor
that
use
to
charge
my
phone
and
it
worked
fine
you
could
also
plug
the
usb
charger
into
any
computer
or
laptop
for
charging
too
do
like
to
be
aware
of
my
surroundings
when
running
so
only
wear
one
earbud
when
running
the
ear
bud
has
never
fallen
out
of
my
ear
and
really
happy
with
how
well
it
stays
in
place
just
wrap
the
ear
bud
side
that
not
using
around
the
strap
of
my
sports
bra
to
keep
it
in
place
and
prevent
it
from
bouncing
around
overall,
ve
been
happy
with
these
headphones
and
they
re
working
great
for
listening
to
music
while
run
usually
don't
take
the
time
to
write
reviews
however
am
paid
for
this
review
but
it
doesn't
change
what
am
writingi
am
greatly
impressed
with
the
sound
quality
with
these
headphones
believe
me
am
picky
it
will
be
great
for
audiophiles
and
people
with
great
ear
for
good
sound
while
was
hoping
for
more
bass
then
it
has
but
the
treble
and
clarity
blows
most
my
headphones
away
this
is
super
close
to
my
old
sennheiser
cx
0ii
compare
all
my
headphones
to
it
that
one
is
the
best
sounding
headphones
ever
had
and
the
bass
blows
everything
out
of
the
water
these
beltune
headphones
are
pretty
much
the
same
but
less
bass
those
old
sennheisers
are
corded
so
after
being
cordless
for
many
years
it's
hard
to
want
to
use
cord
again
got
these
beltunes
so
can
have
headphones
to
use
with
my
bicycle
helmet
for
bike
riding
been
wanting
something
new
anyways
i'm
glad
got
these
in
place
of
the
$0
best
sellers
sent
back
that
sounded
like
listening
to
music
with
towel
over
speakers
or
earplugs
in
those
were
the
worst
ones
ever
had
period
even
worse
then
the
free
onesupdate:
somewhere
during
the
first
ten
hours
burn
in
time
the
bass
tightened
up
and
really
notice
it
now
for
the
last
few
weeks
of
use
has
really
good
bass
nowbut
as
for
comfort
my
picky
ears
started
hurting
after
used
the
stocking
cap
over
the
headphones
when
outside
earlier
put
the
small
sized
hook
attachments
on
and
after
few
hrs
it
wasn't
so
bad
but
not
sure
with
the
stocking
cap
or
bicycle
helmet
will
update
if
continue
to
have
issuesi
also
love
the
magnetic
clips
to
clip
them
together
and
easy
to
use
buttons
on
the
cord
took
phone
call
and
my
person
on
the
other
line
heard
me
just
fine
which
isn't
always
the
case
talking
on
bluetooth
so
know
at
least
that
time
it
worked
for
phone
callin
conclusion
these
headphones
will
be
great
for
most
people
if
your
ears
can
tolerate
this
style
hope
this
review
helps
others
looking
for
headphones
have
fun
shopping
for
headphones
and
great
day
update:it's
been
just
over
months

bought
these

they've
already
brokeni
don't
use
them
often
i'm
guessing
i've
ran
them
them
maybe
times
at
the
mosti
really
expected
more

of
these

good
is

sounding"

then
no
one
has
bothered

mei'll
do
at

star
if
they
get
in

with
memore
depending
on
the
solution===============original
post:===============i've
been
using
these
for
over
month
now
and
have
to
say
i'm
actually
impressed
so
farbattery
life
on
these
seems
respectable
i've
yet
to
drain
them
on
accidenti
don't
have
good
timeline,
but
use
them
for
upwards
of
few
hours
at
time
and
have
only
charged
them
maybe
or
times
in
the
last
monthsound
quality
is
very
respectable,
especially
for
the
price
pointthe
ear
hooks
on
these
buds
are
great
thing
if
you're
active
like
to
run
and
have
gone
through
quite
few
earbuds
finding
ones
that
stay
in
these
stay
in
mean
that
alone
makes
them
worth
itcomplaintsthe
mic
suuuuuuuucks
like
badi
wanted
to
use
these
while
gamed
on
my
laptop
and
everyone
told
me
voice
sounded
like
walle
was
trying
to
have
sex
with
speak
and
spell
so
if
you
want
this
for
chatting,
might
suggest
another
headseti
also
don't
like
the
cord
length
this
isn't
huge
thing,
just
one
of
those
tiny
things
that
bugs
you
once
in
whileif
the
cord
was
another
or
inches
long,
it
could
be
tucked
into
your
shirt
as
it
is
now,
it
sticks
out
not
dealbreaker,
but
worth
mentioning
in
case
the
manufacturer
wants
ideas
on
how
to
improve
thisi'm
waiting
to
see
how
long
they
last
if
they
break
within
years
of
buying
them,
the
rating
will
be
an
instant
star
quality
of
construction
is
paramount
to
meif
this
review
is
still
star,
they
haven't
broken
i've
had
these
headphones
for
about
month
and
overall,
like
them
and
am
glad
bought
them
the
sound
quality
is
great
and
even
better,
they
don't
"sound
leak"
where
everywhere
can
hear
what
i'm
listening
to
the
noise
cancellation
is
excellent
have
one
major
personal
complaint
and
one
minor
the
only
major
complaint
have
is
that
the
ear
piece
sticks
out
farther
than
prefer,
as
in
it's
not
as
flat
against
my
ear
since
it's
winter,
like
to
wear
earmuffs
but
can't
wear
them
with
these
because
the
earmuff
digs
in
the
ear
piece
too
much
i've
had
other
headphones
that
don't
stick
out
from
my
ear
that
far,
and
was
able
to
wear
my
earmuffs
only
during
the
winter
time
will
this
be
problem
the
minor
complaint
have
is
that
the
wire
connecting
the
head
phones
is
not
that
flexible
if
it
gets
twisted
too
much,
it
sticks
straight
out
so
have
to
constantly
make
sure
it
lays
flat
these
are
not
offputting
issues
for
purchasing
the
item
the
headphones
are
great;
simple
to
connect
with
my
bluetooth;
and
very
easy
to
use
they
are
very
good
purchase
if
could
give
half
rating,
would
give
these
stars
pros:great
battery
life,
good
fit
with
interchangeable
earbudsbig
con:you
will
hear
every
move
you
make
as
the
wire
rubs
against
your
clothing
making
scratching
sound
overtop
of
the
music
or
movie
soundtracki
would
recommend
looking
elsewhereupdate:so
this
is
more
an
update
of
the
company
boltune
sent
this
product
back
to
amazon
due
to
the
above
issue
the
company
responded
with
very
polite
email
more
companies
on
amazon
should
contact
unenthused
customers
saying
they
had
made
changes
to
the
ipx0
and
sent
new
pair
of
wireless
earbuds
bh0
as
replacements
it's
called
customer
service
for
reasonnow
these
are
very
good
earbuds
the
bass
is
excellent
[at
least
for
me]
and
pairing
was
instant
to
my
oneplus
0t
phone
these
sound
better
than
the
aukey
ear
buds
that
have
paired
to
my
tv
highly
recommend
thanx
to
boltune
for
the
followup
and
assistance
these
headphones
are
good
value
for
the
price
the
weight
of
the
control
make
them
somewhat
unbalanced
on
the
right
side
that
for
me
pulls
the
headphone
out
of
the
ear
when
run,
so
not
really
running
headphone
shared
this
issue
with
boltune
and
they
provided
very
good
customer
service
sending
me
replacement
model
but
if
you
are
looking
for
running
headphone
specifically,
then
would
recommend
looking
at
different
boltune
model
overall
decent
headphone,
not
particularly
for
running,
and
solid
customer
service
was
skeptical
about
these
earbuds
because
of
the
shape
of
the
silicone,
but
these
are
pretty
dope
they
block
out
my
coworkers
pretty
well
when
i'm
in
the
office
if
i've
forgotten
my
actual
headphones
and
they're
comfortable
normally,
earbuds
start
to
hurt
my
ears
after
being
in
too
long,
but
haven't
experienced
that
with
these
yet
the
sound
quality
was
good
for
the
price
was
actually
very
impressed
can
use
them
to
block
out
the
grunting
at
the
gym
and
the
overhead
music
they
are
much
better
than
the
skullcandy
earbuds
was
using
and
don't
cut
out
enjoy
that
the
range
on
them
is
good
so
that
if
my
leggings
don't
have
pockets,
can
put
my
phone
on
the
floor,
go
get
weights,
and
still
be
connected
because
i'm
not
going
fari
recommend
these
for
workout
earbuds
they
seem
to
hold
up
in
my
ears
during
my
circuit
trainings
my
only
issue
with
them
is
that
if
have
one
in,
the
weight
from
the
control
bar
will
cause
it
to
tug,
so
if
i'm
trying
to
talk
to
someone,
it's
best
to
just
have
them
magnetized
together
around
my
neck
instead
of
one
ear
in
and
one
ear
out
or
it
will
slide
purchased
these
for
work
from
home
in
march
as
both
my
spouse
and
have
both
been
working
from
home
i've
been
using
them
for
about
months
my
spouse
bought
pair
of
airpod
pros
$0
and
purchased
the
boltune
bluetooth
headphones
$0
totally
different
price
points
and
featuresif
you
are
looking
for
basic
set
of
bluetooth
headphones
at
an
inexpensive
price
these
are
great
their
battery
life
lasts
me
all
work
day
as
long
as
charge
them
overnight
while
my
spouse's
airpod
pros
better
dies
in
the
middle
of
the
dayi
can
connect
the
boltune
headphones
my
computer
and
my
phone
too
which
is
nice
sound
quality
is
solid,
it's
nothing
exceptional
but
hear
the
folks
am
meeting
with
and
they
hear
me
with
good
clarity
the
boltune
headphones
do
not
have
sound
cancellingi
also
appreciate
having
wire
connecting
the
two
ear
buds
and
the
ear
buds
magnetically
connect
around
my
neck
when
i'm
not
actively
using
them
don't
lose
them
because
of
this
feature
although
this
may
be
turn
off
for
some
folksi
have
noticed
that
the
bluetooth
range
of
these
headphones
is
less
than
the
airpods,
can
lose
connection
beyond
0'
my
spouse's
airpod
pros
stay
connected
much
furthermy
spouse
can
see
their
battery
life
%
of
their
airpods
headphones
cannot
see
the
charge
level
of
the
boltune
headphones
but
as
long
as
charge
the
boltune
headphones
overnight
they
work
all
day
the
only
exception,
has
been
if
am
working
an
extended
work
day
over
hrs
i've
had
to
do
boost
charge
on
those
days
i've
gotten
hours
of
use
on
change
though
which
is
amazing
the
airpod
pros
only
have
about
hours
of
use
on
changeoverall,
for
$0
pair
of
bluetooth
headphones
think
the
bultunes
are
an
amazing
purchase
they
are
easy
to
use
and
solid
performance
for
full
workday
i'm
happy
with
my
headphones
and
would
purchase
them
again
in
heartbeat
the
main
reason
got
this
style
is
it
doesn't
interfere
with
my
glasses
anything
hanging
on
my
ear
presses
my
glasses
frame
and
is
uncomfortable
since
this
fits
in
the
ear,
it
doesn't
cause
that
problem
at
alli've
tried
three
brands
of
these
aroundtheneck
headsets
so
far,
and
like
this
one
the
best
only
have
to
charge
it
once
week
turn
it
off
when
not
using
it
the
audio
sounds
great
the
controls
are
good,
with
solid
"click"
when
depressed
the
magnets
are
soso
strong,
but
just
like
the
others
i've
tried:
they
will
hold
it
in
place
during
the
day,
but
if
i/m
moving
around
vigorously
they
can
unsnap
no
worse
then
the
competition
they
are
just
the
right
length
if
you
take
the
time
to
select
the
small/medium/large
ring
that
fits
your
ear
and
cap
that
goes
inside
my
ears
are
apparently
different
sizes,
you
can
get
snug
fit
that
won't
fall
out
during
moderate
exercise
but
aren't
so
tight
they
make
your
ear
hurt
after
short
time
and
the
microphone
is
fine
except
prone
to
wind
noise,
but
all
similar
models
have
the
same
issue
with
this
live
in
windy
place,
so
it's
annoying
cup
the
mic
with
my
hand
if
it
gets
too
breezy
during
callbut
the
reasons
like
this
one
better
than
the
others:
the
way
the
"ring"
part
fits
on,
it
has
small
peg
that
keeps
it
from
rotating
out
of
place
i've
found
this
very
annoying
with
other
brands,
as
they
move
every
time
take
them
off
so
have
to
line
them
up
when
put
them
back
on
this
is
really
nice
they
seem
extra
good
at
blocking
out
background
noise
you
can
still
hear,
but
much
quieter
also
have
not
have
the
"cone"
part
fall
off
once
when
taking
them
off
or
having
my
shirt
pull
them
off,
etc,
which
then
is
easy
to
lose
and
has
been
problem
with
some
of
my
earlier
sets
of
other
brands
always
keep
the
extra
size
parts,
needed
mine
and
they
look
wellmadeso
if
you
wear
glasses,
these
are
the
best
i've
found
just
leave
them
clipped
around
my
neck
all
day
and
if
do
take
them
off
and
misplace
them
it's
happened,
they
are
easy
to
replace
and
i'm
not
out
hundreds
for
aitpods
had
wanted
to
give
this
device
five
stars
before
it
arrived
but
sadly,
could
not
get
the
headphones
to
make
consistent
pair
it
took
long
time
to
pair,
and
when
it
did
it
was
fine
however,
when
paused
my
audiobook,
the
headphones
unpaired
and
could
not
get
them
paired
again
the
next
day,
tried
to
pair
again
with
my
audiobook
device
and
my
tablet
tablet
and
pod,
on
and
off,
reset
and
then
the
boltunes
on
and
off
if
someone
were
purchasing
these
for
the
first
time
and
had
never
used
bluetooth
earbuds,
they
might
think
that
this
is
normal
but
one
bluetooth
earbuds
should
make
an
almost
immediate
pair
and
then
stay
on
for
the
day
never
had
chance
to
see
how
long
the
boltumes
would
operate
since
they
unpaired
when
paused
my
audiobook
and
would
not
connect
againi
do
appreciate
the
magnets
and
would
suggest
that
anyone
purchasing
this
style
of
headphones
get
ones
with
magnets
they
are
an
excellent
feature
and
do
appreciate
their
convenience
only
got
these
earphones
yesterday
so
can't
speak
on
the
longevity
of
the
product
but,
when
got
them,
charged
them
up
they
charged
pretty
fast
linked
them
to
my
laptop
to
listen
to
videos
the
bluetooth
linked
easily
without
me
having
to
fight
with
the
earphones
or
laptop
the
sound
quality
is
pretty
good
at
first,
they
were
comfortable
but
then
my
ears
got
little
sore
but,
think
it
was
only
because
it
came
with
the
medium
size
buds
already
attached
so,
replaced
them
with
the
small
ones
and
they
felt
more
comfortable
got
the
grey
ones
and
they
seem
true
to
color
did
not
jog
or
walk
around
with
them
on
but,
they
felt
pretty
snug
in
my
ear
so,
even
if
were
to
move
around
with
them
on,
don't
feel
like
they
would
fall
out
also,
like
how
the
backs
of
the
ear
buts
stick
together
with
magnet
furthermore,
bought
these
because
the
look
lot
less
bulky
that
those
huge
wireless
earphones,
and
are
connected
so
it's
less
likely
i'd
lose
them
like
the
apple
airpods
or
something
similar
also
like
the
things
they
came
with
it
came
with
little
storage
pouch,
an
instruction
booklet,
charging
cable,
and
various
sizes
of
ear
buds
for
your
convenience
also,
the
little
zip
bag
that
the
charging
cable
came
with,
kept
it
to
hold
all
the
little
extra
earbuds
so
they
don't
get
lost
it
came
in
pretty
handy
overall,
it
seems
like
pretty
good
product
and
i'm
happy
with
them
if
you
are
in
the
market
for
wireless
headphones,
definitely
recommend
these
months
after
writing
this
review
the
company
rep
finally
reached
out
and
offered
to
send
gift
card
or
replace
the
item
changed
my
review
from
to
based
on
the
fact
that
the
company
made
it
right
however,
my
review
of
the
product
itself
stands
there
are
way
too
many
false
reviews
for
products
on
amazon
so
take
solid
position
on
my
reviews
do
understand
and
support
company
that
will
fix
an
issuebut
months
later
is
an
issue
also
understand
that
there
are
lemons
with
any
product
lineafter
month
of
use,
these
died
it
will
not
turn
on
but
the
red
light
indicates
that
they
are
charged
no
response
from
the
company
also

only

frankensteinso
really
have
no
dislikes
about
this
product
whatsoeverthank
you
for
ending
my
search
ve
been
using
these
earbuds
for
around
weeks,
here's
what
think
so
far:sound
quality:
0/0
don
know
ton
about
audio
quality,
but
the
sound
seems
good
to
me
the
volume
is
goodwhen
listening
to
music
on
spotify
or
amazon
prime,
the
lowest
volume
is
just
right
when
there
is
no
music/faint
music,
do
hear
white
noise
at
times
so
far,
don
mind
itit
faint,
and
don
hear
it
when
music
is
playingfit:
0/0
these
feel
pretty
good
at
first,
but
they
get
little
bit
uncomfortable
when
have
them
in
for
several
hours
straight
they
seem
to
withstand
sweat
and
stay
in
place
when
walking
or
running,
and
they
do
cancel
out
some
outside
noise
when
music
is
playing
overall,
these
don
fit
badly,
but
ve
worn
more
comfortable
earbuds
eg
my
old,
cheap
pair
of
skullcandy
earbudsbattery:
0/0
the
battery
life
on
these
has
been
excellent
so
farmine
do
have
the
0hour
battery
life
advertised
got
around
hours
out
of
them,
think
the
missing
hour
is
because
forget
to
turn
them
off
once
or
twice,
and
they
take
around
an
hour
and
half
to
charge
fully
one
charge
for
me
can
easily
last
few
weeks
there
are
great
pair
of
headphones
that
deliver
crisp
sound
quality
and
the
right
amount
of
bass
had
been
looking
for
replacement
for
pair
that
had
lost
and
and
had
been
very
happy
with
the
first
pair
that
was
shipped
seemed
to
have
bit
too
much
treble,
but
the
vendor
sent
me
new
pair
after
assuring
me
that
they
were
now
working
with
more
reliable
manufacturer
the
replacement
pair
was
significant
improvement,
and
could
finally
understand
why
the
product
had
gotten
so
many
good
reviews
the
sound
is
very
balanced,
and
easily
passed
the
bass
test
youtube
video
that
checked
them
with
there
is
no
noise
when
on
standby
or
during
quiet
sections
of
podcasts
or
songs
with
lot
of
dynamic
range,
which
is
great
because
one
advantage
of
having
earbuds
with
snug
fit
is
that
you
can
turn
the
volume
down
to
protect
your
ears
overall
great
product
and
exceptional
value
firstly,
am
no
runner,
but
do
like
to
run
and
row
at
the
gym
from
time
to
time
ive
never
had
luck
with
headphones
staying
in
my
ears
have
smaller
ears
they
hurt,
they
fall
out,
or
lose
connection
read
the
reviews
and
figured
would
give
these
try
loved
the
price,
the
bluetooth
component,
and
the
magnetic
feature
wasnt
crazy
about
the
wings,
because
initially
thought
they
would
hurt
or
not
do
much
for
me
these
come
with
may
different
sized
earpieces
and
wings
right
out
of
the
box,
tried
on
the
smallest
pair
jumped
around
in
them
and
they
fell
out
then
decided
to
keep
the
small
ear,
but
medium
wing
they
are
perfect
the
stay
in
sound
quality
is
alright;
am
no
music
connoisseur
they
do
the
job;
no
rattling
or
buffering
of
sound
sound
cancellation
is
alright,
but
that
depends
on
fit
of
course
battery
life
is
great
and
so
is
charging
the
only
imporovement
could
make
is
that
the
distance
is
short
you
need
to
have
your
phone
within
ft
of
you
if
you
have
it
on
you
at
all
times,
perfect
if
not,
you'll
get
"connection
lost"
alert
over
the
headphones
great
buy
would
buy
again
thank
goodness
choose
these
over
bose
which
were
also
in

update
read
the
whole
thing
to
get
complete
picture
of
my
experiencethe
seller
has
been
relentless
in
trying
to
get
me
to
upgrade
this
review
i've
been
offered
full
refund,
gift
cards
of
various
amounts,
and
replacement
earphones,
some
of
presumed
better
quality
finally,
agreed
to
update
the
review
in
exchange
for
another
pair,
but
warned
that
would
give
an
account
of
the
service
received
so,
here
it
isi
have
ordered
three
pairs
of
these
had
the
last
months,
then
it
was
gone
like
heart
attack
i'm
not
abusive
of
my
gear,
but
the
others
only
lasted
about
as
long
on
average
fine
if
you
want
throwaway
pair,
but
if
you
want
something
that
lasts
longer,
these
may
not
be
the
ones
you're
looking
for
the
quality
of
the
sound
isn't
bad,
but
i'm
no
audiophile,
just
an
older
guy
whose
hearing
and
eyesight
aren't
what
they
used
to
beanyway,
my
onestar
review
kicked
off
round
of
emails
asking
me
to
upgrade
in
return
for
refund/replacement
ignored
or
responded
with
request
for
refund
and
no
change,
but
0star
review
is
just
short
of
apocalyptic,
apparentlyi
would
say
that
the
company
is
really
addicted
to
or
0star
reviews,
and
that
seems
to
translate
into
giving
the
customer
something,
anything
to
get
one
if
you
don't
mind
dealing
with
product
that
quits
in
order
to
get
another
one,
guess
you
could
give
the
seller
great
marks
for
serving
the
customerhaving
said
all
that,
and
given
the
fact
that
i'm
still
even
now
that
have
another
working
pair,
if
this
current
pair
fails,
will
be
back,
and
it
won't
be
to
gild
this
review
another
update
have
been
given
free
replacement
really
appreciate
the
support
they
have
given
me,
and
like
these
wireless
ear
buds
lotupdate
after
months:the
device
no
longer
charges
have
very
carefully
used
the
micro
usb
charger
and
it
works
enough
to
turn
the
light
blue,
but
does
not
actually
charge
the
battery
have
repeated
the
charging
process
with
both
the
charger
that
came
with
the
headphones
and
again
with
another
micro
usb
charger
that
had;
neither
was
able
to
charge
these
headphones
this
means
that
the
bluetooth
headphones
are
unusable
interestingly,
it
was
bit
of
gradual
death;
at
first
they
kept
charge
for
at
least
hours,
then
it
went
to
one
hour,
and
then
to
nothing
realize
these
were
not
expensive,
but
wouldn't
have
spent
the
money
for
device
that
only
worked
well
for
the
first
three
months
and
limped
along
for
another
two
months
before
dying
completelyoriginal
review:
these
are
terrific
and
at
this
price
are
very
hard
to
do
better
have
normal,
small
ears
and
these
are
the
only
headphones
that
stay
in
my
ears
while
running
the
additional
movement
allowed
with
wireless
headphones
is
so
nice:
you
can
put
your
phone
anywhere
within
feet
or
probably
further,
and
you
can
turn
your
head
without
having
them
fall
out
they
were
charged
when
they
arrived
so
just
followed
the
simple
directions
to
pair,
and
was
done
the
directions
are
easy
to
follow,
and
while
running
can
easily
touch
the
correct
button
to
raise/lower
volume,
skip
songs,
etc
for
comparison,
my
hands
are
medium
for
woman
the
headphones
cancel
noise
so
well
that
can
hear
anything
else
around
me
if
listening
to
music
in
fact,
still
use
my
wired
headphones
when
need
to
hear
surrounding
noise
like
kids
and
such
and,
the
quality,
durability
and
sturdiness
of
these
headphones
is
impressive
got
these
to
have
back
up
for
when
forget
to
charge
my
other
headphones,
but
in
all
honesty,
these
will
now
be
my
main
set
first
of
all
these
sound
good,
always
test
out
song
with
really
good
bass
to
see
how
they
hold
up
was
happy
with
that
they
are
bit
chunky,
they
stick
out
of
my
ear
more
than
my
other
ones,
but
they
are
comfortable,
and
they
do
stay
in
well
like
that
they
send
all
different
size
of
the
tips
and
the
ear
hook
ones
as
well,
so
no
matter
what
you
can
get
combination
that
works
for
your
ear
like
the
flexibility
of
the
cord,
my
old
set
gets
very
stiff
and
can
be
annoying
when
wearing
them
and
the
magnetic
part
is
great
for
when
you
have
to
take
both
out
for
few,
and
don't
want
to
lose
or
drop
them
i'm
particularly
good
at
dropping
electronic
thingsit
comes
with
bag
to
store
them
in,
would
prefer
hard
case,
as
my
old
set
has,
for
protection,
but
bag
is
better
than
nothing
or
just
buy
little
case
separately
the
charging
cord
is
very
short,
depending
on
where
you're
plugging
them
in
they're
going
to
be
hanging
off
the
outlet
they
were
extremely
easy
to
sync
up
to
my
phone,
exactly
the
same
process
as
my
old
set
so
that
was
good
like
these
lot,
will
probably
get
another
pair,
for
back
up
to
my
back
ups
lol
for
the
price
and
quality,
they
are
good
deal

to

know
this
is
hard
to
do
with
bluetooth
headphones
that
are
inexpensive,
but
the
earbuds
could
be
smaller
aka
not
stick
out
of
my
ears
so
far
they're
not
terrible
and
will
totally
get
used
to
it,
but
just
something
to
think
about
it
would
be
difficult
and
likely
very
uncomfortable
to
try
to
sleep
on
your
side
with
these
in
thinking
of
my
airplane
rides,
hereif
have
any
issues
in
the
future
with
these
headphones,
will
update
my
review
accordingly
can't
wait
to
put
these
to
the
test
absolutely
love
these
headphones
the
sound
quality
is
solid,
and
was
veeeeery
skeptical
considering
their
price,
but
they
do
not
disappoint
the
noise
cancelling
ability
is
impressive,
just
having
them
in
my
ears
no
music,
was
having
hard
time
hearing
much
around
me
they
fit
comfortably
and
offer
different
styles
and
sizes
of
the
earbud
part,
so
you
shouldn't
have
trouble
finding
what
works
for
you
also
love
the
magnetic
feature
at
first
didn't
think
much
of
the
feature,
and
certainly
didn't
expect
that
i'd
take
advantage
of
it
much
at
all,
but
it
really
has
come
in
handy
overall
i'd
say
these
are
totally
worth
it,
especially
if
you
get
the
$0
year
protection
plan
from
amazon
for
$0
you
have
ease
of
mind
knowing
that
if
for
any
reason
these
headphones
go
under
any
time
soon,
you're
covered
overall
highly
recommend
these
the
boltune
bluetooth
wireless
headphones
are
easy
to
recommend
to
anyone
because
they
do
exactly
as
advertised
they
are
comfortable
and
almost
feel
like
if
you
are
putting
some
ear
plugs
into
your
ears
from
them
being
inserted
they
create
good
seal
and
this
by
itself
adds
noise
isolationthe
audio
quality
is
decent
for
bluetooth
ear
piece
they
would
not
match
an
inline
ear
phones,
but
no
blue
tooth
headphones
would
at
this
timethe
build
is
good
it
feels
sturdy,
the
design
is
simplistic
but
there
is
attention
to
detail
you
could
walk
around
with
these
discretely
and
once
out
of
your
ears
the
magnets
work
pretty
well
they
are
strongthe
water
proof
or
water
resistant
capabilities
is
nice
mix
since
you
can
go
anywhere
with
this,
even
into
the
shower
the
bluetooth
range
is
pretty
good
as
well
and
may
only
stutter
if
elevation
is
change,
eg
going
up
steps
at
distancebased
on
the
above
it
is
easy
to
recommend
this
product
let
me
start
by
saying
that
almost
returned

just
placed
the
order
and
the
next
day
my

not
that
comfortable
and
wanted

added
comparison,

some
middle

sennheiser

music
in
general,
these,
in
my
opinion,
from
an
earbud
perspective,
run
petty

listen
to

of

and
today
put
them
to

recommend
these
absofreakinlutely
these
earphones
are
amazing
bought
two
pair
so
one
could
always
be
charging
six
days
ago,
couldn
find
one
of
them
while
bringing
groceries
in
from
the
car,
stumbled
over
the
missing
set
they
had
been
in
my
yard
for
six
days
but
wait,
it
gets
better
we
had
major
storm
that
lasted
three
days,
dumping
buckets
of
rain,
sleet,
and
snow,
with
temperatures
in
the
twenties
brought
them
inside
and
decided
to
charge
them
just
to
see:
they
work
no
damage
that
is
an
impressive
beating
and
they
still
run
like
new
for
the
price,
these
earphones
can
be
beat
the
sound
quality
is
good
not
quite
my
husband
bose
but
if
you
didn
know
the
difference,
you
never
know
you
re
missing
something
the
batteries
on
one
will
last
an
entire
saturday
through
cleaning,
laundry,
and
errands
love
them
have
bought
two
pairs
of
these
they
seemed
good
at
first,
but
both
pairs
eventually
suffered
from
glitch
wherein
they
constantly
disconnect/reconnect
to
the
bluetooth
device
in
an
endless
loop
tried
multiple
devices,
same
resultfurthermore,
with
both
pairs,
would
find
that
the
mic
would
randomly
stop
working
in
the
middle
of
call,
and
the
person
on
the
phone
couldn't
hear
me
at
allfinally,
the
first
pair
stopped
turning
on
at
all,
despite
being
fully
chargedcomplete
garbageupdate:
contacted
boltune
customer
service,
and
they
had
me
return
the
defective
unit
and
sent
replacement
within
couple
of
weeks,
the
replacement
unit
began
exhibiting
the
same
reconnection
loop
problem
this
is
my
third
pair
to
have
this
problem
tried
pairing
with
different
sources
android,
ios,
windows,
all
had
the
same
problemstill
complete
garbage
what
relief
they
definitely
measure
up
was
concerned
because
they're
not
the
most
expensive
but
they
sure
sound
lot
better
than
my
last
expensive
set
sound
quality
is
important
to
me
with
these,
could
hear
notes
and
instruments
that
couldn't
hear
in
my
last
set
and
the
battery
life
was
fantastic,
too
did
hr
cleaning
job
and
still
had
plenty
of
battery
left
afterward
as
for
staying
in
place,
they're
very
good
but
if
it's
possible,
i'd
like
to
see
some
improvement
clean
for
living
and
use
both
my
right
and
left
arm,
lot
of
twisting
from
one
side
to
the
other
because
of
sweat,
the
cord
grips
my
skin
and
can
cause
an
earbud
to
come
out
that's
not
an
issue
with
jogging
or
lifting
weights,
but
it
is
with
cleaning
for
living
only
occasionally
have
to
replace
it
in
my
ear,
so
i'm
ok
just
really
appreciate
the
great
sound,
especially
for
the
price
i'm
not
disappointed
really
love
these
headphones
and
it
seems
like
miracle
that
the
batteries
last
so
long,
however
have
recently
begun
having
problems
with
mine
use
these
lot
for
listening
to
podcasts
while
walking
the
dog
and
started
noticing
that
the
batteries
were
not
lasting
as
long
as
they
should
was
needing
to
charge
everyday
later
noticed
that
the
headphones
will
no
longer
charge
when
the
charger
is
connected,
instead,
the
charger
has
to
be
disconnected
and
reconnected
in
order
to
get
the
blue
"fully
charged"
light
this
is
hassle
and
quite
unfortunate
if
it
wasn't
for
the
issue,
would
have
easily
given
the
full
stars
these
are
incredible
for
the
price,
but
somehow
not
quite
worth
it
it's
shameupdate:
i'm
increasing
to
stars
since
customer
service
has
been
great
so
far
it
looks
like
will
be
given
refund
after
contacting
boltune
purchased
these
ear
buds
to
replace
pair
lost
when
they
original
ear
buds
weren
available
any
longer
so
far
these
earbuds
are
almost
identical
to
what
previously
had,
and
loved
they
came
fully
charged
and
were
very
easy
to
pair
to
my
phone
all
the
controls
power,
columns,
pause,
etc
are
the
same
as
what
previously
had,
and
am
very
pleased
for
my
use
these
are
perfect,
provide
some
noise
cancellation
but
not
enough
that
unable
to
hear
things/people
around
me
as
necessary
haven
used
them
for
long
enough
period
of
time
yet
to
run
down
the
battery,
but
anticipate,
based
on
all
other
factors,
that
the
listening
time
will
be
perfect
for
my
needs,
usually
hours
at
time
of
listening
to
an
audio
book
or
to
watch
something
streaming
on
netflix
very
happy
with
these
earbuds,
and
would
purchase
them
again
also
they
arrived
day
earlier
than
anticipated
which
was
terrific
as
well
completely
satisfied
with
my
purchase
was
little
skeptical
about
purchasing
these
because
they
were
little
on
the
"expensive"
end
to
me,
because
had
never
heard
of
the
boltune
brand
before
read
the
reviews
and
decided
to
try
them
out
based
on
such
other
positive
reviews
am
soooo
glad
purchased
these
the
sound
is
amazing
listen
to
alot,
alot
of
r&b,
rap,
hip
hop
and
the
bass
that
comes
through
these
are
omg
like,
once
these
stop
working
not
speaking
into
existence
lol
will
not
hesitate
to
purchase
new
pair
love
these
highly
recommend
them
the
sound
is
amazing,
the
battery
life
is
amazing,
the
hands
free/no
cord
is
amazing
they
also
are
water
resistant,
being
that
lots
are
expected
to
use
while
working
out
meaning
sweat
resistant
work
at
desk
all
day
long
so
listen
to
them
all
day
long
and
have
to
charge
them
every
other
day
some
may
not
listen
as
much
and
will
maybe
have
to
charge
every
days
i'm
impressed,
nevertheless,
because
of
how
much
abuse
mine
and
only
have
to
charge
every
other
day
lol
honestly,
get
them
:
did
hours
and
hours
of
research
on
this
style
of
headphones
and
finally
decided
to
go
with
theseand
so
glad
did
can
believe
how
amazing
these
wireless
earbuds
are
this
is
my
third
purchase
for
this
kind
of
wireless/bluetooth/magnetic
setup
and
these
ones
win,
hands
down
when
playing
music,
the
sound
was
clear
no
expert
about
sound,
but
was
surprised
how
much
bass
there
was
but
also
how
clear
the
words
were
it
felt
like
could
have
dance
party
right
there
battery
is
better
than
my
old
ones
ve
worn
them
for
hours
or
so
and
they
re
still
showing
they
have
more
than
0%
battery
to
go
wore
these
in
the
rain
today
and
while
sweating
profuselyabsolutely
no
issues
or
problems
the
magnets
are
strong
don
foresee
any
issues
or
problems
with
them
falling
off
there
are
small/medium/large
earbuds
and
small/medium/large
hooks
that
you
can
swap
out
for
perfect
fit
found
my
right
combination
and
then
gave
sharp
tug
on
the
wire
and
they
stayed
in
my
ears
just
fine
make
lot
of
phone
calls
for
work,
so
tested
the
mic
by
having
my
wife
call
me
while
she
used
these
earbuds
the
sound
was
just
as
good
as
using
the
actual
phone
no
echoes,
no
ringing,
no
weird
roboticvoice
junk
pretty
excited
about
this
because
my
old
earbuds
didn
have
the
best
mic
and
so
couldn
really
use
them
with
my
phone
with
the
right
earbuds
in,
the
noise
cancellation
was
just
what
needed
couldn
hear
anything
going
on
around
meall
in
all,
very
pleased
with
this
purchase
they
are
little
bigger
than
my
old
ones,
but
they
also
have
better
sound
and
bigger
battery,
so
that
expectedalso:
left
my
wife
listen
to
song
with
these
earbuds
and
she
started
dancing,
haha
and
she
was
so
impressed
with
them
that
she
asked
me
to
buy
her
pair
too
have
used
daily
since
purchased
lost
couple
of
ear
caps
and
found
them
on
floor
or
in
bed
but
otherwise
have
been
reliable
and
easy
to
use
battery
lasts
at
least
all
day,
maybe
two
days
if
part
of
the
time
is
on
standby
rather
than
playing
music,
news,
books,
or
participating
in
call
or
meeting
admittedly
don't
use
the
mic
much
i've
got
wired
mic
as
default
on
my
computer
for
the
better
sound
quality
and
less
rubbing
noise
battery
charges
at
least
part
way
fast
enough
that
it
doesn't
bother
me
much
when
the
battery
runs
out
it
gives
couple
of
verbal
warnings
before
it
shuts
off
just
charge
for
fifteen
minutes
to
an
hour
and
then
they
make
it
to
the
end
of
the
dayi
have
some
hearing
loss
and
sound
quality
in
the
range
of
voices
is
good
enough
for
me
honestly,
was
extremely
happy
about
the
headphones
at
firsti
had
bought
sets
of
head
phones
back
in
december/january
never
got
them
wet
or
damaged
but
for
some
reason,
they
occasionally
wouldn't
turn
on
after
charge
maybe
around
months
of
having
them
with
moderate
use
about
month
after
that,
they
all
together
just
stopped
turning
on
at
allthis
sadly
wasn't
happening
to
just
me
either
after
bought
these
headphones,
loved
them
the
sound
quality,
the
long
lasting
charge,
the
comfortable
fit,
and
the
magnets
even
gave
star
review
raving
about
them
which
only
leave
review
for
outstanding
products
that
love
not
only
that,
told
my
friends
about
them
and
lot
of
them
even
bought
these
but
now,
i'm
little
embarrassed
cause
all
of
theirs
are
doing
the
same
thing
after
few
months,
they
just
stop
turning
on
so
you
see
how
that
looks
on
meedit:
contacted
customer
support
and
they
sent
me
new
ones
i'll
keep
you
updated
this
is
my
first
set
of
earbuds
with
the
"wings"
to
hold
them
in
and,
after
trial
and
error
period,
find
much
prefer
them
to
the
over
the
ear
type
they
are
much
more
comfortable
and
stay
on
much
better
wear
these
all
day
long
listening
to
audiobooks
and
they
have
proven
to
hold
charge
for
0+
hours
impressive
have
never
run
out
of
battery
if
were
to
ask
for
anything
more,
it
would
be
to
change
the
charging
system
to
usb
all
my
other
headsets
used
this
micro
usb
charging
system
and
eventually
died
when
the
charging
port
became
damaged
and
would
no
longer
function
usb
seems
to
be
sturdier
choice
all
in
all
though,
for
the
price,
i'm
quite
happy
with
the
product
have
been
searching
for
stereo
bluetooth
headset
with
long
battery
life
for
some
time
tried
several
different
sets
that
advertised
0,0,0
hours
of
life
but
they
never
worked
out
always
about
the
same
hours
of
battery
lifethe
set
was
using
broke
and
so
was
looking
through
amazon
again
and
came
across
this
set,
have
to
admit
was
very
skeptical
of
the
battery
life
claims
but
they
met
my
other
criteria
with
respect
to
fit
and
size
so
figured
try
pairthey
arrived
yesterday,
and
had
about
0%
charge
so
started
using
them
right
away
first
thing
noticed
was
when
powering
them
on
the
"power
on,
bluetooth
pairing/connected"
announcement
was
at
"normal
volume"
and
not
the
usual
full
volume,
high
pitched
voice
that
i've
found
on
other
devices
no
tensing
up
for
an
audio
blast
when
powering
on
got
them
paired
and
started
playing
back
my
favorite
tunes,
sound
quality
is
excellent
to
me
and
the
ear
bud
tips
fit
right
out
of
the
box
the
controls
on
the
headset
were
easy
to
use
and
had
good
solid
feel,
no
"did
press
it
or
not"
guess
work,
and
so
far,
no
double
taps
on
the
controls
was
half
expecting
to
be
be
disappointed
with
battery
life
but
hours
later
and
they
were
still
going
strong
but
went
ahead
and
recharged
until
full
started
another
test
around
0pm,
played
tunes
all
night,
and
at
am
they
were
still
going
totally
unexpected
and
very
impressive,
especially
considering
the
earbuds
are
only
slightly
larger
than
my
last
set,
not
sure
where
they
pack
all
that
power
in
but
their
claim
of
0+
hours
of
playback
is
not
an
exaggeration
for
my
android
setup
am
very
pleased
with
my
purchase
and,
if
need
another
headset
down
the
road,
there
no
doubt
in
my
mind
what
i'll
be
buying
purchased
these,
as
was
looking
for
wireless
option
know
that
independent
ear
buds
are
not
good
idea
for
people
like
myself
tend
to
lose
small
items
like
that
this
is
like
having
traditional
earphones
that
are
wired,
but
you're
not
"plugged
in"
the
sound
from
these
are
very
high
quality
considering
the
price
the
ear
buds
themselves
are
comfortable
enough
to
wear
for
few
hours
before
you
need
to
take
them
out
and
let
your
ears
relax
battery
life
is
ridiculous
don't
know
that
i've
come
close
to
even
using
up
0%
of
the
battery
using
them
during
an
hour
shift
at
work
the
microphone
also
works
very
well,
i'm
lead
coordinator
at
my
job
and
run
meetings
using
these
colleagues
have
remarked
on
how
clear
my
voice
is
across
skype
and
teams
think
that
you
will
be
hard
pressed
to
find
better
quality
at
such
remarkable
value
these
buds
look
nice
and
sounds
pretty
good
for
under
$0
they
have
plenty
of
bass,
while
being
balanced
in
all
other
attributes
the
volume
is
adequate,
only
having
to
go
slightly
above
half
volume
without
having
to
change
the
ear
tips
they
are
not
uncomfortable
around
the
neck,
but
they
tend
to
dangle
around
the
back
when
moving
around,
and
it
created
bit
of
tugging
sensation
ultimately,
if
you
move
your
head
too
much,
one
of
the
ears
will
dislodge
using
only
one
earbud
can
be
bit
annoying,
and
there
is
nothing
to
keep
the
dangling
earbud
from
pulling
the
rest
of
the
wire
to
one
side,
unless
you
loop
it
around
your
neck
and
on
the
other
wire
of
the
earbud,
which
is
not
ideal
it
is
minor
flaw
though,
and
is
expected
with
earbuds
that
are
lacking
neckband
for
weight
overall,
they
are
solid
buy
and
worth
it
for
under
$0
pros
very
good
sound:
am
using
it
with
my
garmin
fenix
watch
and
mostly
up
to
0%
sound
is
already
great
and
strong
magnet
it
is
handy
if
you
are
using
it
often,
just
to
keep
it
on
your
neck
finally
do
not
use
it
as
much
as
thought
handy
"bar"
with
keys:
easily
increasing
volume,
changing
songs,
stop/start
battery:
good
life
overallcons
bulky
wire
during
running
it
is
jumping
and
creating
basslike
sounds
in
your
ear
after
every
jump/step
there
could
be
some
kind
of
adjustment
for
that
the
way
what
is
helping
lot
is
to
create
nod
behind
your
head,
so
it
will
not
jump
that
much
and
decrease
the
annoying
sound
"cheaper
design":
also
biggest
reason
is
the
bulky
wire
know
it
is
more
durable
but
here
would
appreciate
the
change
sometimes
during
run
jumping
from
my
ears:
might
be
caused
due
to
the
different
anatomy
or
again,
weight
of
the
wireregarding
the
price,
would
considered
$0
dollars
bit
overpriced,
but
with
$0
discount
coupon
it
is
still
good
deal
only
because
of
the
wire
finally
found
them:
earbuds
that
stay
in
place
am
new
to
running
summer
running
in
the
carolinas
involves
heat
and
sweat
have
another
set
of
buds
by
boltune
love
them
but,
for
the
summer
months,
need
buds
that
sound
great
and
won
fall
out
no
matter
how
much
sweat
or
move
–
these
stay
in
my
earsso,
here
the
scoop
on
overall
performance
the
sound
quality
is
great
they
allow
me
to
listen
to
my
music
and,
also
hear
things
in
my
surroundings
really
like
the
ease
of
the
controls
simple
and
straight
forward
–
push
once
for
volume
up,
hold
for
song
skip
once
they
are
paired
with
phone
–
they
automatically
sync
am
not
used
to
corded
set
of
earbuds
and
the
cord
weight
on
the
right
side
with
controls
feels
like
it
might
fall
out
it
is
something
need
to
get
used
to
the
most
important
thing
is
that
they
haven
fallen
off,
even
when
have
tried
to
shake
them
out
multiple
sizes
of
ear
pads
and
ear
clips
allowed
me
to
find
the
perfect
fit
use
medium
in
my
right
ear
and
small
in
the
left
haven
done
that
before
–
it
makes
difference
these
are
exactly
what
hoped
for
when
ordering
and
the
price
makes
them
such
great
value
can
wait
to
put
some
miles
on
these
originally
bought
pair
of
these
headphones
in
black
late
last
year,
but
then
my
bf's
headphone
jack
on
his
phone
broke
so
he
could
not
use
the
headphones
he
had
anymore
so
gave
him
my
pair
he
has
really
liked
these
headphones
and
kept
saying
would
buy
another
pair
for
myself
saw
that
this
year
they
came
out
with
ones
in
gray
and
decided
to
buy
another
pair
for
me
i've
had
them
for
couple
of
months
now
and
they
still
work
great
use
them
when
work
out
and
they
stay
in
pretty
good,
though
have
weird
ears
so
it's
hard
for
most
things
to
stay
in
they
are
easy
to
use
and
the
battery
life
has
been
very
long,
go
many
uses
before
have
to
recharge
them
did
hours
of
research
on
bluetooth
sport
earbuds
before
buying
my
first
pair
and
have
to
say
that
think
made
an
excellent
choice
love
the
little
carry
case
for
keeping
them
packed
up
with
the
charging
cord
all
in
all,
very
good
bluetooth
earbuds
for
the
price
bought
pairs
and
plan
to
buy
more
to
have
one
available
everywhere
need
one0
have
terrible
sweaty
ears
when
im
at
the
gym,
they
did
not
fall
down,
the
type
of
ear
support
is
very
good,
was
worry
it
will
be
unfomfortable
but
it
is
not
at
all0
the
sound
is
amazing0
super
light,
bearly
feel
them0
battery
life
is
awesome,
used
them
for
days,
honestly
forgot
when
charged
them
last,
im
very
pleased0
had
lg
before,
bought
for
around
$0,
and
these
one
are
by
far
the
best0
lets
not
talk
about
the
price,
you
cant
find
anything
better
for
this
price0
forgot,
they
are
waterproof
too,
think
my
lgs
went
bad
because
of
my
sweaty
ears
this
battery
lasts
foreeever
great
noise
cancelation
the
sound
quality
isn't
amazing,
but
they're
$0
don't
expect
the
best
but
i'm
not
an
audiophile
and
mostly
just
listen
to
podcasts
have
small
ears
and
these
fit
great
prefer
the
connected
wireless
headphones
rather
than
the
truly
wireless
because
they're
less
bulky
and
the
battery
life
is
better
like
that
these
fit
my
small
ears
and
don't
mean
just
the
squishy
bud
mean
the
hard
part
of
the
earbuds
that
sit
in
my
ear
auricle
don't
mind
that
the
truly
wireless
ones
tend
to
stick
out
lot
what
don't
like
about
them
is
that
the
hard
part
that
sits
in
my
outer
ear
is
usually
quite
large
to
hold
the
battery
love
that
these
have
the
mic
and
the
other
person
can
hear
me
clearly
on
calls
very
easy
to
use
and
play
music,
switch
songs,
redial
numbers,
hang
up,
volume
change
the
sound
quality
is
great
my
toddler
has
tantrums
so
decided
to
use
these
to
test
the
noise
cancelation;
guess
what
couldn't
hear
her
loud
drama
love
them
usually
her
screams
stress
me
out
and
have
to
discipline
her
now
can
let
her
have
her
meltdown
and
she
will
come
to
me
when
she
is
done
love
love
love
oh
and
they
are
super
lightweight
the
magnets
are
great
add
on
to
keep
them
on
throughout
the
day
bought
just
tested
them
next
to
loud
boombox
we
have
and
couldn't
hear
my
husband's
loud
music
while
listening
to
mine
ok
must
admit
was
tad
skeptical
of
all
the
star
reviews
but
am
glad
was
wrong
so
received
them,
charged
them
up
and
started
using
them
right
away
will
say
that
as
soon
as
put
them
on
knew
they
would
be
my
favorites
they
come
with
lots
of
sizes
for
your
eat
but
the
one
that
was
already
attached
was
perfect
for
my
ears
they
are
comfy
and
give
props
to
the
designer
of
these
they
fit
better
that
my
iphone
ear
pods
and
the
sound
quality
is
top
notch
and
they
really
cancel
out
outside
sounds
was
thinking
of
buying
the
wireless
apple
earpods
while
they
were
on
sale
but
wanted
to
try
these
before
spent
$0
am
so
glad
did
will
not
be
wasting
my
money
on
expensive
earpods
that
would
probably
end
up
getting
lost
highly
recommend
these
if
you
have
been
eyeballing
them
just
but
them
extremely
happy
with
these
had
different
brand
set
loved
and
used
for
years
but
very
disappointed
with
how
they
held
up
for
the
price
and
didn
care
for
what
they
have
and
price
so
after
reading
all
the
reviews
on
this
product
figured
it
was
worth
try
since
the
price
was
fantastic
and
it
had
great
return
policy
after
reading
all
the
good
reviews
on
this
product
figured
it
was
worth
trying
well
the
reviews
were
not
wrong
use
them
lot
in
the
garden
and
around
the
house
they
are
fantastic
for
audio
books,
podcasts,
music
and
even
talking
on
the
phone
so
much
so
that
purchased
another
set
for
my
husband
and
my
friend
even
purchased
set
for
herself
and
her
husband
ordered
these
earbuds
to
replace
pair
that
crapped
out
after
years
different
brand
really
liked
my
old
ones
and
was
looking
for
something
similar
these
fit
the
bill
as
they
seemed
very
light
use
them
primarily
for
working
out
did
not
want
the
headband
type
as
the
old
pair
had
would
fall
off
after
much
research
ordered
this
pair
they
came
promptly
there
was
bit
of
an
issue
with
pairing
as
some
also
have
noted
it
took
awhile
for
the
first
few
times
and
they
would
unpair
every
time
turned
them
off
however
after
contacting
the
company
and
having
them
explain
how
to
repair
more
easily
they
seem
to
work
lot
better
that
is
the
only
issue
had
and
the
reason
for
only
stars
hope
they
last
lot
longer
than
my
last
pair
simple
easy
points:price
is
definitely
pluseasy
setuplove
the
magnetic
featurevery
comfortablesound
is
great,
have
few
songs
always
test
on
my
earphones
these
tested
greatisolation
noise
is
great
if
am
with
someone
use
one
ear
so
don't
miss
the
conversation
the
buttons
are
not
hidden,
like
that
there
is
bit
of
button
feel
on
them
so
it
is
an
easy
feelgreat
battery
lifechanges
pretty
quicklydon't
have
any
idea
how
long
these
will
last
so
can't
comment
on
thatwish
their
warranty
was
bit
longerbecause
seem
to
have
no
luck
with
them
so
for
nowi
would
definitely
highly
recommend
these
earphones
recommend
these
earbuds
for
music
seeing
that
this
is
my
first
pair
of
wireless
headphones,
was
worried
if
they
would
stay
put
while
jogging,
and
with
the
variety
of
sizes
they
give
you
easily
found
the
perfect
fit
they
stayed
snug
while
jogging
also
love
the
sound
quality,
because
listen
to
hip
hop
music
and
enjoy
bass
these
did
not
disappoint
don't
have
anything
to
compare
them
too,
but
for
the
price,
i'd
say
you
can't
beat
it
the
only
downside
was
that
while
running
when
windy,
heard
the
wind,
but
the
sound
of
my
music
was
optimum
enough
that
it
wasn't
enough
to
bother
me
just
pointing
that
out
to
all
the
tech
experts
out
there
calls
were
easy
to
answer,
no
problems
there
am
completely
satisfied
with
the
product
got
for
the
amazing
price
:
great
value
bought
pair
for
my
wife
last
year
she
uses
them
every
day
when
the
ear
cushions
on
my
very
expensive
bose
bt
headphones
gave
out
again,
bought
these
for
less
than
what
it
would
have
cost
me
to
replace
the
ear
cushions
on
my
expensive
phonesif
could
make
wish,
would
wish
for
hour
battery
life
instead
of
the
0/0
hours
get
with
these
like
to
go
to
sleep
with
headphones
and
these
don't
last
the
entire
night
would
recommend
them
for
regular
users
and
friends,
as
long
as
they
don't
expect
them
to
play
for
hours
continuous
they
sound
great,
are
comfortable,
easy
to
pair
like
the
headline
says,
these
are
such
huge
hassle
every
time
you
turn
these
on,
you
have
to
enter
pairing
mode,
then
go
to
your
bluetooth
settings
on
your
iphone,
tell
it
to
forget
this
device,
then
wait
for
them
to
show
up
again
which
takes
much
longer
than
any
other
headphones
have
ever
used
simply
do
not
have
time
to
go
through
this
hassle
every
time
turn
my
headphones
on
and
off
back
they
gowhat
terrible
design
have
very
sensitive
ears,
and
most
sports
earbuds
are
either
uncomfortable,
painful,
don
fit,
or
one
of
the
abovethese
are
incredibly
comfortable
very
easy
to
sync
they
stay
in
pretty
damn
wellmy
only
real
complaint
is
that
the
sound
quality
with
calls
seems
to
vary
there
also
something
of
static
sound
that
plays
sometimes
when
there
on
it
may
just
be
my
pair
might
have
to
return
them
for
different
one,
but
ll
give
it
bit
more
of
tryside
note,
was
mildly
disappointed
in
how
little
they
block
noise
know
they
re
not
advertised
as
noise
cancelling—there
$0
pair
by
boltune
that
is
identical
to
this
with
noise
cancelling
added—but
hoped
they
would
bit
that
was
gamble
took,
though,
and
can
always
upgrade[full
disclosure:
was
chosen
to
receive
$0
amazon
gift
card
for
an
honest
review
in
the
few
days
that
i've
been
using
these
headphones
they
strike
me
as
quality
product
easy
pairing,
good
range,
fair
battery
life,
etc
the
answer/end
call
and
volume
buttons
are
very
convenient
and
the
magnetic
connectors
are
nice
touch
however
personally
can
barely
tolerate
wearing
these
for
significant
lengths
of
time
because
they
cause
me
pain
and
discomfort
even
though
i'm
grown
woman
these
do
not
fit
me
have
small
ears
and
most
earbuds
will
not
stay
in
my
ears,
but
given
that
these
come
with
small,
medium,
and
large
sized
rubber
covers
thought
could
give
them
try
even
the
smallest
size
did
not
do
the
trick,
the
base
that
the
covers
go
on
is
just
too
large
included
pictures
showing
how
just
the
small
rubber
cap
fits
comfortably
in
my
ear
by
itself,
and
you
would
see
that
it
is
not
its
original
round
shape,
but
rather
squished
of
course
the
round
earbuds
themselves
do
not
squish,
and
so
causes
soreness
in
my
ear
not
being
fitted
properly
will
probably
give
these
to
my
big
eared
boyfriend,
and
try
to
find
something
else
for
myself
these
are
the
most
comfortable
backofneck
style
headphones
i've
worn
the
sound
cancellation
is
pretty
great
without
that
weird
suction
feeling
in
your
ears
that
some
buds
create
the
mic/control
part
is
also
very
light
which
adds
to
the
comfort
i've
found
that
part
on
other
headphones
of
this
style
are
heavy
and
make
the
strap
sit
weird
on
my
neck,
but
not
these
stereo
sound
quality
is
good
they
also
come
in
nice
carrying
pouch
which
will
be
great
for
throwing
them
into
my
carryon
when
fly
the
only
potential
downside
is
that
the
ear
pieces
do
stick
out
of
the
ear
quite
bit,
like
almost
an
inch
if
that
bothers
you
have
not
yet
tested
the
mic
quality
overall,
they
seem
like
great
quality
headphone
at
this
price
point
got
these
day
ago
packaging
was
great,
product
design
looks
sharp,
was
able
to
use
right
away
comfortable
fit,
easy
to
switch
out
the
provided
fit
sizes
so
it
fits
custom
was
really
happy
with
the
range
was
able
to
be
at
least
0ft
in
different
rooms
from
my
phone
without
it
loosing
connection
which
is
huge
improvement
from
my
last
set
by
different
brand
still
testing
my
max
range
the
magnetic
locks
are
strong,
again
an
improvement
from
my
last
set
by
different
brand
charging
cord
is
strong
and
durable,
only
set
back
is
wish
the
charger
cord
was
tad
bit
longer
overall,
excellent
product
for
reasonable
price
highly
recommend
struggled
with
another
brand
of
similar
headphones
because
the
volume
and
pause/power
button
was
so
heavy,
it
was
always
pulling
the
earbud
out
of
my
little
ears
tried
these
and
instantly
felt
the
comfort
and
relief
in
how
light
they
are
use
them
daily
listening
to
podcasts
while
walk
minutes
in
the
mornings
these
headphones
are
really
great
good
sound,
lightweight,
long
battery
life,
adjustable
fit
ear
piecesi
just
purchased
my
second
pair
after
the
ones
used
and
abused
for
well
over
year
were
finally
in
need
of
replacement
highly
recommend
these
especially
if
apple
headphones
are
way
too
big
for
you
and
will
be
purchasing
more
for
family
as
stocking
stuffers
these
are
my
first
bluetooth
wireless
earbuds
normally
just
get
the
regular
ones
but
wanted
change
i've
only
had
them
for
couple
of
days
now,
but
so
far
am
happy
with
them
like
that
they
have
different
sizes
in
case
you
need
to
change
the
ones
that
they
came
with,
which
did
have
to
do
different
size
they
stay
in
my
ears
well
and
block
out
most
of
the
noise
around
me
it
didn't
take
very
long
to
charge
them
up
just
used
the
small
usb
cable
that
they
came
with
and
hooked
it
up
to
my
computer
within
few
hours,
they
were
charged
i've
connected
them
to
my
computer
and
to
my
cell
phone
and
they
worked
great
even
tried
out
the
microphone
which
worked
very
well
reasonably
priced
and
would
recommend
this
is
one
of
the
best
bluetooth
headphones
that
have
used
until
now,
really
love
the
sound
quality
and
how
comfortable
it
is
and
wear
it
for
hours,
and
the
battery
life
is
amazing,
dont
need
to
charge
it
every
day,
can
go
days
without
charging
it,
and
im
listening
to
music
and
podcasts
all
the
time,
especially
love
the
charging
port
it
closes
so
perfectly
and
the
plastic
cover
doesnt
pop
up
every
time
after
your
done
charging
it,
which
was
very
annoying
on
my
last
bluetooth
headphones,
have
used
atleast
other
brands
within
the
past
year
and
they
either
broke
apart
or
just
stopped
working
completely
have
had
similar
style
of
inear
headphones
but
lost
themreceived
them
in
about
day
with
prime
shipping
the
packaging
was
minimal
just
what
was
necessary
which
is
always
appreciated
included
also
was
charging
cable,
carry
pouch,
and
multiple
ear
tips
s/m/l
was
able
to
get
good
fit
swapping
out
the
cord
is
short
around
the
back
of
the
neck
they
do
stick
out
of
the
ears
bit
and
the
controls
make
the
right
side
bit
uneven
in
terms
of
weight,
but
nothing
detrimentalwith
ios
the
battery
level
is
visible
on
the
widgettested
the
sound
with
music
metal,
youtube
videos,
and
audiobook
sound
is
great,
especially
at
this
price
pointwith
music
getting
nice
balance
between
low
end
and
mids
voice
on
youtube
and
audiobooks
came
through
nice
and
clear
been
using
these
headphones
for
four
months
now
they
replaced
two
pairs
was
using
because
live
in
headphones
have
lot
of
medical
issues
and
headphones
help
me
stay
grounded,
separate
myself
from
others
and
drama
and
whatever
may
be
distracting
me
from
much
needed
inner
calm
had
to
have
two
before
because
the
battery
didn't
last
long
enough
in
one
now
with
these
new
headphones
can
go
all
day,
and
night,
even
still
after
four
months
easy
to
charge,
great
for
phone
calls,
while
driving
can
still
hear
everything
else
and
even
sleeping
shoot
all
my
youtube
videos
with
them
too
good
quality,
great
functionality
highly
recommend
update:
few
weeks
after
posting
my
review
was
contacted
by
the
seller
and
they
worked
with
me
to
resolve
any
and
all
issuesthere
was
an
issue
with
my
original
unit,
but
it
has
been
resolved
there
is
no
such
thing
as
perfect
product
and
it
is
customer
service
that
makes
up
the
difference
was
not
looking
for
such
largess,
but
they
really
do
want
their
customers
to
be
made
whole
and
happynow
that
have
established
positive
relationship,
i'll
be
happy
to
do
much
more
business
with
this

been
using
it
for
about
four
months
on
my
new
a0
samsung
phone
and
it
keeps
disconnectingbeyond
irritating
have
purchased
several
different
brands
both
expensive
and
cheap
think
the
sound
quality
is
just
as
good,
if
not
better
than
my
beats
earbuds
bought
little
over
year
ago
those
earbuds
bit
the
dust
after
barely
being
used
they
would
not
even
charge
unfortunately,
instead
of
being
able
to
use
my
warranty,
my
cat
got
ahold
of
them
and
ate
the
cord,
which
wouldn
be
covered
on
the
warranty
anyway
had
to
do
something
different,
but
refuse
to
spend
fortune
on
earbuds
after
that
experience
have
now
owned
these
for
about
month
use
them
at
least
half
of
every
single
day
and
have
only
charged
them
every
other
day
that
extremely
important
since
my
beats
only
lasted
few
hours
if
used
consistently
and
even
when
they
weren
being
used,
they
only
lasted
about
hours
before
another
charge
was
needed
the
only
thing
don
like
about
these
headphones
is
there
unequal
weight
distribution
the
controls
are
on
one
side,
like
lot
of
earbuds
like
this,
but
there
no
weight
in
the
middle
to
keep
them
from
slipping
on
the
weighted
side
usually
have
one
in
and
one
out
so
can
hear
people
if
needed
they
fall
on
the
other
side
and
tighten
around
the
back
of
my
neck
while
the
other
side
is
hanging
practically
down
to
my
stomach
you
get
the
idea
for
that
reason,
give
them
stars
other
than
that,
am
pretty
satisfied
with
this
purchase
and
recommend
them
based
on
the
sound
quality,
lightweight
feel,
and
long
battery
life
these
headphones
are
comfortable
with
great
sound
quality
i've
owned
lot
of
these
necklace
style
magnetic
wireless
earbuds
and
these
were
hands
down
the
best
they
really
do
fit
nicely
and
produce
great
quality
the
waterproofing
seemed
to
be
good
i've
gotten
these
wet
many
times
and
that
didn't
seem
to
affect
things
that's
the
positive
sideon
the
negative
side
unfortunately,
the
microphone
never
worked
very
well
most
of
the
time
when
would
take
calls
using
these
headphones
the
other
person
couldn't
hear
me
tested
these
side
by
side
with
couple
of
other
wireless
headphones
have
and
determined
that
it
was
in
fact
the
microphone
in
this
pair
on
some
rare
days,
the
microphone
worked
fine
this
was
big
problem
since
take
calls
using
wireless
headphones
lot
even
worse,
these
stopped
working
completely
after
about
months
they
stopped
holding
charge
for
while,
then
shortly
after
they
simply
don't
turn
on
or
pairoverall
decent
listening
experience
while
they
worked
but
they
didn't
last
very
long
and
the
microphone
never
workededit:customer
support
got
in
touch
and
were
incredibly
helpful
in
sending
along
replacement
given
the
sound
quality
of
the
product
and
the
helpfulness
of
the
company,
changing
the
review
to
reflect
their
service
awesome
headphones
didn't
expect
much
from
them
just
needed
cheap
set
for
work
but
these
are
fantastic,
great
sound,
good
connection
to
my
phone,
easy
to
use
and
great
fit
in
my
ear,
work
in
large
food
manufacturing
plant
and
if
leave
my
phone
these
stay
connected
to
my
phone
from
half
way
through
the
plant
before
it
starts
cutting
out
only
down
sides
i've
found
were
they
are
little
heavy
compared
to
some
other
hps
but
that's
also
the
reason
for
the
great
sound
bigger
magnets
better
speaker
movement,
and
for
some
reason
my
phone
asks
me
every
time
connect
bluetooth,
if
want
to
connect
instead
of
just
connecting
like
my
other
bluetooth
stuff
prosthese
earbuds
provide
good
quality
for
low
price
and
have
0hour
battery
life
that
makes
them
an
exceptional
value
like
that
they
are
water
resistant
as
tend
to
use
them
outside
often
they
can
connect
to
more
than
one
device
at
time
making
switching
from
my
iphone
to
the
ipad
breeze
sound
quality
is
good
and
the
magnetic
feature
helps
to
prevent
loss
when
they
are
just
hanging
around
my
neck
perfect
for
video
watching
or
computer
workconsear
hook
does
not
stay
where
put
it
they
are
bit
heavy
for
my
small
ears
so
am
often
adjusting
them,
so
can
use
them
when
am
doing
anything
where
get
my
hands
dirty
also,
use
headphones
or
earbuds
at
night
for
sleep
and
these
are
too
hard
and
big
to
accommodate
sidelying
position
have
been
using
the
headphones
mainly
when
exercise
at
the
gym
got
tired
of
dealing
with
the
wired
sets
but
did
not
want
to
spend
over
$0
on
apple
air
pods
these
are
easy
to
use
and
stay
in
my
ear
comfortably
they
are
little
large
but
do
not
bother
me
like
the
fact
they
are
wired
together,
are
magnetized
and
have
convenient
mesh
bag
for
storage
they
seem
to
keep
the
charge
well,
but
am
careful
to
turn
them
off
when
not
using
them
the
sound
quality
is
fine
for
my
purpose,
mainly
podcasts
you
can
adjust
the
volume
and
turn
them
on
or
off
from
switch
in
the
wired
part
if
you
want
great
sound
quality
for
music,
you
should
probably
spend
the
$$
to
get
higher
quality
headphones
not
sure
about
the
noise
cancellation
vs
other
devices
can
still
hear
the
music
tracks
at
the
gym
when
wear
them
overall,
they
work
well
and
are
good
buy
would
buy
them
again
so
after
wondering
what
ear
buds
to
use
tried
few
wanted
something
could
work
with
in
the
metal
shop
and
while
running
lawn
equipment
these
earbuds
fit
better
than
buds
without
wire
connecting
them
the
wire
may
not
be
for
you
but
like
having
it
to
secure
them
around
my
neck
as
they
magnet
together
playtime
is
quite
long
haven't
actually
timed
them
but
know
they
are
all
of
0+
hours
on
charge
sound
quality
is
amazing
evening
while
running
machines
in
the
shop
and
equipment
outside
these
buds
seal
well
to
the
ear
and
block
out
lot
of
noise
though
not
osha
approved
they
work
very
well
don't
hesitate
to
try
them
for
the
price
they
are
awesome
don't
be
fooled
by
the
price,
these
headphones
are
amazing
i'm
total
audiophile
and
am
constantly
listening
to
podcasts,
music,
or
the
radio
on
my
phone
this
was
my
first
bluetooth
headset
and
i'm
blown
away
by
the
quality
the
battery
life
had
held
up
over
the
months
i've
owned
them
even
after
daily
use
and
the
quality
has
as
wellafter
buying
these
headphones,
by
brother
bought
bigger
brandname
set
of
headphones
for
me,
and
the
quality
just
did
not
hold
up
when
this
pair
bought
inevitably
dies,
will
be
buying
another
pair
these
are
the
best
bang
for
your
buck,
but
also
the
best
bluetooth
headphones
all
around
am
so
incredibly
happy
bought
these
the
sound
quality
is
crisp
and
clear
and
the
bass
is
strong
took
them
to
the
gym
yesterday
did
cardio
for
minutes
and
they
stayed
secure
the
entire
time
my
gym
is
big
and
echoy,
and
they
also
play
music
over
the
loud
speakers
when
started
playing
music
through
these
headphones,
all
of
the
outside
noise
went
away
you
can
still
hear
little
noise
between
songs
but
once
your
music
starts
playing,
total
noise
cancellation
listen
to
lot
of
pop,
rap,
r&b
and
the
bass
is
great
for
that
am
shocked
how
great
of
value
these
are
for
the
price
point
also
very
nice
that
can
just
put
my
phone
in
my
pocket
since
they
are
wireless
0/0
recommend
i've
never
used
earbuds
because
they've
never
fit
in
my
small
ears
my
set
arrived
yesterday
and
i'm
very
impressed
with
the
packaging,
the
bud
options
and
instructions
actually
ended
up
keeping
the
size
already
on
the
earbuds
but
appreciate
the
smaller
options
and
handy
travel
bag
for
everything
it
charged
and
synced
easily
and
i've
been
using
them
already
didn't
quite
understand
how
the
magnet
ends
would
be
until
had
them
around
my
neck
it's
such
great
feature
to
keep
them
handy
and
secure
while
not
in
use
so
happy
to
have
new
earbuds
these
headphones
come
well
packaged
to
ensure
protection
of
the
product
it
includes
charging
cable
and
several
different
ear
bud
sizes
to
fit
you
needs
the
use
of
the
headphones
are
pretty
easy
with
multifunction
button
that
basically
does
everything
powering
on/off,
answering
calls
etc
and
volume
buttonscons:although
the
quality
is
really
nice
and
sturdy,
trying
to
fit
the
earbuds
into
my
ears
was
struggle
even
the
smallest
size
had
to
be
jammed
in
for
it
to
fit
so
long
wear
of
these
is
bit
uncomfortableother
than
that
recommend
these
compared
to
those
of
higher
price
point
so
far,
so
very
good
much
better
sound
than
had
dared
to
expect
poweful
bass
and
good
high
pitches
fits
well
in
the
ears
and
connects
easily
via
bt
to
my
iphone
promax
the
magnetic
feature
is
great,
in
order
to
keep
them
around
the
neck
whilst
when
not
in
use
the
cord
can
be
little
bothering,
but
the
cons
weigh
more
too
early
to
judge
the
battery
life,
but
yet
it
loks
promising
for
this
price,
would
never
change
them
for
iphone
earbuds,
or
other
overpriced
products
overall,
they
look
and
feel
sturdy
very
happy
with
this
purchase,
and
i'm
not
getting
paid
for
this
review
just
my
humble
opinion
therefore
can't
understand
why
the
reviews
only
get
on
fakespotcom
there
shouldn't
be
any
reasons
for
faking
reviews
on
this
product
quality
product,
fast
shipping,
easy
connection,
superb
sound,
noise
cancellinglike
most
people
forced
to
work
from
home
during
this
crisis,
my
wife
is
online
most
of
the
day
video
conferencingbefore
getting
these
"boltune"
headsets,
she
was
struggling
with
the
confines
of
wired
product,
restricting
her
movements
she
found
it
very
frustratingtwo
days
after
ordering
the
"boltunes"
arrived
the
bluetooth
connection
worked
flawlesslythe
sound
and
noise
cancelling
feature
made
her
efforts
much
more
acceptableshe's
absolutely
satisfied
and
so,
"happy
wife,
happy
life
have
two
pairs
the
first
was
great
so
got
another
pair
when
the
first
wore
out
the
second
pair
has
an
obvious
decrease
in
bluetooth
quality
the
signal
does
not
reach
nearly
as
far
sometimes
just
having
my
body
orientated
wrong
will
cause
the
sound
to
break
up
i've
had
times
when
the
phone
is
in
my
pocket
and
the
sound
breaks
up
my
first
pair
*never*
had
that
issuesound
quality
is
great
for
someone
who
doesn't
really
care/notice
aka
me
call
quality
is
also
good
buttons
are
easy
to
access
and
they
fit
well
in
the
ear
battery
is
good
enough
for
most
of
the
day
at
work
and
into
the
evening,
listening
0%
of
that
timeedited:
manufacturer
reached
out
to
me
when
they
read
this
review
they
sent
me
replacement
item
free
of
charge
and
with
extremely
little
effort
on
my
part
all
they
wanted
was
the
order
number
and
my
address
so
if
had
to
point
out
the
best
feature
it's
the
sound
bought
this
to
listen
to
audible
at
night
for
the
price
think
the
clarity
and
bass
beat
my
more
expensive
jbl
also
the
battery
is
way
better
can
go
to
sleep
twice
and
still
be
above
percent
the
ear
pieces
could
be
little
less
deep
but
if
you're
not
side
sleeper
or
using
it
for
bed
it's
perfect
they
do
give
you
jersey
like
bag
keep
it
in
and
the
magnets
on
the
ear
pieces
are
stronger
than
my
jbl
treble
is
little
tinny
when
people
are
shrieking
but
overall
pretty
good
if
you
want
nice
pair
of
earbuds
these
are
definitely
it
bought
these
to
replace
my
favorite
earbuds
that
died
the
sound
quality
is
adequate
for
the
price
i'm
very
sensitive
to
sounds
and
probably
being
persnickety
my
only
complaint
is
the
cord
is
flat
and
stiff
so
it
bounces
when
jog,
hits
me
in
the
face/neck
sometimes
my
old
pair
was
thin
round
wire
that
laid
flat
otherwise,
i'm
very
happy
with
them
so
far,
the
battery
has
lasted
weeks
~0
hours
and
is
only
at
0%
they
connect
to
my
phone
with
no
issues
and
the
back/forward/pause/play
buttons
work
great
had
to
try
few
different
combinations
before
finding
the
perfect
fit
they
do
not
fall
out
or
jiggle
loose
when
jog
these
are
excellent
bluetooth
headphones
costing
around
$0
you
can
go
wrong
once
you
find
the
correct
fit
the
sound
is
very
good
with
nice
bass
they
stay
together
with
the
magnetic
connection
and
have
decent
built
in
mic
when
they
turn
onthey
will
tell
you
what
level
the
battery
is
would
say
the
playing
time
is
pretty
close
to
hours
depending
on
how
loud
you
have
it
you
get
good
noise
reduction
if
you
have
them
tight
with
good
suction
in
your
ear
could
do
work
outside
and
cars
within
feet
could
barely
hear
you
do
not
have
to
turn
it
up
loud
to
hear
them
well
the
only
issue
will
be
when
you
turn
your
head
the
wire
can
get
caught
on
your
clothing
not
really
big
deal
for
me
they
also
offer
an
extended
warranty
to
months
by
registering
the
device
these
are
great
bluetooth
headphones
to
enjoy
for
years
hopefully
if
don
break
them
take
care
god
bless
and
enjoy
the
music
glad
got
these
instead
of
the
totally
wireless
earbuds
better
sound
and
longer
battery
life
and
no
syncing
issues
with
the
other
earbud
the
sound
quality
is
exceptional,
enough
for
me
to
write
about
bought
another
pair
wired
pair
at
twice
the
price
thought
the
quality
would
be
better
given
that
it
was
both
twice
the
price
and
wired
was
wrong
this
pair
beat
it
and
from
my
experience
has
beat
every
other
pair
have
had
now,
am
not
super
audiophile,
so
this
may
not
mean
much
for
those
with
more
sophisticated
taste
that
is
willing
to
pay
big
bucks
for
sound
but
am
experienced
enough
to
know
that
this
pair
is
outstanding
for
the
price
am
grateful
for
the
purchase,
and
would
recommend
to
others
who
want
relatively
inexpensive
pair
of
earbuds,
that
sound
like
really
good
was
surprised
by
how
comfortable
these
headphones
fit
as
well
as
the
length
of
the
battery
life
use
them
to
lesion
to
podcast
at
work
and
they
are
perfect
for
that
as
well
as
using
for
music
do
not
get
the
ringing
ears
that
have
gotten
from
previous
headphones
that
push
to
much
treble
another
nice
feature
is
the
magnets
on
the
back
of
the
headphones
are
nice
to
connect
them
around
your
neck
when
not
in
use
they
are
light
enough
that
you
can
easily
forget
that
you
have
them
on
the
inline
controls
are
helpful
for
starting
and
stopping
what
your
lessening
to
when
you
need
to
talk
to
someone
own
few
of
this
type
of
bluetooth
earbuds
aukey
and
anker
are
the
other
two
have
picked
these
up
on
sale
for
$0
these
are
very
similar
to
my
other
ones
i'm
not
an
audiophile,
so
don't
have
detailed
listening
notes
they
seem
clear,
my
music
sounds
good,
and
voices
are
clear
don't
notice
any
distracting
extraneous
soundsthey
came
with
0%
charge,
which
was
nice
they
paired
easily
with
my
pixel
0xlone
thing
didn't
notice
until
got
them
was
that
they
have
flat
antitangle
type
cord
between
the
earbuds
when
first
took
them
out
of
the
package,
the
cord
was
stiff
and
seemed
to
have
some
memory,
so
she
put
the
earbuds
in,
the
cord
sort
of
crumpled
up
under
my
chin
but
just
laid
them
flat
for
little
bit,
and
the
cord
hangs
normally
nowoverall,
good
earbuds
for
good
price
sound
gets
them
stars,
but
for
the
sound
at
this
price,
they
get
my
husband
uses
these
cause
he
is
almost
deaf
and
can't
hear
the
tv
without
using
bluetooth
we
have
bluetooth
transmitter
so
we
can
pair
these
ear
phones
to
it
and
works
great
he
can
even
control
his
own
volume
the
main
seller
for
me
was
the
hrs
play
time
they
are
comfortable
in
the
ear,
lightweight
around
the
neck
and
not
complicated
for
hubby
to
use
do
wish
these
came
with
longer
usb
cord
though,
the
cord
is
only
about
or
inches
these
do
come
with
extra
ear
pieces
and
cute
little
carry
pouch
to
store
while
traveling
maybe
buy
on
average
around
pairs
of
headphones
year
work
at
home
and
have
been
an
avid
book
listener
for
almost
years
can
count
how
may
pairs
of
headphones
have
gone
threw
in
that
timesince
went
to
wireless
feel
like
ve
had
to
buy
pair
almost
every
other
month
or
so,
and
need
at
least
pairs
to
get
threw
the
day
listen
to
books
all
day,
weather
buy
$0
dollar
pair
or
$0
pairwell,
these
headphones
have
become
my
new
favorite
they
are
comfortable,
have
good
sound
quality
and
what
feel
is
even
more
important
last
forever
have
been
using
them
for
almost
week
and
haven
drained
the
batteries
yet
still
use
my
backup
headphones
for
sleep
my
husband
snores
and
use
that
time
to
charge
my
boltunes,
but
that
after
using
them
from
around
0am
to
around
midnight
love
them
needed
new
pair
of
running
headphones
and
almost
didn't
buy
these
since
had
been
burned
on
cheap
bluetooth
headphones
before
previously
bought
$0
mx0
headphones
and
they
died
twice
and
didn't
stay
in
my
ear
these
boltune
headphones
fit
in
my
ear
much
better
than
the
other
headphones
bought,
have
much
better
sound
quality,
and
are
infinitely
easier
to
pair
with
any
device
love
that
they
have
magnets
in
the
earbud
so
that
when
take
them
out
they'll
click
together
around
my
neck
like
necklace
meaning
they
won't
fall
off
or
get
lost
when
don't
have
them
in
my
ears
the
sound
quality
rivals
my
bose
soundsport
headphonesif
had
to
say
something
negative
about
the
headphones
it
would
be
that
they
don't
display
the
battery
life
or
tell
me
their
battery
life
that
said,
i've
never
had
them
run
out
of
power
during
use
just
charge
them
every
once
in
while
to
make
sure
they're
at
0%
when
need
themoverall,
would
say
these
headphones
are
an
amazing
purchase
because
you
get
high
quality
sound
for
very
low
price
the
functionality,
fit,
and
wear
is
great
and
rivals
highdollar
headphones
i'm
absolutely
recommending
these
to
friends
and
would
buy
again
if
these
headphones
ever
die
had
to
replace
an
older
wireless
earphone
from
different
brand
that
lasted
me
for
solid
years
of
use,
which
was
great
but
they
no
longer
sell
the
same
model
found
boltune
and
it
worked
for
solid
weeks
and
went
kaput
missed
the
return/exchange
period
with
amazon
so
emailed
customer
support
they
provided
way
to
reset
the
device
followed
the
instructions
and
it
worked
again
for
week,
then
went
completely
kaput
again
but
they
quickly
sent
me
new
replacement
and
hopefully
this
one
lasts
me
for
at
least
year
or
twogreat
customer
support
and
excellent
product
fingers
crossed
this
one
lasts
i've
purchased
boltune
earbuds
in
the
past
and
they
have
been
great
especially
like
the
battery
life
on
these
unfortunately,
recently
purchased
two
earbud
sets
and
both
earbud
sets
have
an
annoying
defect
every
time
in
turn
the
set
off,
then
on,
have
to
pair
the
earbud
set
to
my
phone
again
it's
annoying
hope
these
are
defects
and
not
how
the
new
botune's
are
supposed
to
work
will
be
returning
both
as
defective
and
i'm
not
sure
will
purchase
again
because
i'm
afraid
new
earbuds
will
be
the
same
have
been
looking
for
headphones
with
good
battery
life
for
work
and
yard
work
and
so
far
these
are
the
best
quality
for
the
price
i'm
going
on
hours
of
non
stop
play
time
and
there
is
no
indication
they
are
running
out
soonsound
quality
is
good
and
i'm
pleased
at
the
variety
of
ear
pieces
they
send,
found
very
comfortable
size
and
i'm
having
no
issues
with
them
falling
out
or
causing
too
much
ear
strain,
even
though
i've
been
working
in
the
garden
all
morningi
love
these
so
much
but
they
broke
am
pretty
sure
got
the
warranty
but
cant
figure
out
how
to
make
claim
i'm
fairly
tough
on
ear
buds
and
headphones,
and
tend
to
buy
cheaper
ones
when
ordering
online
haven't
had
this
headset
for
long,
but
it's
already
left
great
first
impression
it
paired
with
my
iphone
no
problem,
and
like
that
there's
only
three
buttons
to
worry
about
the
sound
quality
is
great
for
music
and
talking
on
the
phone,
and
the
earbuds
actually
stay
in
place
and
are
very
comfortable
the
noise
cancellation
is
almost
too
good
for
such
an
affordable
headset
apparently
missed
when
my
husband
was
trying
to
get
my
attention
from
the
next
room
when
usually
have
radar
ears
also
really
like
the
magnets
to
keep
them
connected
around
my
neck
so
don't
lose
themthe
best
comparison
can
give
is
to
similar
headset
that
got
in
subscription
box
that
retailed
for
approximately
$0
that
headset
had
horrendous
battery
life
and
would
die
after
one
normal
walk
with
my
dogs
around
the
neighborhood
it
had
similar
design
to
this
headset
two
earbuds
connected
by
flexible
"string",
and
the
weight
of
the
little
box
of
buttons
kept
making
it
shift
to
the
right
and
not
stay
in
place
it
also
had
plastic
"hooks"
on
the
earbuds,
similar
to
the
rubber
hooks
on
this
headset
those
plastic
hooks
broke
almost
immediately,
while
the
ones
on
this
headset
are
flexible
and
comfortable
i've
had
none
of
those
problems
with
this
headsetoverall,
i'm
super
impressed
after
buying
these
sight
unseen
definitely
great
value
do
have
to
say
these
are
by
far
one
of
the
most
inexpensive
quality
earphonesfirst
and
foremost
for
me
they
are
very
comfortable
plus
they
dont
fall
out
of
my
ears,
0nd
they
have
quality
sound,
0rd
the
lasting
charge
is
fantastic,
can
fall
asleep
and
there
still
playing
when
wake
hours
later:0th
with
them
being
magnetic
there
very
convenient
do
my
work,
my
housewife
things
and
workout
without
worrying
about
where
they
are
or
them
slipping
offi'm
very
satisfied
and
happy
with
these
earphonesi
highly
recommend
the
purchase
the
sound
quality
is
okay
my
issue
with
them
is
that
the
cord
is
so
stiff
that
it
really
annoying
when
it
bounces
while
running
also
have
an
issue
with
these
constantly
falling
out
of
my
ears
despite
trying
all
size
settings
that
were
included
my
previous
headphones
were
similar,
but
discontinued
so
gave
these
shot
wish
would
ve
gone
with
something
else
update:
if
you
give
these
bad
review
they
will
bombard
you
with
emails
in
an
attempt
to
pay
you
off
in
exchange
for
changing
the
review
won
accept
since
it
would
be
unethical
in
my
opinion
stand
by
my
initial
review
that
you
get
what
you
pay
for
with
this
item
have
owned
these
boltune
bluetooth
headphones
for
couple
of
months
now
and
wear
them
regularly
while
joggingthe
battery
life
is
great
have
only
charged
them
once
so
far,
and
estimate
hours
of
audiobooks
that
i've
listened
to
with
them
the
advertised
hours
of
playtime
seems
legitimatethe
earbud
does
fit
well
and
stay
in
my
ears
while
jogging,
occasionally
have
to
reset
the
earbud
in
my
ear
so
that
it
doesn't
fall
out,
but
it
is
infrequent
and
minor
adjustment
that
can
do
without
thinking
about
it
the
earbuds
are
comfortable,
at
least
for
earbudsi
am
very
happy
with
the
sound
quality
and
how
well
it
blocks
out
other
noise
exclusively
listen
to
audiobooks,
so
the
sound
quality
matters
to
me
but
not
as
much
as
it
might
matter
to
those
listening
to
music
the
noise
cancellation
is
good,
but
luckily
not
too
good
am
still
able
to
hear
enough
other
sounds
to
avoid
biker
passing
by
me
or
notice
car
approaching
at
an
intersectionwhen
storing
or
transporting
these
headphones,
the
backs
of
the
two
earbuds
are
magnetic
and
snap
together
at
first,
thought
of
this
as
minor
quality
of
life,
but
now
am
convinced
that
all
small
headphones
should
have
this
same
feature
i've
never
had
to
pull
them
out
of
bag
awkwardly
and
can
leave
them
hanging
around
my
neck
with
no
need
to
jam
them
in
pocket
or
hold
on
to
them
this
might
be
small
feature,
but
it
is
great
bought
these
for
myself
for
mother's
day
because
my
work
meetings
have
become
so
frequent
and
needed
something
that
could
listen
and
not
be
corded
to
my
laptop
so
was
free
to
fold
laundry
and
wipe
kiddos
while
muted
on
zoom
call
lol
these
come
with
various
ear
piece
sizes
so
was
able
to
customize
the
ear
piece
to
fit
me
comfortably
great
sound
and
good
noise
cancellation
for
use
in
noisy
home
but
wouldn't
be
strong
enough
cancellation
for
something
like
mowing
or
weed
eating
they
stick
out
little
far
from
my
ear
so
not
something
i'd
side
sleep
in
use
for
work
meetings
and
listening
to
music
or
podcasts
while
work
out
the
batter
life
is
great
and
they
auto
connect
to
the
various
devices
use
throughout
the
day
great
product
for
the
price
was
really,
really
confused
about
this
item;
but
the
reviews
were
good,
and
from
what
can
tell
my
pairs
were
great,
unlike
the
design
ripoff
for
the
anker
headphones
and
like
the
anker
also,
these
are
nice
colorfirst
impression:
they
are
attractive
the
bead
is
flat
instead
of
round,
and
the
buds
are
slightly
larger
on
their
ownpairing
is
as
easy
as
it
used
to
be
my
phone
noticed
them
immediately,
and
when
turned
them
on,
they
immediately
went
into
pairing
mode
anker
took
another
step
backi
listened
to
them,
both
set
to
the
same
volume
their
maximum
exchanged
ear
for
eari
tried
an
orchestra,
then
dubstep,
then
post
malone
song
with
lots
of
bass
he
won
in
all
departments
couldn't
believe
it,
so
closed
the
volume
on
these
and
went
through
more
songs
the
biggest
difference
was
that
could
hear
the
music
behind
the
main
sound
the
instruments
that
were
smuggled
with
the
anchor
were
crystal
clear
the
bass
is
ridiculous
if
like
bass
songs,
may
have
thrown
the
anchors
in
the
trash
noise
cancellation
apparently,
metal
is
plastic
beats
in
addition,
they
are
large
no
competition,
the
boltune
earbuds
won
used
to
own
pair
of
jaybird
x0
headphones,
which
loved
but
when
lost
them
didn't
want
to
spend
the
money
to
replace
them
bought
these
instead
and
was
pleasantly
surprisedsound
quality:good,
but
not
as
good
as
jaybird
x0
however,
given
the
price
difference
it's
greatearbud
tips:these
are
pretty
standard
but
they
work
the
largest
size
was
still
bit
too
small
for
me
it
still
works
but
it's
not
as
snug
as
would
likeear
wings:i
like
how
these
are
fixed
and
won't
move
around
the
jaybird
x0
had
adjustable
wings
but
found
that
that
also
meant
they
sometimes
moved
around
on
their
own
and
had
to
fix
themannoying
light:there's
light
that
blinks
every
seconds
or
so
when
it's
on
doesn't
bother
me
during
the
day
but
it's
annoying
at
night
fixed
it
by
covering
it
with
small
piece
of
tape
it
wasn't
obvious
if
there
was
way
to
disable
itgood
things
didn't
expect:
battery
life:
i've
been
using
it
off
&
on
for
days
now
and
it's
still
at
0%
magnetic
thingies:
when
they're
around
your
neck
but
not
in
your
ears
you
can
stick
them
together
with
magnets
making
it
harder
to
lose
:
these
aren't
*terrible*
headphones
by
any
stretch
of
the
imagination
if
anything,
you
do
get
lot
of
bang
for
your
buck
my
biggest
gripe
is
that
there's
soft,
staticky
buzz
present
no
matter
what's
playing
i've
tried
several
different
songs
and
even
watched
twitch
stream,
and
it's
still
therethe
battery
life
is
fine
it
does
meet
the
expected
hours
they
have
different
but
comfortable
fit,
and
can
see
myself
using
these
for
whiledon't
expect
any
serious
noise
cancellation
from
this;
it's
about
as
average
as
you're
going
to
get
with
headphones
but
nowhere
near
boselevels
of
cancellationwould
get
these
again
only
if
they
don't
break
in
the
next
days
if
something
else
unfortunate
happened,
sure
year
or
so
down
the
line
maybe
we'll
see
these
are
great
headphones,
amazing
battery
life,
and
quality
sound
the
issue
is
need
to
resync
them
with
my
iphone
each
time
want
to
use
them
meaning,
need
to
manually
forget
the
product
and
resync
them
each
time
want
to
use,
kind
of
annoying
it
seems
others
have
has
this
issue
but
can't
find
way
to
reach
the
manufacturerupdate
boltune
reached
out
to
offer
replacement
product
which
took
them
up
on
hopefully
the
issue
above
is
remedied
rating
is
updated
from
two
to
four
stars
for
this
reason
perfect
my
old
headphones
would
break
up
if
left
the
room
can
use
this
pair
while
moving
from
room
to
room
in
my
house
and
the
sound
stays
perfect
no
distortion
very
easily
connects
to
all
of
my
devices
and
the
quality
is
ahmazing
for
this
price
point
also
pop
these
in
my
ears
when
don't
want
to
be
disturbed
without
them
being
on
because
they
block
outside
sounds
wonderfully
lastly,
have
very
small
ear
canals
and
goofy
shaped
ears,
these
come
with
three
sizes
of
"puffs"
for
the
ends
and
also
three
different
sized
wedges
get
these
you
will
love
them
worked
great
for
month
little
feedback/static
but
pretty
minor,
and
since
usually
wear
only
one
ear,
it
kept
slipping
off
my
neck
because
it
doesn
have
stiff
section
at
the
back
of
the
neck
like
other
similar
headphones
have
amazing
battery
life
could
wear
for
almost
full
work
days
w/o
charging
then
out
of
nowhere
they
just
died
indicator
light
doesn
turn
on
when
plugged
in,
and
even
tried
with
different
cable,
different
outlet,
different
usb
block
won
turn
on,
won
connectessentially
just
hunk
of
useless
plastic
super
disappointing
considering
the
great
reviews
maybe
just
got
lemon
looked
at
the
reviews
for
this
earbuds
and
thought
that
it
was
good
fit
for
me
good
bass,
good
sound
quality,
no
weird
ear
loopy
thing
it's
supposed
to
keep
it
on
your
ear,
but
it
bugs
me
and
especially
the
noise
cancellation
on
top
of
that,
at
pretty
good
price
my
last
set
of
wireless
earbuds
were
the
powerbeats0,
so
was
pretty
familiar
with
the
good
sound
quality
had
been
experiencing
before
was
looking
for
replacement
because
had
accidently
put
the
powerbeats0
into
the
dryer
too
many
times
:the
packaging
that
it
came
in
was
pretty
nice,
small
box
there
were
some
earbud
fitters,
small
traveling
bag
for
the
earbuds,
and
charger
it's
fairly
easy
to
set
up
just
power
it
on,
and
connect
it
was
fully
charged
when
got
it,
so
was
able
to
experience
it
immediately
have
test
for
all
my
new
earbuds
listen
to
some
good
tunes
with
good
bass
~~
it
almost
matched
up
with
my
old
earbuds
it
was
crazy
seeing
almost
the
same
audio,
but
huge
price
difference
one
thing
to
note
is,
use
both
my
earbuds
when
listening
to
music,
because
usually
use
it
for
zoom
meetings,
or
listening
to
music
when
doing
workand,
last
but
not
least,
the
battery
life
lasted
from
am
to
0:0
pm
for
me
don't
know
if
the
battery
life
will
stay
like
this,
but
i'm
hoping
it
willcheers
battery
lasts
all
day,
charges
quickly,
and
the
magnets
actually
hold
together
really
well
the
design
of
the
soft
ear
plugs
are
the
best
i've
used
in
keeping
the
device
in
your
ear,
as
compared
to
apple
earbuds,
and
the
standard
simple
soft
plug
designnot
what
you
really
wanna
know
though
right
how
do
they
sound
superior
to
any
of
the
in
ear
audio
devices
i've
used
only
thing
that
beats
these
is
obviously
the
higher
end
over
the
ear
headphonesas
far
as
using
them
in
sports,
well,
i've
played
couple
hours
of
hockey
as
tender
in
adult
league,
acha,
and
helping
with
0u
scrimmages,
which
they
didn't
fit
as
well
as
i'd
hoped,
as
they
do
stick
out
from
the
ear
more
than
have
space
in
my
goalie
helmet,
but
were
tolerable,
and
did
well
as
far
as
sweat
goes,
as
no
one
sweats
more
than
the
goalie,
especially
when
you're
coach,
tending
net
at
0yrs
old
tending
versus
high
schoolers
and
college
kids
so
these
things
were
pretty
soaked
and
function
perfectly
after
few
months
of
useremote
is
easy
to
access,
can
just
never
remember
what
the
function
buttons
do,
as
far
as
skipping
to
volume
control
that's
one
to
many
concussions,
not
the
earbuds
faultlove
the
connection
wire
as
if
you're
taking
them
off
to
charge
you're
not
gonna
drop
one,
or
in
the
even
one
were
to
fall
out,
in
my
case
putting
the
goalie
helmet
on,
might
knock
em
out,
easy
to
retrievecons
would
be
the
aforementioned
design
sticking
out
of
the
ear
you
can't
lay
on
your
side
with
them
in,
and
snug
helmet
is
going
to
be
issue
getting
them
to
sit
right
and
comfortablyhighly
recommend
these
great
for
the
price
this
is
my
second
set
of
these
earbuds
the
only
reason
am
replacing
them
is
because
the
first
pair
fell
in
cement
and
wasn
able
to
clean
out
the
mic
well
enough
the
original
pair
still
works
great
for
audio
just
can
use
them
for
the
phone
with
the
mic
damaged
it
is
easy
to
pair
to
multiple
devices
can
be
listening
on
my
pad
and
when
phone
call
comes
in
it
it
seamlessly
switches
to
the
phone
great
feature
for
such
an
affordable
pair
of
earbuds
can
wear
them
most
of
the
day
without
discomfort
which
is
rare
for
me
the
fit
is
so
good
can
wear
them
while
using
power
tools
and
it
helps
protect
my
ears
from
the
ringing
would
normally
have
without
protection
i'd
give
this
four
stars,
but
these
are
so
big
and
heavy
that
they
fall
out
of
my
ears
and
the
cord
is
way
too
short
sound
is
pretty
decent
but
not
spectacular,
but
what
do
you
expect
for
$0
earbuds
you
can't
really
sleep
comfortably
with
these,
usually
wind
up
taking
out
the
right
earbud
as
sleep
on
my
right
side
but
they
still
fall
out,
especially
if
i'm
moving
around
these
will
fall
out
with
movement,
so
don't
recommend
these
for
physical
activity
of
any
kind
because
of
these
things,
can
only
give
three
stars
wanted
something
similar
to
my
friends
bluetooth
bose
ear
buds
with
wire
and
mic,
but
didn't
want
to
pay
the
bose
price
found
the
reviews
on
these
ear
buds
to
be
very
goodi
am
very
pleased
with
these
the
sound
quality
is
very
rich
and
full
not
all
treble
do
not
like
most
ear
buds,
hate
apple
ear
buds
they
are
so
hard
and
wont
stay
in
my
ears
have
some
dewalt
ear
buds
use
lot
but
they
are
wired
and
sound
tinny
with
mostly
treblethese
ear
buds
can
be
customized
to
fit
your
ear
with
several
sizes
of
tips
and
adaptersi
am
very
happy
with
these
if
you
are
thinking
they
may
not
be
good
because
they
are
inexpensive,
think
again
they
are
great
buy
for
under
$0
tried
three
different
bluetooth
headphones
in
week
tried
the
'ear
buds',
then
the
'neckband'
style,
and
then
finally
this
one
just
neck
chord
the
ear
buds
were
way
too
heavy
and
didn't
fit
my
ears
the
neckband
style
hung
weirdly
off
my
front,
didn't
rest
comfortably
finally,
i've
found
something
that
works
can
run
in
these
they're
little
larger
than
was
expecting,
but
they
fit
snug
and
that's
all
want
great
sound
quality
surprisingly
really
good
bass
very
happy
:
there
are
pros
and
cons
to
these
like
every
other
product
out
therepros:
they
have
great
battery
life,
use
them
for
hours
straight
and
they
keep
going
without
any
issues
the
sounds
quality
is
really
good
finding
the
fit
that
feels
the
best
is
easy
with
all
the
extra
parts
they
don't
slip
or
move
around
when
exercising
or
moving
around
lot
also
having
the
cord
helps
give
me
piece
of
mind
that
will
not
lose
them
during
my
long
ridescons:
although
this
is
my
first
pair
of
bluetooth
earbuds
i've
used
for
listening
to
music
while
cycling
expected
less
wind
interference
they
do
great
at
blocking
out
sound
when
not
moving
at
any
kind
of
speed,
but
have
to
turn
them
up
to
try
and
block
out
the
noise
from
the
wind
they
do
not
stay
paired
to
my
device,
every
time
use
them
have
to
pair
them
again
not
that
this
is
difficult
to
do,
but
it
gets
annoying
when
you
just
want
to
turn
on
and
go
the
buttons
don't
work
as
stated
can't
get
it
pause
or
switch
through
songs
use
an
app
to
listen
to
music,
but
would
still
assume
it
would
at
least
pause
the
musicall
in
all
they
are
really
good
earbuds
and
the
pros
help
outweigh
the
cons
i'm
not
sure
would
recommend
them
for
use
while
cyclingupdate:
was
able
to
get
ahold
of
the
company
and
was
able
to
figure
the
buttons
out
along
with
it
starting
synced
to
my
device
am
very
happy
with
these
headphones
have
really
small
ears
so
it
is
hard
to
find
good
headphones
that
don't
fall
out
these
have
sizes
for
the
in
ear
part
and
the
part
that
goes
inside
the
outer
ear
so
you
can
really
customize
the
fit
for
you
have
the
smallest
for
both
and
they
are
nice
and
snug
without
being
uncomfortable
my
husband
tried
them
with
the
largest
of
both
and
he
also
loves
them
so
he
is
going
to
get
pair
too
the
sound
is
really
nice
as
well
my
husband
is
lot
pickier
than
am
in
this
arena
and
he
is
happy
with
them
as
well
at
first
glance
they
seemed
quite
large
and
heavy,
but
they
are
comfy
and
stayed
in
my
ear
perfectly
fine
while
on
jog
wasn
sure
if
would
like
the
headphones
with
hooks
on
them
but
these
are
nice
they
easily
paired
with
my
iphone
and
had
no
problems
with
music
while
using
the
sound
quality
is
good
have
yet
to
discover
how
long
the
battery
life
lasts
but
hopefully
it
decent
one
thing
noticed
is
that
they
don
automatically
turn
off,
you
have
to
manually
turn
them
off/disconnect
the
bluetooth
from
your
phone
even
when
you
connect
the
ends
back
together
not
difficult
to
do
though
got
these
couple
weeks
ago
as
replacement
to
some
taotronics
blu
tooth
earbuds
had
been
using
since
was
hesitant
to
get
new
ones,
because
the
old
ones
fit
so
well
and
barely
every
slipped
out
of
my
ear
however,
after
using
faulty
charger
and
frying
them,
no
longer
had
choice,
except
to
run/workout
without
music,
and
what
kind
of
choice
is
that
reallyafter
getting
them
and
trying
them
on,
the
first
thing
noticed
was
that
these
fit
extremely
snugly
and
easily
in
my
ears
they
charged
pretty
quick,
maybe
an
hour
at
most,
and
were
very
user
friendly
as
far
as
pairing
them
with
my
galaxy
s0
simply
hold
the
middle
button
between
the
volume
adjusting
buttons
and
when
the
light
flashes
red
and
blue,
found
them
and
synced
them
to
my
phones
blu
toothi
was
waiting
to
do
proper
review
until
after
running
in
them,
which
is
the
real
test
of
blu
tooth
earbuds
after
fairly
high
intensity
run
for
around
0mins,
am
happy
to
report
that
they
didn't
fall
out
of
my
ears
single
time
or
even
feel
loose
or
on
the
verge
of
falling
out
common
problem
with
my
tao's
after
working
up
sweat
the
audio
sounds
great,
especially
after
using
an
older
pair
for
so
longall
in
all
these
are
great
headphones
for
the
price
and
the
only
complaint
have
is
that
the
max
volume
would
be
damaging
to
your
ears,
as
comfortable
level
is
around
0%0%
at
most
of
max
volume
bought
these
and
then
galaxy
buds
+
and
am
very
impressed
by
these
the
galaxy
buds
are
better
suited
for
certain
things,
but
plan
to
use
these
when
working
outside
since
can
hang
them
on
my
neck
when
not
needed
sound
quality
is
great
and
battery
life
is
ridiculously
good
and
not
one
disconnect
issues
with
my
note
have
tried
other
true
wireless
and
similar
to
these
sets
and
have
had
bad
luck
with
connection
issues
maybe
it
was
my
phone
and
an
update
fixed
the
issue
very
happy
with
these
especially
for
the
price
these
earbuds
are
worth
every
penny
very
well
built
they
feel
very
sturdy
and
premium,
and
it
seems
like
they
will
last
long
time
the
grey
color
looks
great,
and
the
battery
life
is
quite
impressive
as
advertised
have
had
them
for
almost
two
months
now
and
they
show
no
signs
of
wear
they
fit
in
my
ear
very
well,
and
have
plenty
of
tips
to
choose
from
to
customize
the
fit
to
many
different
sizes
the
sound
is
really
good,
but
not
quite
as
good
as
my
$0
wired
earbuds
that
i've
had
for
while
can
tell
that
the
wired
earbuds
have
an
ever
so
slightly
wider
range
of
sounds,
but
had
to
really
listen
to
the
earbuds
side
by
side
to
notice
the
tiny
difference
at
all
honestly
the
difference
was
so
small
that
i'm
probably
knit
picking
these
babies
are
loud
though
much
louder
than
my
wired
earbuds,
which
is
key
cause
like
to
destroy
my
eardrums
with
rock
and
roll
overall,
if
you
want
great
sound
on
budget,
you
really
cant
get
much
better
than
these
earbuds
have
small
ears
and
most
headphones
do
not
stay
in,
even
with
the
smallest
earbuds
these
stay
in
well
as
they
grip
your
inner
ear
not
the
best
sound
quality,
but
for
such
good
price
it
is
hard
to
beat
wore
them
for
about
an
hour
and
my
ears
started
to
get
little
irritated
from
the
clip
part,
but
never
really
wear
headphones
too
much
longer
than
an
hour
at
time
would
recommend
them,
just
don't
think
you
will
be
blown
away
by
some
amazing
sound
quality
for
less
than
$0
received
these
earphones
about
two
weeks
ago
and
so
far
don
really
have
complaint
they
pair
easily
with
all
my
devices,
which
has
been
problem
in
the
past
with
other
brands/models
my
favorite
spec
is
the
battery
life
most
models
ve
tried
in
the
past
would
last
few
hours
tops
out
of
the
box,
these
lasted
~0hrs,
though
may
be
off
as
it
was
difficult
to
time
it
accurately
0hrs
to
charge
fully
while
lot
of
earphones
have
these
features,
think
it
less
usual
among
models
in
the
$0
rangethe
charging
cord
is
only
few
inches
long
but
makes
sense
as
one
wouldn
likely
use
them
while
charging
and
that
saves
space
carrying
it
when
not
at
homegiven
that
they
are
waterproof
ve
worked
out
in
them
outside
the
only
downside
is
wish
there
were
some
kind
of
attachment
to
reign
in
the
flopping
wire,
though
that
problem
with
most
headphones
have
used
paperclip
on
the
back
of
my
shirt
which
seems
to
do
the
trickother
than
that,
very
happy
with
them
let
me
start
with
the
sound
quality
it
does
sound
pretty
good
second,
it
is
pretty
comfortable
in
your
ear
also
they
give
you
bunch
of
ears
buds
with
it
so
you
can
pick
and
choosei
took
one
star
because
of
the
wire
kinda
bothers
me,
since
it
is
not
sturdy
and
keeps
hanging
it
would
be
great
if
it
could
just
sit
at
place
on
your
neck
rather
than
adjusting
it
all
the
timenext,
love
the
build
quality
of
the
earplugs
and
the
magnet
kinda
helps
you
from
losing
itthey
also
give
you
cool
pouch
to
carry
itpretty
awesome
if
you
ask
me
for
the
price
point
have
now
purchased
"three"
pairs
of
these
headsets
all
amazon
verifiedamazing
quality
and
to
be
frank,
probably
just
as
good
as
the
$0+
headphonesthe
sound
quality
is
good,
and
the
plugs
are
very
comfortable,
yet
strongthe
only
thing
it's
not
good
for
is
taking
calls
in
my
experience,
the
person
on
the
other
end
of
the
call
always
claims
that
they
can
hear
my
background
noises
very
clear
and
loudso,
had
to
buy
their
noise
cancellation
pair
for
callingin
all,
boltune
now
has
had
if
not
more
purchases
from
me,
and
i'm
sure
i'll
be
back
for
more
these
headphones
are
great
got
them
for
jogging,
and
they
are
very
light
didn't
know
that
they
came
with
magnets
to
hold
around
your
neck
while
not
wearing
they
stick
into
my
ears
well
without
feeling
uncomfortable
it
came
with
many
other
plastic
ear
connectors
but
haven't
tried
them
as
the
default
fits
well
to
be
honest
just
bought
the
first
reasonable
set
that
came
up,
and
also
wasn't
aware
that
these
don't
go
around
the
top
of
the
ear
which
don't
really
care
for
this
is
better
the
default
plug
part
has
little
curve
that
fits
inside
of
the
curves
of
the
outer
ear
that
works
surprisingly
well
just
had
run
with
these
and
no
slip
ups
and
its
does
not
fall
on
your
ears
the
noise
cancellation
works
as
using
these
headphones
in
work
can
get
through
it
without
all
the
bickering
and
noise
of
the
workplace
and
focus
on
my
work
mostly
the
bass
of
the
headphones
really
fills
in
the
music
and
cancels
the
noise
of
the
outdoors
i've
been
using
these
guys
for
whole
day
and
no
issues
so
far
with
battery
just
charge
it
up
with
the
included
cable
and
readjust
with
the
included
ear
buds
and
your
good
to
go
for
the
next
day
worth
the
price
and
good
value
these
are
my
son's
favorite
type
of
earbuds
for
sleeping
with
and
really
like
boltunegood
quality
my
son
tends
to
go
through
them
at
quite
rapid
pacehe
is
autistic
and
his
temper
is
legendary
at
times
also,
he
insists
on
wearing
these
to
bed
so
he
can
listen
to
asmr
so
during
sleep
sometimes
they
get
damaged
anyway,
try
to
have
pair
on
hand
for
when
the
other
pair
breaks,
preferably
this
brand
i've
listened
to
them
as
well
and
they
have
really
good
sound
good
noise
cancellation
and
bass
especially
really
like
them
great
battery
life,
sound
quality,
and
button
controls
have
been
using
these
almost
everyday
for
the
past
couple
months
now
good
sound
quality,
volume,
and
bassi
have
smaller
ears,
so
had
to
switch
out
for
the
smaller
rubber
earbud
piece,
which
was
included
three
sizes
are
provided
also
had
to
remove
the
rubber
wing
tips
because
they
were
hurting
my
ear,
but
they
were
easily
removable
appreciate
the
different
sizes
for
customizabilitylove
the
magnetic
feature
which
keeps
them
stuck
together
when
hanging
around
my
neck
great
headphones
am
not
one
to
spend
lot
of
money
on
headphones,
as
am
notorious
for
losing,
breaking,
washing,
or
generally
being
irresponsible
with
them
have
owned
few
inexpensive
pairs
and
when
broke
my
most
recent
$0
pair,
my
husband
tried
to
talk
me
into
the
same
very
expensive
top
name
brand
pair
that
he
has
no
thanksi
purchased
this
pair
after
reading
all
of
the
reviews
and
feeling
confident
that
at
the
very
least
it
would
meet
basic
expectations
was
pleasantly
surprised
with
the
entire
package
the
headphones
look
sleek
and
perform
well
the
sound
quality
is
the
best
i've
found
in
an
inexpensive
pair
it
was
very
similar
quality
to
my
husband's
$0
pair
the
cord
that
connects
the
two
buds
is
just
the
right
length
i've
found
lot
are
too
long,
and
the
cord
gets
tangled
in
hooded
coats
and
sweatshirts
the
noise
cancellation
is
enough
to
be
effective
but
not
so
much
that
don't
know
what's
going
on
around
me
when
i'm
out
and
about
i've
had
them
for
days
now
and
haven't
had
to
charge
them
yet,
and
this
was
straight
out
of
the
box
without
charging
them
first
they
paired
seamlessly
with
my
phone
and
have
longer
reach
than
any
previous
pair
ie
can
walk
farther
away
from
my
phone
and
have
it
still
stay
connected
handy
if
i'm
cleaning
around
the
house
but
my
phone
needs
to
chargeoverall
very
happy
with
my
purchase
and
god
forbid
when
do
something
irreversible
to
this
pair,
will
order
another
this
is
my
0nd
set
of
these
earbuds
when
they
worked,
they
worked
great
but,
when
recently
bought
new
set
to
replace
set
that
failed
after
year,
they
only
worked
for
week
now
am
waiting
for
replacements
don't
understand
why
it
is
taking
so
long
was
told
would
receive
them
on
july0
now,
there
is
no
date
if
bought
them
again,
amazon
says
would
get
them
in
week
what
gives
for
warranty
claim,
would
expect
better
service
am
soooo
disappointed
this
headphones
works
like
charm
the
sound
quality
its
surprisingly
good
and
battery
life
is
very
good
also,
when
you
have
them
on
it
cancelled
outside
noises
pretty
well
work
inside
and
enclose
warehouses
and
barely
hear
the
machinery
around
me
which
is
mega
plus
for
me
since
hate
the
loud
noises
and
overall
loud
soundsthat
being
said
the
only
negative
have
of
this
product
so
far
is
that
the
mic
its
bit
lacking
in
the
fact
that
many
of
tye
people
have
conversations
with
or
exchanging
voice
clips
said
they
barely
hear
me,
tend
not
to
scream
or
talk
loudly
but
using
this
mic
forces
me
to
raise
my
voice
making
me
sound
angry
or
upset
which
is
not
the
case
but
speaking
normally
it
seems
to
not
capture
it
very
welloverall
for
the
low
price
its
being
sold
highly
recommend
them
if
your
on
budget
or
on
the
fence
of
buying
pair
at
reasonable
price
the
work
very
well,
comfortable,
with
lasting
battery
life,
good
sound
quality
for
the
price
and
the
design
its
also
good
really
like
that
you
get
sizes
of
ear
covers
and
ear
hooks
and
that
they
are
separate
you
can
use
the
small
bud
covers
and
the
medium
hooks
the
one
downside
is
the
controls
are
on
box
on
the
cord
rather
than
on
the
buds
themselves
this
means
the
controls
add
weight
to
one
side
and
tend
to
pull
on
that
side
little
did
not
rate
the
noise
cancellation
as
did
not
buy
them
for
this
feature
and
have
never
bought/wanted
noise
cancelling
headphones
so
have
no
comparison
use
these
on
mountain
bike
rides
wanted
wireless
pair
as
my
last
ear
buds
were
wired
and
the
wiring
got
ruined
during
ride
at
any
rate,
have
been
pleased
so
far
there
are
different
sets
of
fittings
to
find
the
right
size
and
fit
for
your
ears
once
got
that
dialed
in
they
are
very
comfortable
and
snug
have
ridden
on
pretty
fast
downhill
single
track
trail
and
they
stayed
put
and
sounded
great
in
spite
of
the
rough
terrain
and
wind
no
problem
with
battery
life
but
my
rides
haven't
been
super
long
haven't
tested
the
full
battery
life
yet
overall,
quality
of
the
materials
is
good
and
sound
is
decent
as
well
would
buy
again
do
like
the
magnetic
feature
as
well
so
can
take
them
off
but
keep
them
around
my
neck
while
still
active
love
these
bluetooth
headphones
use
them
for
work
around
the
house,
long
walks,
and
for
meetings
via
laptop
or
phone
the
extra
earbud
curve
took
bit
to
adjust
to,
but
the
headphones
rarely
fall
out
of
my
ears
and
after
while
don't
notice
that
they
are
there
the
quality
of
sound
is
good,
although
wind
or
poor
wifi
connection
can
affect
it,
and
when
the
battery
is
low
the
connection
wavers
noticed
that
have
to
turn
them
off
when
using
waterpik/electric
flosser
because
the
vibrations
interfere
with
the
bluetooth
connection
if
the
battery
is
low
you
have
to
wait
until
the
headphones
are
charged
again
bluetooth
doesn't
work
while
they
are
charging
like
that
there
are
different
sized
earbuds
that
come
with
the
headphones
so
you
can
adapt
to
your
comfort
level
haven't
used
them
extensively
to
listen
to
music,
but
the
sound
quality
is
good
for
talking
and
podcasts
receive
occasional
complaints
about
difficulty
hearing
my
voice
when
talking
outside
due
to
background
noise,
so
think
it
blocks
out
outside
noise
fairly
well
it's
not
soundproof
but
it
also
picks
up
background
noise
quite
bit
for
the
person
on
the
other
end
mic
vs
speaker
haven't
kept
track
of
the
battery
life,
but
use
it
for
hours
continuously
and
as
long
as
turn
it
off
and
then
back
on
as
needed
instead
of
leaving
it
on
the
whole
time
the
charge
lasts
for
several
days
also
love
having
cord
attached
to
the
earbuds
so
they
never
get
lost,
although
the
cord
could
be
little
shorter
for
me
personally
over
time,
the
battery
life
does
decrease,
but
it
is
lasts
for
at
least
four
hours
of
play
still
after
looking
at
multiple
variations
on
similar
earbuds
decided
on
these
boltune
bluetooth
headphones
have
only
had
them
few
days
but
really
like
them
so
farpros:the
sound
and
volume
are
very
good
in
my
opinion
especially
for
my
uses
at
the
gym/home
am
no
expert
but
the
bass
is
also
much
richer
than
other
bluetooth
earbuds
have
ownedthey
stay
in
my
ears
throughout
my
workout
with
the
right
size
tips
and
hooksso
far
the
battery
life
has
been
great
have
been
using
them
for
short
hour
bursts
for
the
last
three
days
and
they
still
have
~0%
charge
hopefully
this
keeps
upbluetooth
is
quick
to
pair
and
has
excellent
range
as
well
as
low
lag
when
watching
videosipx0
waterproofing
means
they
have
been
sweat
proof
have
not
tested
more
than
thatreasonably
pricedthe
earbuds
are
pretty
lightweight
even
with
the
remote
the
buttons
work
well
and
have
intuitive
controlsthe
flat
cable
is
more
durable
and
does
not
tangle
as
easily
as
standard
round
cordthe
magnet
feature
for
keeping
around
your
neck
when
not
in
use
in
nicecons:i
really
prefer
different
style
fit
than
the
silicone
tip,
it's
functional
but
not
the
most
comfortable
for
methe
earbuds
themselves
stick
out
pretty
far
from
my
earsthey
don't
seem
to
stay
connected
to
my
device
if
switch
devices
so
if
am
listening
to
the
earbuds
with
my
phone
then
want
to
switch
to
my
computer
have
to
manually
connect
them
to
the
computer,
they
will
not
connect
automaticallythey
make
lot
of
bouncing
noise
when
continuously
running
or
jumping
so
keep
that
in
mind
if
that
is
what
you
plan
on
doing
with
themthe
included
bag
only
just
fits
the
earbuds,
not
the
cable
or
additional
ear
tips
and
hooksso
in
my
view
the
pros
outweigh
the
cons
here
and
am
overall
pretty
happy
with
the
purchase
especially
considering
the
price
they
are
nice
replacement
for
my
previous
earbuds
not
from
this
company
which
finally
wore
out
these
are
the
best
headphones
that
have
found
for
working
out
and
running
the
adaptability
of
the
ear
piece
makes
this
comfortable
set
of
headphones
that
does
not
fall
out
of
your
ears
while
active
once
owning
these
will
not
go
back
to
any
other
type
of
headphones
used
to
use
the
behind
the
ear
wrap
thinking
that
was
the
key
to
keeping
the
earpieces
in
place
but
these
are
way
better
with
the
right
sizing
have
yet
to
have
these
fall
out
of
my
ears
while
running
even
once
start
sweating
customer
service
is
also
great
as
had
pair
that
failed
to
charge
after
just
under
year,
after
picture
of
the
device
not
charging
they
sent
new
ones
right
away
with
no
charge
the
sound
to
me
is
great
but
am
no
expert
on
the
subject
from
harder
rock
to
up
tempo
music
have
had
no
complaints
and
the
bluetooth
connection
is
solid
with
no
skipping
bought
second
pair
for
those
times
that
have
forgot
to
charge
them
and
need
to
get
out
the
door
for
run
at
that
instant
or
it
won't
happen
this
happened
once
and
used
my
old
headphones
and
half
way
throught
the
runn
just
took
them
off
because
was
so
annoyed
with
them
highly
recommend
these
headphones
let's
get
this
out
fronti
hate
buying
headphones
trying
to
figure
out
what
will
last,
stay
in
my
ears
when
run,
etc
is
really
pain
in
the
behind
that
being
said
really
enjoyed
these
until
my
wife's
cat
ate
them
was
worried
about
battery
life
but
can
listen
off
an
on
all
day
without
problem
they
stay
in
when
run
as
well
as
any
others
iv'e
every
had
they
also
charge
really
fast
great
if
you
do
run
out
of
battery
think
that
buying
them
again
says
it
all
really
wanted
to
love
these
headphones
the
came
beautifully
presented,
there
were
several
size
ear
buds
and
couple
sizes
of
the
piece
that
holds
it
in
your
ear,
but
no
matter
what
combination
tried,
they
wiggled
loose
during
runs
my
other
pair
of
headphones
had
the
inner
ear
piece
at
an
angle
these
are
straight,
so
maybe
that's
the
difference
but
they
always
feel
loose
and
spend
much
of
my
run
fiddling
with
my
headphones,
which
is
annoying
everyone's
ears
are
different,
so
they
might
work
great
for
you
they
just
didn't
fit
me
right
i'm
bummed
really
like
these
,
great
sound
for
the
pricevery
light
weight
so
the
easily
stay
in
your
earwhen
you
want
to
take
them
off
for
minute
and
hang
them
around
your
neck
they
magnetize
together
like
necklace
so
you
don
loose
them
which
is
awesome
my
only
complaint
is
that
have
to
forget
them
in
my
bluetooth
settings
and
re
search
as
new
device
every
time
use
them
which
takes
all
of
seconds
but
it
could
be
my
phone
not
the
head
phones
,although
don
have
any
problems
with
any
other
devices
these
headphones
are
perfect
for
running
and
working
out
have
airpods
but
they
would
always
fall
out
of
my
right
ear,
and
even
with
the
volume
turned
all
the
way
up
could
still
barely
hear
my
music
when
ran
whether
it
was
indoor
or
outdoors
don't
have
either
of
those
problems
with
these
headphones
they
stay
in
perfectly
no
matter
how
far
run
and
only
need
to
have
my
music
at
half
volume
to
be
able
to
hear
it
thanks
so
much
these
are
everything
needed
i'm
really
hard
on
headphones
and
had
been
looking
for
quality
pair
for
fair
price
so
wouldn't
have
to
baby
them
bought
these
and
had
been
enjoying
them
for
few
weeks,
when,
to
my
dismay,
accidently
lost
them
in
load
of
laundry
it
wasnt
until
after
the
cycle
was
complete
that
discovered
them
in
my
washing
machine
and
thought,
great,
there
goes
another
pair:i
pushed
the
headphones'
power
button
and,
to
my
surprise,
the
blue
light
went
on
paired
them
to
my
phone,
turned
on
some
music,
and
the
speakers
worked
called
friend
and
the
microphone
worked
astonishinly,
everything
remained
intact
and
in
perfect
working
conditionso,
from
this
experience
can
honestly
say
that
these
headphones
are
truly
quality
and
waterproof
product
these
earphones
were
great
purchased
them
in
january
0,
and
wore
them
to
bed
most
nights
to
listen
to
something
while
fell
sleep
yesterday
nov
0,
0,
the
right
side
earphone
quit
working
like
them
so
much
tho,
bought
another
set
in
the
updated
version
this
design
works
best
for
me
because
don
lose
them
in
bed,
unlike
wireless
earbuds
particularly
like
that
the
earbuds
magnetize
together,
so
they
loop
around
my
neck
when
they
re
not
in
my
ears
this
is
my
third
set
of
the
boltune
headsets
the
first
one
gave
to
my
daughter
after
using
them
for
few
months
because
she
needed
set
of
bluetooth
headsets
she
loves
them
the
second
one
misplaced
so
ordered
another
they
work
great
love
the
long
battery
life
also
the
magnet
on
the
end
of
the
ear
pieces
is
great,
as
when
have
them
around
my
neck
when
am
walking
and
not
using
them
never
have
to
worry
about
losing
them
like
the
strap
also,
just
added
security
so
don
lose
them
listen
to
books
etc
at
night
and
they
are
durable
sometimes
wake
up
with
them
still
around
my
neck
and
they
are
very
durable
highly
recommend
can
beat
the
price
these
are
my
first
bluetooth
headphones
ve
bought
and
absolutely
love
them
use
them
for
talking
in
the
phone
while
doing
other
things
and
can
multitask
without
needing
my
hands
to
hold
the
phone
the
sound
is
great
for
music
and
everyone
says
they
hear
me
very
clear
when
on
the
phone
they
re
priced
affordably
and
when
you
need
to
take
them
out
of
your
ears
for
break
you
can
still
wear
them
around
your
neck
&
they
ll
stick
together
without
falling
because
of
the
magnet
the
best
thing
about
these
earbuds
is
the
sound
quality
had
order
pair
of
headphones
from
another
seller
when
ordered
these
earbuds
and
when
they
both
came
was
surprised
to
find
out
that
my
earbuds
had
better
sound
quality
than
the
headphones
the
headphones
are
great
for
noise
canceling
wore
them
while
was
using
jack
hammer
to
redo
bathroom
and
they
worked
just
as
well
as
pair
of
ear
muffs
for
canceling
the
sound
they
are
great
pair
of
earbuds
and
have
never
regretted
buying
them
had
very
low
expectations
based
on
the
price,
but
was
extremely
surprised
how
great
these
headphones
started
out
to
be
the
packaging
was
great,
and
even
has
instructions
unheard
of
on
amazon
they
paired
up
easy
and
sounded
amazing
my
girlfriend
loved
them
also,
so
bought
another
pair
for
her
that's
when
it
all
went
bad
hers
did
not
come
with
the
spare
ear
pieces
or
instructions
no
problem,
not
really
needed
when
we
charged
it
up
and
finally
used
it
we
could
not
get
it
to
pair
with
her
phone
her
phone
kept
wanting
to
pair
with
my
set
until
turned
mine
off
what
we
learned
is
that
they
use
the
same
exact
bluetooth
address
or
whatever
it
is,
so
devices
can
not
tell
the
difference
between
the
two
headsets,
so
the
signals
cross
and
switch
back
and
forth
to
what
i'm
listening
to
and
vise
versa
so
basically
you
can
not
use
of
these
in
the
same
location
bummer
then
after
about
weeks
mine
stopped
working
all
together
bigger
bummer
i'm
sending
it
back
to
amazon
and
will
not
repurchase
i'm
glad
waited
to
write
this
review
needed
some
headphones
for
when
jog
in
the
rain
or
on
really
hot
days
when
sweat
lot
i've
been
through
multiple
pairs
of
sport
headphones
these
were
at
great
price
point
unfortunately,
these
starting
having
problems
very
early
on
while
on
long
run
the
other
day,
got
lot
of
static
in
my
right
earbudi
like
the
fit
of
the
earbuds
with
the
earbud
which
goes
into
the
canal
and
the
ear
hook
which
secures
out
in
place
use
mine
for
jogging
so
having
them
stay
in
place
without
water
getting
inside
the
ear
is
key
so
comfort
and
stability
are
greatthey
have
nice
magnetic
component
on
the
backs
which
makes
it
easy
to
wrap
around
your
neck
while
not
in
use
wish
it
came
with
clasp
on
the
cord
so
you
could
secure
the
cord
while
jogging
it
bounces
lot
in
the
front
but
less
of
problem
in
the
backcontrols
are
simple
and
easy
to
use
very
easy
set
up
charges
quicklyunfortunately,
these
were
billed
as
waterproof
and
maybe
the
static
is
from
something
else
either
way,
plan
on
returning
them
this
is
my
second
pair,
because
my
teenager
tried
mine
and
loved
them
he
uses
them
for
zoom
class
and
use
them
for
exercise
have
small
ears
son
has
large
ears
these
arrive
with
three
sizes
so
they
should
work
for
anyone
once
figured
out
how
to
twist
them
so
the
point
follows
along
my
ear,
they
don't
budge
they
sounds
good,
even
when
working
out
setup
was
breeze
charge
them
each
night
so
i'm
sure
to
have
my
tunes
for
the
next
morning's
work
outi
like
these
much
more
than
wireless
earbudsthese
allow
me
to
take
one
out
while
i'm
crossing
the
street
or
see
neighbors
can
remove
one,
let
it
hang,
and
still
say
"hi"
or
hear
oncoming
traffic
the
magnetic
clasp
allows
me
to
wear
them
around
even
when
i'm
not
using
them
genius
the
sound
quality
is
great
for
these
wireless
earbuds
these
earbuds
cancel
noise
so
well,
do
not
need
hearing
protection
while
remodeling
my
house
the
hour
battery
life
is
definitely
true
to
its
name,
while
charging
takes
any
where
from
hours
for
full
charge
if
the
battery
does
get
depleted,
voice
will
tell
you
"battery
low,"
and
you
have
about
minutes
left
until
the
battery
dies
completely
pairing
to
the
android
phone
was
easy
and
took
about
minute
to
complete
the
different
sized
ear
buds
and
mesh
pouch
are
nice
touch
to
this
already
great
wireless
earbud
design
have
already
bought
second
pair
thought
these
were
going
to
be
loss
after
months
they
quit
working
on
me
rated
them
very
lowly

badafter
speaking
with

they

they
were
very
adamant
about
me
having

no
doubt,
will
be
purchasing
the
newer
wireless
ones
after
this
experience
buy
bought
these
my
wife
for
walking,
and
we
liked
them

much
that

my
jabra

are
my
current
0star
benchmark
for
music
and
sound
quality
these
headphones
sound
great
and
the
battery
lasts
long
time
had
an
issue
with
defective
pair
and
customer
service
was
very
helpful
in
dealing
with
replacing
them
at
no
additional
cost
jacky
from
their
customer
service
told
me:
"we
are
committed
to
providing
you
quality
products
and
topnotch
customer
service
and
hope
to
serve
you
for
years
to
come"
and
can
definitely
say
they've
followed
through
on
that
promise
highly
recommend
these
headphones
so
far
i'm
enjoying
the
headphones
it's
very
nice
product
for
the
price
i've
gone
through
three
or
four
headphones
ranging
from
$0
to
$0
and
have
returned
them
all
for
one
thing
or
another
was
especially
disappointed
with
the
$0
set;
really
haven't
been
able
to
tell
the
difference
in
quality
between
the
expensive
and
less
expensive
products
so
far,
this
product
has
great
sound,
people
tell
me
the
mic
sounds
great,
and
they
have
great
fit
to
my
ear
things
found
lacking
with
previous
products
i've
been
looking
for
pair
like
this,
but
with
hard
case
to
hang
around
my
neck;
think
still
like
the
hard
case
better,
but
just
the
wire
doesn't
bother
me
as
much
as
thought
really
like
this
headset
it
is
comfortable
and
has
great
battery
life
didn't
have
to
charge
the
headset
for
few
days
it
connects
easily
really
like
the
magnet
feature
it
is
great
to
just
hook
the
magnets
together
and
not
lose
the
headset
can
also
comfortably
leave
one
earbud
in
and
connect
the
magnet
up
to
it
when
need
to
be
alert
and
hear
with
the
other
ear
the
sound
quality
is
bar
far
better
than
other
headsets
i've
tried
and
the
noise
canceling
feature
is
awesome
as
well
received
this
product
as
gift
for
christmas
and
am
very
happy
don't
expect
enthusiast
audio
quality
at
this
price
point
it
does
the
job
the
magnetic
tips
on
the
earbuds
are
nice
for
keeping
them
around
your
neck
when
not
in
use
they
fit
nicely
in
my
earsmy
biggest
complaint
is
that
the
unit
will
disconnect
and
reconnect
randomly
when
in
midconversation,
which
has
happened
several
times
already,
and
this
is
very
frustrating
aside
from
that,
it
would
be
or
starsedit:
simply
had
too
many
issues
with
this
headset
where
it
was
constantly
disconnecting
and
reconnecting
which
made
them
unusable
dropping
to
one
star
am
extremely
picky
about
my
headphones
and
hate
spending
money,
had
my
last
set
of
boltune
bluetooth
headphones
for
years
so
naturally
when
needed
new
ones
went
for
these
and
am
not
disappointed
this
model
is
even
better
than
the
last
pair
had
sound
quality
is
spectacular,
they
fit
in
my
ears
and
stay
there,
and
the
battery
lasts
forever
find
the
magnetic
buds
to
be
so
helpful,
when
am
not
using
them
but
will
be
soon
just
wrap
them
around
my
neck
and
they
clink
together,
dont
have
to
worry
about
misplacing
them
or
tangled
wires
whenever
need
headphones
again
will
definitely
get
boltunes
i've
only
had
these
few
day
but
so
far
love
them
use
them
for
conference
calls
and
to
listen
to
musicthey
stay
put
in
my
earsthey
are
easy
to
pairthe
control
buttons
are
easy
to
use
by
feel,
up/down
volume,
mute/hangupthey
cancel
noise
so
well
that
when
need
to
hear
what's
going
on
around
me
while
on
call
or
listening
to
music,
can
easily
use
earpiece
and
leave
one
out
without
it
pulling
out
the
one
i'm
usingi
gave
start
on
the
battery
but
i've
only
used
them
short
time
but
so
far
the
battery
is
great
bought
this
for
my
teenager
boy
and
he
is
in
love
with
he
wants
to
buy
another
pair
for
his
school
gym
lockerit
comes
with
extra
set
of
ear
buds
with
different
sizes,
charging
port
and
small
mesh
bag
for
the
storage
packaging
is
very
sleekit
does
what
it
advertised
to
every
single
detail
and
love
the
design
with
magnet
so
it
wont
wobble
around
while
around
the
neckits
range
is
incredible
and
it
works
more
than
hrs
with
all
these
features
can
beat
the
pricestrongly
recommend
for
under
$0,
these
are
great
buy
if
noise
cancelling
is
high
priority
for
you,
these
headphones
are
extremely
effective
they
pair
easily
and
stay
put
while
wearing
can
use
these
while
jogging
and
trust
that
they
won't
fall
outfour
stars
because:0
they
cannot
be
used
while
charging
this
would
be
very
useful
feature
for
me
since
often
use
them
while
working
at
desk,
and
it
would
be
convenient
to
charge
and
use
them
simultaneously0
sound
quality
is
good,
not
great
i'd
put
it
on
par
with
other
headphones
in
the
same
price
range
if
you're
looking
for
bose
or
sennheiser
quality,
spend
the
extra
cash
but
if
these
are
just
casual
listening
headphones
for
you,
the
quality
is
perfectly
acceptable
the
seller
offers
dollar
gift
card
if
you
leave
review
think
that
is
the
reason
it
has
so
many
bribing
gift
card
aside,
do
think
the
earphones
are
good
for
the
price
and
would
buy
them
again
because
of
its
value
and
quality,
but
its
worth
reading
carefully
the
other
customers
reviews
to
see
if
they
are
the
right
fit
for
you
the
gray
color
is
tad
darker
than
showed
the
magnet
between
earplugs
is
strong
and
the
sound
is
clear
im
thinking
about
buying
another
set
initially
was
bit
hesitant
to
buy
these
bluetooth
headphones,
since
an
expensive
pair
of
backbeats
bit
the
dust
after
year
so
how
good
could
an
less
expensive
pair
be
but,
the
reviews
were
good,
so
took
the
leapthe
sound
quality
is
amazing
as
an
audio
engineer
and
audiophile,
am
quite
picky,
and
these
headphones
deliver
crisp
full
range
audio
and
the
price
can't
be
beat
at
the
price
could
have
pairs,
one
to
use
while
the
other
one
needs
charge
and
still
be
cheaper
than
the
backbeatsthe
only
minor
mention
is
the
cord
between
the
earbuds
could
be
little
longer
overall:
these
arrived
the
next
day
they
are
very
high

the

tried

the
next

and

was
straightforward
one
minor
issue
is
the
instruction

the

they

it
again
with

the

it

to

when

value
over

original
review:purchased
in
late
april,
stopped
pairing
in
midoctober
excellent
sound
and
mic
quality
for
the
price,
but
they
are
useless
if
can't
pair
with/
phoneupdate:the
manufacturer
reached
out
to
me
and
sent
replacement
headset
as
stated
earlier,
the
headset
performance
is
excellent
value
for
the
price
combine
that
with
commitment
to
customer
satisfaction
and
this
becomes
nobrainer
purchase
these
earbuds
are
very
customizable
they
have
three
different
size
attachments
to
fit
in
your
ear
canal,
and
they
also
have
adjustable
outer
ear
hooks
that
sit
just
above
the
ear
canal
this
allows
them
to
stay
tight
in
your
ears
even
during
vigorous
activities
such
as
running
they
also
have
magnetic
clasp
which
allows
them
to
close
securely
around
your
neck
when
not
in
use
the
sound
is
particularly
rich
base,
which
makes
them
great
for
listening
to
hip
hop
especially
they
are
definitely
good
for
activity
all
around
i've
been
on
the
hunt
for
pair
of
headphones
that
can
get
me
through
full
workday
for
about
years
i've
tried
altek,
anker,
jbuds
and
various
offbrands
for
decent
pair
of
bluetooth
headphones
that
don't
require
recharge
during
the
day
i've
found
these
to
be
remarkable
fair
sound
quality,
seamless
connectivity,
best
noise
canceling
i've
tried
although
don't
use
it
but
they
have
shockingly
good
battery
life
i'm
picky
about
the
comfort
of
headphones
and
cannot
tolerate
hard
earbuds
and
these
are
great
after
hours
of
use
the
cord
is
comfortable
and
doesn't
get
tangled
in
my
hair
will
say
the
play/forward/back
buttons
are
little
stiff
but
that
doesn't
impact
how
much
will
use
these
i'm
tempted
to
buy
second
pair
to
keep
with
my
workout
gear
as
keep
these
with
my
computer
am
receiving
$0
dollar
gift
card
for
this
review
but
this
is
an
honest
reviewthe
sound
quality
is
great
the
bass
is
noticeable
and
the
voice
is
clear
and
loud
they
come
with
multiple
ear
pieces
so
finding
the
one
that
fits
your
ear
comfortably
is
easy
it
also
has
little
bag
to
store
it
in
only
downfall
if
you
want
to
consider
it
to
be
trully
downfall
is
the
charger
that
it
comes
with
is
short
but
you
wont
be
using
them
while
they
charge
so
like
said
no
big
deal
they
charge
fast
and
last
long
timereally
recommended
product
if
you
dont
want
to
break
the
bank
with
name
brand
use
them
for
exercise
so
they
are
going
to
get
sweat
and
dirt
from
hiking
and
what
not
so
it
fits
my
need
update:company
reached
out
to
me
and
provided
exceptional
customer
service
they
definitely
take
care
of
their
customerspurchased
couple
of
these
units
worked
great
for
about
months;
great
sound
and
call
quality
however,
now
both
are
useless
it
is
small
miracle
to
get
them
to
charge,
little
more
of
miracle
to
get
them
to
turn
on,
and
fullon
miracle
to
get
them
to
connect
when
can
get
them
to
charge,
turn
on,
and
actually
connect,
get
lot
of
static
if
it
was
one
unit,
would
chalk
it
up
to
something
with
that
specific
set
but
since
it
has
affected
both
units
at
the
same
time,
it
has
to
be
the
design
and
construction
know
they
are
not
very
expensive
but
try
another
manufacturer
have
bought
many
pairs
of
bluetooth
headphones
including
pair
of
bose
headphones
for
the
most
part
these
have
be
listen
to
music
in
the
morning
while
am
getting
breakfast
ready,
often
forget
to
tun
them
off
for
several
hours,
but
there
is
always
plenty
of
battery
to
get
through
the
day
do
wish
it
had
separate
buttons
for
volume
and
skip
listen
to
books
and
often
loose
my
place
so
have
to
take
out
my
phone
to
go
back
the
one
thing
liked
about
the
bose
was
the
clip
that
hooked
to
your
shirt
that
kept
them
in
place
because
work
in
kitchen
usually
only
have
one
headphone
in
so
ordered
some
headphone
clips
and
use
them
with
these
headphones
would
highly
recommend
buying
these
use
my
earbuds
mostly
for
watching
tv
or
listening
to
music
so
as
not
to
disturb
my
husband
sleeping
have
gone
through
lot
have
bad
habit
of
falling
asleep
while
watching
television
at
night
and
that
leads
to
my
ear
buds
battery
depleting
more
often
than
care
the
biggest
thing
love
about
these
ear
buds
is
that
they
automatically
shut
off
after
certain
amount
of
inactivity
while
using
watching
television
via
my
firestick
so,
get
more
use
between
charges
have
noticed
that
it
does
not
do
that
while
listening
to
music
via
my
phone,
but
usually
remember
to
turn
them
off
when
am
done
anyway
have
to
say,
overall
these
are
great
and
have
long
battery
life
loved
them
so
much,
came
back
and
bought
two
more
pairs
what
great
product
for
the
amount
of
money
spent
needed
wireless
pair
of
earbuds
for
exercising
but
was
afraid
to
go
with
true
wireless
since
bud
often
time
have
hard
time
staying
in
my
ears
after
researching
the
multitude
of
budget
bluetooth
buds
on
the
market
finally
pulled
the
trigger
on
the
boltune
set
am
very
happy
about
my
decisionwhen
am
in
an
environment
where
need
little
more
awareness
can
just
remove
one
bud
and
tuck
it
in
my
collar
if
the
situation
changes
can
just
pop
the
other
bud
in
right
away
also
love
the
magnetic
connector
for
storagei
gave
the
noise
cancellation
only
stars
because
getting
true
tight
fit
in
my
ears
was
difficult
to
completely
block
out
ambient
noise
it
may
just
be
my
ears
however,
more
than
good
enough
for
the
money
had
to
paid
when
they
asked
me
to
write
an
honest
review
thought
okay,
gonna
be
totally
honest
thoughthey
arrived
on
april
have
had
them
little
over
monththis
is
about
the
0th
pair
of
bluetooth
headphones/ear
buds
have
bought
on
amazon
why
so
many
well
buy
em
cheap
because
misplace
then
sleep
in
them
every
night
bike
and
walk
in
themi
try
to
stay
around
bucks
this
is
the
first
time
ve
bought
this
brand
bought
them
for
the
battery
life
and
the
reviews
are
solidhere
the
good
news
this
is
the
best
pair
of
ear
buds
ve
ever
bought
on
amazon
they
sound
good
similar
time
other
brands
bought
here
like
the
look
and
feel
and
yes
the
batter
life
is
outstanding
sleep
in
them,
wake
up
and
have
coffee
and
then
go
for
an
hour
of
exercise
no
issuesi
an
ordering
another
pair
these
are
legit
have
tried
almost
every
set
of
wireless
headphones
can
find
wear
them
pretty
much
all
day
every
day
as
running
power
tools
battery
life
is
solid
hours
they
fit
in
my
ears
better
than
the
high
baller
bose
or
sony
ones
and
they
are
reasonably
priced
usually
get
about
year
to
year
and
half
out
of
them
before
they
get
crunched
by
something
heavy
they
are
the
best
ones
ve
found
very
good
sound
for
the
price
volume
goes
much
higher
than
the
previous
pair
replaced
with
these
listen
just
about
all
day
on
the
road
and
working
outside
and
they
sound
really
goodfit
is
fine
the
magnets
could
perhaps
hold
together
little
more
tightly
but
they
work
well
enough
to
mostly
stay
put
when
not
in
use
the
larger
ear
pieces
can
wiggle
loose
from
my
ears
from
time
to
time
but
by
and
large
they
stay
in
place
even
when
am
activethe
real
selling
point
is
the
sound
quality;
given
the
sale
price
put
them
under
$0
when
picked
them
up
am
really
pleased
with
them
after
owning
these
for
while,
can
confidently
say
that
these
headphones
are
great
the
sound
is
clear
and
balanced,
the
battery
life
is
pretty
good
turn
them
off
when
not
in
use
and
that
helps
with
the
battery
as
well
like
how
compact
the
headphones
are
and
that
can
wear
them
around
my
neck
without
needing
to
put
them
in
case
or
hold
them
in
my
hand
the
only
addition
that
would
like
to
have
would
be
some
kind
of
clip
to
attach
to
my
clothing
when
am
using
only
one
earpiece,
particularly
when
driving
and
talking
on
the
phone
all
in
all,
would
highly
recommend
these
headphones
to
anyone
love
this
style
of
bt,
they
seem
to
hold
so
much
more
battery
power,
and
you
can
disconnect
them
easily
around
your
neck,
and
they
magnet
together
so
you
don't
have
to
pocket
them
or
worry
so
much
about
them
getting
lost
and
the
cost
is
super
reasonable
for
what
you
get
had
previous
pair
similar
to
these,
and
the
'wings'
on
the
earbuds
make
them
stay
in
more
securely
when
exercising
thumbs
up
was
looking
for
something
for
my
home
office
that
could
take
around
with
my
phone
as
well
these
came
across
as
well
reviewed,
and
can
see
why
they
are
by
far
the
most
comfortable
earphones
i've
worn;
that
was
important
because
i'd
wear
them
for
extended
periods
the
sound
quality
is
awesome,
it's
actually
better
than
the
earcovering
headphones
used
to
wear
the
pairing
experience
with
my
laptop
and
phone
was
seamless;
there
was
hardly
any
setup
requiredif
you're
looking
for
something
inexpensive,
i'd
highly
recommend
these
love
the
sound
on
these
new
boltune
bluetooth
earphones
had
two
issues
of
which
one
is
resolved
but
for
the
other,
no
solution0
the
earphones
did
not
auto
connect
to
my
iphone
no
matter
how
many
times
tried
every
time
turned
them
on,
it
didn
connect
and
asked
me
to
click
forget
this
device
did
that
and
switched
bluetooth
off
and
on
on
my
phone
and
connected
it
again
as
fresh
connection
it
kept
bothering
me
so
had
chat
with
amazon
support
before
thinking
of
returning
it
they
helped
me
reset
the
earphone
by
pressing
the
on
button
for
seconds
and
restarted
the
phone
it
works
fine
now0
the
other
more
pressing
issue
is
the
wings
provided
with
the
earphone
hurt
my
ears
they
are
too
pointed
and
if
use
smaller
set,
it
keeps
falling
off
my
earsi
think
ll
try
and
use
it
couple
of
days
more
and
see
if
they
stop
hurting
else
ll
have
to
return
themon
the
bright
side,
love
the
sound
quality
and
the
fact
the
people
on
the
other
side
of
the
phone
can
hear
me
properly
these
are
great
feel
like
have
small
ears,
and
the
interchangeable
pieces
made
it
easy
to
make
them
fit
my
ears
perfect
the
sound
is
awesome,
and
the
battery
life
is
amazing
they
also
come
with
mesh
carry
case,
which
is
handy
the
magnetic
piece
to
join
them
together
if
they
are
not
in
your
ears
is
great
addition
also
would
definitely
recommend,
and
would
definitely
purchase
again
if
something
happened
to
mine
purchased
these
to
replace
another
set
that
had
absolutely
horrible
sound
quality
these
definitely
fixed
that
issue
they
sound
great
they
are
also
relatively
comfortable
for
ear
buds
they
stay
in
place
well
can't
really
comment
on
battery
life
yet,
but
hours
didn't
really
make
dent
in
the
indication
on
my
phone
let's
hope
they
hold
up
i've
been
getting
months
out
of
bt
ear
buds,
then
one
of
the
speakers
fails
or
something
i'm
hoping
for
more
for
the
extra
few
bucks
spent
on
these
they
look
little
higher
quality
than
others
have
had
this
is
my
second
boltune
headphones
use
them
for
walking
and
to
watch
tv
the
sound
is
clear
and
sharp
the
battery
lasts
about
hours
what
like
to
hear
is
when
they
are
turned
on
to
tell
the
battery
level,
full,
medium
or
low
it
only
staes
battery
low
about
twice
and
then
turns
off
it
does
not
let
fall
sleep
with
them
because
the
earbuds
stick
out
of
the
ear
canal
too
long
would
buy
another
pair
so
far
they
definitely
last
as
long
as
stated
and
they
sound
greatthe
noise
canceling
is
real
can
hear
anything
that
is
reasonably
audible
while
have
them
turned
on
much
less
while
the
music
is
playingif
had
complaint,
it
would
be
the
spongey
ear
pieces
the
rubber
is
thin
so
they
wiggle
out
of
my
ears
on
occasion
it
not
enough
of
an
inconvenience
to
be
dealbreaker
only
need
pair
now
to
get
me
through
work
days
dope
got
them
just
today,
i'm
very
amazed
by
the
sound
quality
of
the
earbuds
they
came
in
nice
packaging,
the
earbuds
themselves
are
magnetic
like
you
would
see
in
other
brands
like
beats
etc,
and
since
had
the
boltune
tws
earbuds
for
small
period
before
returning
them
due
to
not
so
great
battery
life,
knew
for
fact
that
these
had
to
sound
just
as
good
as
those
had,
no
doubt
i'm
very
happy
with
the
way
they
sound,
the
bass
is
great
and
the
mids
and
lows
are
noice
as
well,
they're
just
awesome
lol
i'm
definitely
going
to
buy
from
this
company
in
the
future,
recommend
them
to
everybody
for
$0
they
are
steal
:
this
is
my
third
pair
of
headphones
from
boltune
still
have
my
first
which
loved
&
still
have
wanted
newer
pair,
so
bought
newer
version
after
few
months
lost
them
second
pair
luckily
still
have
the
first
pair
that
work
perfectly
as
back
up
just
got
my
new
ones
and
love
them
just
as
much
love
how
lightweight
and
comfortable
they
are
the
volume
&
noise
cancellation
is
great
use
them
mostly
for
working
out
&
running
have
no
problems
with
them
falling
out
while
running
no
problems
pairing
also
no
problems
taking
calls
on
them
as
well
have
pair
of
beats
by
dre
and
definitely
think
the
sound
is
clearer
and
much
louder
on
my
boltunes
oh,
and
did
mention
the
price
point
have
ran
threw
lot
of
headphones
over
the
years
and
these
are
the
best
quality
&
sound
for
the
price
that
you
will
find
these
are
probably
the
most
frustrating
bluetooth
headphones
ve
ever
purchased
every
time
use
them
connection
unsuccessful
appears
and
have
to
forget
device
exit
out
of
settings
and
then
go
back
into
bluetooth
and
add
them
as
if
never
used
them
before
this
happens
with
every
use
also
these
headphones
randomly
turn
off
without
any
notice
and
the
battery
isn
even
low
then
have
to
go
through
he
whole
process
of
adding
them
again
really
way
more
trouble
than
they
re
worth
wanted
to
go
cordless
when
using
my
phone
or
computer,
and
still
be
able
to
have
stereo
sound
for
music
these
do
pretty
good
job
there
are
several
different
sizes
of
ear
buds,
and
it
has
very
good
battery
lifei
wish
the
cord
between
the
earphones
was
little
longer
inches
would
work
it's
kind
of
hard
to
get
to
the
buttons
on
the
microphone
as
it
is
now
have
small
ears
and
have
hard
time
finding
headphones
that
fit
my
wired
headphones
finally
broke
had
gotten
annoyed
at
the
wires
always
tangling
when
jogged,
so
thought
i'd
try
out
wireless
pairthese
exceeded
my
expectations
they
fit
comfortably
and
the
soft
little
hook
that
fits
into
the
ear
keeps
them
from
falling
when
jogging,
running,
etc
wore
them
for
several
hours
with
no
soreness
in
my
earthe
sound
is
great
and
love
that
you
can
accept
phone
calls
and
chat
toomy
husband
was
so
impressed
by
them,
he
asked
for
pair
for
father's
day
highly
recommend
here
is
my
honest
review
bought
this
sometime
late
february
lasted
for
months
until
the
right
ear
piece
broke
off
still
continued
to
use
this
by
doing
quick
fix
using
an
elastic
bandsuper
glue
would
work
too
but
was
unable
to
go
out
due
to
covid
because
really
liked
the
quality
of
the
sound
though
it
broke
did
not
write
the
review
because
really
liked
the
quality
of
the
sound
however
week
later
the
earphones
went
dead
it
connects
to
the
phone
via
bluetooth
but
does
not
pick
up
any
sound
hence
decided
to
write
this
review
well
guess
this
is
the
max
lifetime
for
bluetooth
earphones
of
this
price
one
could
only
expect
so
much
for
this
price
am
disappointed
though
because
liked
the
quality
of
sound
while
it
lastedplease
do
focus
on
improving
the
quality
would
rather
have
earphones
that
last
longer
than
$0
gift
cardfor
those
looking
for
an
earphones
that
last
long
then
this
might
not
be
for
you
if
you
are
ok
with
constantly
replacing
the
earphones
it's
good
fair
price
the
first
time
used
this
product
it
was
ok
compared
to
other
brands
i've
used,
the
sound
quality
was
fair
as
far
as
could
tell
unfortunately
only
was
able
to
use
it
total
of
two
times,
and
now
it
won't
turn
on
at
first
thought
the
battery
was
just
dead,
but
tried
charging
it
multiple
times
overnight
and
could
never
get
it
to
turn
on
would
even
plug
it
into
the
charger,
and
the
red
indicator
light
would
come
on,
but
then
when
tried
to
turn
it
on
nothing
would
happen
i'm
reaching
out
to
the
manufacturer
to
get
replacement
and
will
update
this
if
so**update:
the
seller
did
send
me
replacement
pair
of
headphones
have
been
using
them
for
the
past
couple
of
week
and
they
have
been
working
without
any
issues
appreciate
the
prompt
and
helpful
customer
service,
and
the
headphones
themselves
have
been
living
up
to
expectations
great
bluetooth
earphones
and
mic
for
running,
sports
in
general
i'm
jogger
and
have
just
bought
these
to
get
that
music
and
legs
running
together
they
do
great
job
at
staying
in
my
ears
and
providing
hours
of
service
gives
the
impression
that
your
immersed
in
the
music
while
i'm
running,
that's
must
so
that
get
that
feeling
that
allows
me
to
push
further
more
to
get
great
performances
do
recommend
this
product
comes
with
all
accessories
needed
and
is
water
and
sweat
resistant
too
got
this
headphones
for
my
0yo
mom
she
loves
them,
they
stay
on
her
ear
and
the
magnetic
end
help
to
prevent
loss
she
won
forget
them
around
her
neck,
or
she
might
but
she
won
actually
lose
them
sound
quality
is
excellent
and
they
fill
her
need
perfectgood
quality
product,
pairing
was
easy
and
flawless
with
samsun
galaxy
tabletmy
mom
is
very
happy
with
her
new
headphones
as
with
all
bluetooth
headphones
just
don't
use
them
often
and
when
do
want
to
use
them
they
are
never
charged
been
leaving
them
plugged
in
but
don't
know
if
that's
good
idea
or
not
when
charged
they
do
last
long
time
but
if
you
leave
them
laying
around
couple
of
days
they
seem
to
lose
the
charge
maybe
that's
typical
of
this
type
earbud,
idk
but
like
them
ok
theses
were
great
while
they
lasted
got
about
four
months
out
of
them
and
then
they
decided
to
die
there
was
some
popping
and
buzzing
that
figured
was
just
some
interference
after
that
they
just
quit
working
to
bad,
really
liked
them
they
had
amazing
range
for
bluetooth,
well
over
feetupdate:
the
seller
reached
out
to
me
and
helped
to
correct
my
problem
stand
by
the
positive
things
in
my
review
these
buds,
for
the
price,
sound
good,
have
great
range,
and
have
amazing
battery
life
have
had
cheap
headphones,
expensive
headphones,
and
everything
in
between
for
the
price,
these
are
definitely
the
best
in
this
day
of
mask
wearing,
it's
good
to
have
headphones
that
don't
hook
over
the
ear,
competing
with
the
mask
ties
the
battery
life
is
grand
the
antenna
range
is
better
than
any
bluetooth
headphones
i've
had
the
sound
quality
is
pretty
good
and
the
price
is
just
terrific
best
wireless
earphones
have
owned
what
like:
long
battery
life,
secure
magnetic
join
when
earphones
are
around
my
neck
so
don
lose
them,
comfortable
fit
in
ear
three
sizes
of
ear
pieces,
great
noise
cancellation
need
to
remove
from
ear
to
hear
regular
noise
levels,
water
tight
cover
to
recharging
port
so
can
walk
in
the
rain
without
worrying
love
these
earphones
great
shopping
experience
received
as
promised
charged
quickly
and
was
able
to
use
right
away
when
asked
if
my
caller
could
hear
me
with
any
interference,
they
remarked
that
it
was
crystal
clear
even
when
whispered,
they
could
hear
me
just
fine
synced
easily
to
my
computer
and
phone
had
many
ear
pieces
to
switch
out
to
fit
me
comfortably
would
definitely
recommend
this
product
to
others
used
these
headphones
right
out
of
the
box
without
charging
them
easy
to
pair
to
my
phone
the
sound
was
great
the
bass
was
just
right
for
me
as
well
was
able
to
use
them
for
over
hours
before
charged
them
for
the
first
time
they
charged
really
fast
as
well
would
definitely
buy
these
againupdate:
recently
took
these
headphones
with
me
on
hour
ride
on
our
side
by
side
they
definitely
helped
to
drown
out
the
high
pitched
deafening
noise
those
machines
make
the
battery
lasted
the
entire
hour
journey
and
hadn't
charged
them
for
at
least
day
or
two
they
were
tad
uncomfortable
with
my
helmet
on
but
they
aren't
made
specifically
for
helmet
i'm
definitely
glad
purchased
these
headphones
update:
these
headphones
only
work
when
listening
when
talking,
no
one
can
ever
hear
me,
and
have
to
hold
the
mouthpiece
in
front
of
my
face,
and
even
then
people
say
that
sound
muffled
or
distorted
this
defeats
the
purpose
of
hands
free
bluetooth
headphones,
so
am
now
rating
them
stars
battery
life
is
still
great
and
sound
quality
for
listening
to
music
and
videos
is
goodthese
are
great
replaced
my
qfit
bt
headphones
because
my
son
pulled
the
housing
apart
so
far,
these
are
much
higher
quality
comfortable
to
wear,
inconspicuous
great
for
keeping
little
babies
away,
the
sound
quality
is
great,
and
the
battery
life
has
been
good
and
the
buying,
warranty,
and
customer
service
experience
has
been
great
happy
customer
this
review
is
for
btbh0
pro
which
is
the
upgrade
to
the
btbh0
my
first
review
regarding
the
original
earbuds
was
stars
the
company
sent
me
complimentary
upgraded
version
and
what
difference
the
sound
quality
is
excellent
and
the
wing
style
eartips
are
very
comfortable
still
wish
they
didn't
stick
so
far
out
of
your
ears
but
that's
not
deal
breaker
for
me
would
definitely
purchase
this
item
stars
purchased
my
boltune
btbh0
in
february
and
could
not
be
more
pleased
have
used
bluetooth
earbuds
from
many
years
and
have
tried
several
brands
and
styles
the
boltune
are
by
far
the
best
fitting,
most
comfortable,
and
greatest
sounding
of
any
in
fact,
just
bought
two
more
to
share
with
my
family
particularly
like
the
earbud
options
and
the
sound
isolation
provided
they
are
truly
amazing
for
the
price
you
pay
okay
am
on
my
second
set
the
first
pair
worked
well
but
stopped
charging
fully
and
then
it
was
struggle
ordered
replacement
and
these
work
well
at
this
time
too
but
honestly
the
time
it
takes
to
charge
then
fully
is
about
hrs
the
light
turns
red
while
charging
but
then
goes
off
and
when
fully
charged
switches
to
blue
so
if
you
are
having
trouble
with
the
charging
time
hope
this
helps
and
if
yours
charge
faster
then
have
yet
another
defective
set
pros
looks
nice,
good
battery
life,
good
sound
volume
control
on
wireexcellent
customer
serviceconssticks
out
of
my
ear
to
far
even
with
using
the
smallest
adapter
for
inside
ear
was
still
uncomfortable
im
normsl
size
male
with
normal
size
ears
too
tight
for
me
plus
they
will
not
work
under
hearing
protection
muffs
because
of
the
stick
out
got
them
primarily
to
listen
to
music
while
mowing
lawns
sound
quality
is
clear
and
crisp
listen
to
audio
books
without
any
strange
or
high
pitched
noises
the
battery
life
so
far
is
great
pairing
is
easy
and
on/off
functions
are
also
very
easy
my
only
complaint
is
that
they
stick
out
little
farther
then
expected,
specifically
an
issue
when
wear
stocking
cap
it
is
winter
in
the
midwest
and
that
tends
to
push
the
earbuds
into
my
ear
and
can
be
little
bit
uncomfortable
think
i'll
get
used
to
it,
but
it
was
something
that
bothered
me
just
little
when
first
got
them
overall
i'm
happy
with
the
purchase
have
tried
number
of
bluetooth
ear
buds
and
these
are
by
far
the
best
the
battery
life
has
always
been
an
issue,
with
other
sets
promising
battery
life
that
they
didnt
come
close
to,
but
these
are
amazing
listended
to
them
solid
for
days
and
still
had
juice
left
the
signal
is
strong,
you
can
leave
your
phone
on
the
other
side
of
multiple
rooms
and
barely
any
difference
in
connection
they
sound
great
and
the
feel
good
in
the
ears
they
come
with
number
of
differing
ear
components
to
customize,
but
the
ones
that
come
on
them
feel
perfect
so
haven't
even
had
to
use
them
if
had
to
nitpick,
they
feel
bit
heavy
in
the
ears,
but
think
that
is
just
me
not
being
used
to
solidly
built
ear
buds
they
dont
move
and
feel
fine,
so
really
not
complaint
overall,
these
are
perfect
also
ordered
pair
for
my
daughter,
im
sure
she
will
love
them
usually
opt
for
aroundtheear
sport
headphones
since
most
earbuds
fall
out
of
my
ears
pretty
quickly
must
have
oddly
shaped
ears,
don
know
at
any
rate,
since
these
have
little
clip
to
keep
them
in
place
and
lot
of
good
reviews
indicate
that
they
don
fall
out,
decided
to
give
them
try
didn
have
any
problems
pairing
them
to
my
iphone
or
anything
like
that
but
when
went
for
run
only
made
it
feet
before
they
bounced
out
this
was
using
the
largest
of
the
silicon
tips
and
clips
that
were
provided
sending
them
back
since
there
isn
any
point
in
making
these
work
for
me
wish
could
leave
review
on
the
sound
quality,
battery
life,
and
other
important
factors,
but
used
them
for
seconds
before
they
fell
out
realize
that
many
inear
headphones
don
work
for
me,
but
was
hoping
these
would
be
different
unfortunately,
they
were
not
cannot
tell
any
difference
between
any
of
these
except
for
the
vast
difference
in
prices
these
earbuds
fit
just
fine,
and
sound
just
as
good
as
the
"designer"
earbuds
why
would
you
want
to
fork
out
at
least
$0
more
for
other
earbuds
that
are
no
better
than
these
they
do
exactly
what
was
hoping
they
would
do
at
fraction
of
the
cost
of
other
earbuds
no
complaints
here
i've
had
these
earphones
for
few
weeks
now
and
have
worn
them
cycling
and
driving
one
earbud
in,
and
at
home
while
cooking
and
around
the
house
live
in
noisy
neighborhood
so
the
extra
noisecanceling
quality
is
welcome,
even
if
i'm
not
listening
to
anything
like
that
there
were
different
sizes
of
earbud
cushions
decided
that
needed
combination
of
small
and
medium
to
get
the
best
fit
and
sound
quality
actually
didn't
realize
this
comes
with
microphone
when
bought
it
but
am
glad
for
it
my
brother
said
it
sounded
little
echoy
when
spoke
to
him
on
the
phone,
but
on
the
other
hand,
he
didn't
hear
any
background
car
driving
sounds
during
our
conversation
haven't
tested
the
battery
life
to
the
full
range
but
it
fits
the
needs
of
my
activities
so,
my
sound
quality
as
the
user
is
great
but
expect
the
sound
quality
on
the
other
end
of
the
phone
will
need
more
investigation
these
are
really
great
headphones
they
are
lightweight,
easy
to
use,
and
most
importantly,
comfy
can
wear
these
for
hours
and
they
don't
bother
my
ears
wish
they
were
tad
bit
smaller,
but
have
pretty
small
ears
have
fallen
asleep
with
them
on
numerous
times
also,
the
sound
great
talking
on
the
phone
is
very
easy,
and
it's
very
clear
they
also
sound
good
on
the
other
person's
end
when
i'm
not
using
them,
they
hang
down
and
they
stick
together
with
magnets
so
they
aren't
flying
around
sometimes,
completely
forget
have
them
on
they
are
also
really
great
at
noise
cancelling
couldn't
hear
the
doorbell
would
buy
these
again
absolutely
will
have
to
get
new
one
ever
again
nope
i'm
confident
that
these
will
last
even
if
they
don't,
i'm
even
more
confident
with
the
company
they
seem
so
nice
bought
them
0/0/0
and
today
they
just
died
on
me
they
power
up,
hold
long
charge,
go
into
pairing
mode,
but
no
phone
or
device
can
see
them
anymore
to
pair
with
was
in
the
middle
of
call
when
they
just
'disconnected',
and
haven't
been
able
to
connect
with
or
have
seen
by
anything
since
super
disappointed,
they've
been
the
best
pair
of
headphones
i've
owned
so
far
but
months
is
ridiculous
it's
that
time
of
year
again
when
start
working
out
like
crazy
needed
pair
of
buds
that
actually
stay
in
my
ears
while
running
and
bouncing
around
like
do
these
had
great
price
and
come
wired
which
is
personal
preference
when
picking
out
workout
buds
they
do
exactly
what
needed
them
to
do
along
with
great
sound
and
clarity
battery
stays
well
charged
for
at
least
week's
worth
of
workouts,
too
love
the
cord
length,
weight,
balance,
earfit,
volume,
ease
of
pairing,
and
price
i'm
still
on
my
first
charge
for
day
my
workout
get
pretty
loyal
when
find
favorite
headphone,
but
boltune
won
me
over
on
day
one
this
is
in
large
part
because
they
are
reasonable
demand
lot
of
my
headphones
live
with
headphones
in
and
wear
them
for
saunas
and
workouts
i'm
likely
to
ruin
them
long
before
the
average
user
that
being
said,
how
much
quality
get
for
reasonable
price
is
my
primary
concernboltune
exceeded
my
expectations
there
bought
these
as
gift
for
my
mom
after
she
lost
her
previous
pair
of
earbuds
and
she
loves
them
she
uses
them
to
talk
on
the
phone
and
listen
to
music
while
doing
housework,
so
she
likes
how
there's
no
wire
to
get
snagged
on
our
cabinet
handles
she
says
the
sound
quality
is
amazing
and
everyone
she's
talked
to
over
the
phone
can
vouch
for
the
quality
of
the
microphone
as
for
the
noise
cancellation,
have
to
say
her
name
several
times
before
she
realizes
i'm
trying
to
get
her
attention,
so
i'd
say
it
works
very
well
didn't
realize
this
when
bought
them,
but
the
ends
of
the
earbuds
have
magnets
so
you
can
stick
them
together
to
ensure
they
don't
fall
off
your
neck
overall,
both
she
and
would
highly
recommend
these
for
anyone
looking
to
get
pair
of
high
quality
earbuds
they
can
use
to
make
phone
calls
or
listen
to
music
while
moving
around
lot
love
these
ear
buds
and
for
the
price,
they
are
great
value
enjoy
classic
jazz
that
was
recorded
live
in
smokey
bars
with
these
buds,
can
hear
the
background
conversations,
ice
cubes
tinkling
in
glasses,
the
sound
of
the
musicians'
fingers
on
the
strings
can
get
lost
in
the
sound
they
come
with
extra
tips
and
earpieces
to
fit
everyone
get
two
pair,you
won't
be
disappointed
fit
really
well
and
stay
in
my
ears
bluetooth
distance
is
excellent,
can
walk
around
my
yard
listening
to
audio
and
leave
my
phone
on
the
deck,
they
stay
connected
without
interference
battery
life
is
great,
used
them
all
day
for
days
listening
to
audiobook
without
recharge
like
how
they
stick
together
by
the
magnets,
it
keeps
them
from
getting
tangled
they
pair
quickly
and
automatically
after
first
pairing
definitely
recommend
these
headphones
wear
my
ear
buds
up
to
hours
day
and
since
purchasing
them
month
ago
am
very
satisfied
with
the
sound
quality,
how
comfortable
the
buds
feel
in
my
small
ears,
and
the
ease
of
use
there
were
several
sizes
of
buds
to
choose
from
which
is
usually
standard
for
most
headphones
frequently
misplace
my
buds
so
don't
like
to
pay
almost
$0
for
such
product
but
did
knowing
fully
well
that
they
maybe
gone
tomorrow
since
they
are
magnetized
am
hoping
for
many,
many
months
of
usage
these
are
worth
the
higher
price
just
so
won't
be
so
apt
to
lose
them
because
they
are
securely
around
my
neck
when
not
in
use
bought
pairs
for
me
and
my
wife
both
of
us
are
pleasantly
surprised
each
box
has
bag
to
store
them
and
power
cable
for
chargingsound
is
better
than
expected
considering
the
price,
intuitive
use
and
very
comfortable
for
the
ear
very
fast
to
connect
with
my
mobile
phone
also
delivery
time
was
awesome,
received
it
to
half
of
time
than
notifiedthis
is
the
first
time
bought
boltune
and
definitively
will
do
it
again
i've
been
using
this
headphones
for
couple
days
the
sound
quality
is
better
than
my
previous
headphones
at
similar
price
the
battery
life
is
double
of
my
previous
one
the
pairing
was
easy
there's
one
thing
that
my
previous
headphones
were
better
was
that
it
turns
on
when
you
pull
the
magnet
apart
and
turns
off
when
you
put
them
back
together
it
was
easier
instead
of
having
to
press
the
button
for
seconds
to
turn
on
and
off
my
previous
one
broke
after
year
and
half
of
usage,
hope
this
one
can
last
longer
ordered
one
set
and
the
worded
for
about
times
of
usage
the
all
got
was
static,got
refund,
recorded
same
brand
as
the
sound
was
good
thinking
it
was
one
off,
but
no,
the
second
ones
were
worse
did
not
last
one
time
use
before
the
static
stated
again
don't
know
if
is
due
to
the
wrapping
of
the
cord
for
shipping
ornot,
will
not
order
them
again
bought
these
specifically
for
the
gym
didn
want
to
spend
big
bucks
for
earbuds
that
will
get
sweaty
and
eventually
fail
from
sweat
or
water
the
sound
is
decent
but
if
you
re
an
audiophile
then
these
are
not
for
you
if
you
re
looking
for
decent
sounding
set
that
you
will
abuse
and
aren
going
to
cry
if
they
fail
in
year
then
these
are
great
option
for
you
battery
life
is
great
for
such
small
package
can
get
week
of
workouts
min
each
outta
these
before
charging
they
may
not
stay
on
during
an
intense
crossfit
workout
burpees,etc
but
most
anything
else
they
ll
do
just
fine
like
that
the
cord
is
not
too
long
my
beats
earbuds
wire
was
too
long
and
would
fall
to
one
side
or
another
overall,
great
set
of
budget
earbuds
with
decent
sound
would
recommend
wasn't
expecting
much
from
$0
bluetooth
headphones
but
was
mistaken
ve
wore
them
for
several
plus
mile
runs
and
they
sound
great
and
fit
well
the
sound
from
these
are
great
ve
been
running
with
bose
soundsports
for
over
years
and
have
had
to
replace
them
multiple
times
due
to
swear
killing
them
sweat
lot
during
runs,
especially
in
the
summer,
and
the
bose
earbuds
just
couldn
handle
the
sweat
these
earbuds
are
supposed
to
be
waterproof
and
handle
any
amount
of
sweat
so
far
very
pleased
with
these
earbuds
can
be
beat
for
the
money

amazing
customer
service
after
wrote
the
above
review,
they
emailed
me
asking
how
they
could
make
it
right
they
gave
me
full
refund
and
offered
to
give
me
new
pair
of
their
upgraded
earbuds
or
gift
card
to
amazon
great
customer
service
these
earphones
are
just
ok
giving
stars
for
value,
but
have
shortcomings
in
several
areas
the
earphones
are
heavy,
tend
to
work
loose
with
any
movement,
and
the
sound
quality
is
not
good
with
base
being
anemic
but
the
deal
killer
is
that
the
microphone
pickup
for
phone
conversations
is
poor
unfortunately,
that's
the
main
reason
bought
these
absolutely
love
these
headphones
they
are
comfortable
and
secure
in
my
ear
wear
them
in
the
bed
at
night
to
listen
to
an
audiobook
and
my
husband
doesn't
hear
thing
wear
them
around
the
house
while
doing
other
things
and
they
have
great
range
the
noise
cancellation
is
very
good,
the
sound
quality
is
excellent,
and
would
purchase
these
again
purchased
these
to
use
with
my
sony
receiver's
bluetooth
functionality
for
watching
movies/tv
the
sound
quality
is
outstanding;
was
very
happy
with
it
however,
they
are
not
useable
with
my
av
receiver
as
the
audio
is
out
of
sync
by
second,
give
or
take
for
some
reason
my
receiver
does
not
let
me
manually
adjust
the
av
sync
when
using
bluetooth
as
the
output
this
is
rather
unfortunate
being
that
only
purchased
these
for
this
purpose
these
earbuds
work
great
and
are
an
excellent
value
music
is
an
important
part
of
my
life,
so
sound
quality
is
crucial
when
needed
new
earbuds,
was
careful
because
i've
been
burnt
in
the
past
i'm
glad
chose
these
they're
plenty
comfortable,
but
that's
not
where
it
is
for
me
these
buds
have
great
sound
quality
they
hit
the
his
and
the
lows
with
clarity
and
excellent
stereo
sound
the
equalization
is
perfect,
with
the
bass
at
just
the
right
level
and
the
treble
enhancing
the
sound
just
like
stereo
tweets
highly
recommend
these
buds
for
anyone
whose
music
interests
span
the
gamut
today
went
from
listening
to
tv
on
the
radio,
to
james
brown,
and
on
to
megadeth
the
sound
was
solid
throughout
if
you're
looking
for
quality
buds
to
jam
with,
you've
found
them
stars
great
headphones
must
have
if
you
live
with
your
partner
just
put
these
on
anytime
we
have
an
argument
it's
so
good
because
the
arguments
don't
make
me
frustrated
or
angry
anymore,
thanks
to
these
earphonesreally
helps
with
our
relationshipthe
sound
quality
is
also
very
good
and
battery
life,
for
such
small
headphone,
is
amazing
tooi
sometimes
also
go
for
run,
if
the
arguments
get
too
long,
and
was
running
under
the
rain,
with
no
issues
seems
to
be
waterresistant
wouldn't
go
as
far
as
calling
it
waterproof,
as
am
not
sure
if
these
will
work
in
swimming
pool
or
not
am
member
of
gym
that
has
swimming
pool,
may
try
them
out
next
time
im
there,
this
is
the
0rd
set
of
boltune
headphones
that
ve
purchased
originally
purchased
two
as
christmas
gifts
for
my
daughters
they
use
them
almost
every
day,
and
have
not
had
any
trouble
so
ordered
set
for
myself
the
buds
are
fairly
comfortable
in
my
ears,
and
there
are
different
size
ear
pieces
that
can
be
changed
if
necessary
the
sound
quality
is
great,
the
button
control
is
easy
to
use,
and
like
the
magnetic
tips
to
hold
the
device
around
my
neck
when
not
in
use
the
handy
carry
pouch
is
also
very
convenient
for
throwing
them
in
purse/bag
don
use
these
every
day,
but
ve
only
had
to
charge
them
once
in
two
month
time
bought
these
to
go
with
new
exercise
bike
that
we
recently
purchased
that
only
came
with
corded
earbuds
my
wife
is
not
very
high
tech
and
wanted
simple
pair
of
bluetooth
enabled
headphones
for
her
she
loves
these
cannot
speak
to
battery
life
since
she
always
keeps
them
plugged
in,
but
these
connect
easily
and
she
really
likes
them
only
issue
is
she
will
not
let
me
try
them
love
that
the
packaging
is
pretty
minimal
and
recyclable
with
the
least
amount
of
plastic
possiblepaired
really
easily
with
my
phone
and
couple
of
laptopssound
quality
is
fine
for
me
not
an
audiophilei
do
like
that
the
bass
isn
booming
and
not
overwhelmingpretty
good
value
would
recommend
bought
this
as
replacement
for
one
had
lost,
and
just
like
the
previous
one,
the
battery
life
is
simply
fantastichowever,
for
whatever
reason,
have
to
repair
it
every
single
time
turn
it
on/recharge
it
with
my
devices
which
isn't
showstopper,
but
incredibly
annoyingupdate:the
vendor
contacted
me
and
said
paraphrasing,
we're
sorry
about
your
problems
and
we'd
like
to
make
it
right,
here
are
some
optionsnote,
they
didn't
say,
"if
you
fix
your
review,
here
are
some
options"
they
offered
to
correct
the
issue
regardlessso,
they
took
care
of
me,
and
appreciate
thatas
long
as
they
continue
to
make
quality
products,
will
consider
them
my
number
one
option
did
not
expect
these
earbuds
to
be
so
dang
good
for
the
price
point
as
soon
as
put
them
in
was
floored
by
the
rich
quality
of
the
sound,
literally
could
not
believe
it
and
when
have
them
in
don't
hear
anything
else,
either,
so
think
the
noise
cancellation
is
spot
on
too
just
got
them
so
i've
yet
to
put
them
to
the
test
but
live
in
loud
area
and
with
these
in,
can't
even
hear
my
fan
which
is
pretty
loud,
no
kids
hollerin
outside
my
work
environment
is
super
noisy
and
cannot
wait
to
pit
these
earbuds
against
it
think
it's
gonna
be
swell
definitely
huge
recommendation
from
me
i've
been
skeptical
to
buy
bluetooth
headphones
because
don't
want
to
lose
them
or
have
to
charge
them
i'm
really
glad
made
the
switch
though
love
the
magnetic
pieces
in
the
ear
buds
so
don't
lose
them
often
have
my
headphones
dangling
from
my
shirt
so
this
is
great
way
to
keep
track
of
them
the
sound
quality
is
great
it's
louder
than
any
pair
of
headphones
i've
had
before
and
love
that
can
control
the
volume
and
song
selection
from
the
keypad
on
the
headphones
instead
of
my
phone
also
haven't
had
any
issues
with
the
battery
life
either
glad
made
the
purchase
these
are
okay
not
great
sound,
but
not
bad
they
seem
to
keep
their
charge
all
right
but
wanted
to
wear
something
at
night
to
listen
to
white
noise
since
my
partner
snores
do
not
wear
these
at
night
the
bulky
round
part
at
the
end
of
each
earphone
pushes
the
whole
thing
into
your
ear
canal
very
uncomfortable
you
get
what
you
pay
for
guess
bought
these
for
my
husband's
workouts
and
he
loves
them
he
said
they
are
comfortable,
stay
in
while
jumping
and
moving
around,
loves
the
magnetic
feature
and
the
sound
quality
is
way
better
than
he
expected
from
bluetooth
headphones
if
he
gets
too
far
from
his
phone
about
ft,
the
connection
gets
little
spotty,
but
that's
expected
he
said
the
sound
quality
is
better
than
some
wired
headsets
bought
this
as
last
ditch
effort
before
giving
up
and
trying
the
more
expensive,
namebrand
units
was
so
surprised
by
this
that
will
go
no
further
and
decided
to
write
review
this
unit
has
balanced
overall
sound
level,
not
too
heavy
bass,
but
clear
lows,
mid's
and
high
ranges
the
magnet
to
connect
to
the
two
earpieces
is
strong
and
it
is
comfortable
in
the
ears
like
the
flat,
slightly
larger
cable
it
bends
little
funny,
though
this
unit
looks
robust,
but
time
will
tell
cannot
speak
to
the
battery
life
yet
as
it's
still
on
its
first
charge
it's
great
value
for
the
price
this
product
exceeded
my
expectations
for
the
price
paid
use
these
mainly
when
work
out
at
the
gym
usually
listen
to
talk
radio
or
comedy
stations
and
have
no
issue
with
the
clarity
of
the
sound
the
battery
life
is
longer
than
expected
and
the
wireless
bluetooth
enables
me
to
place
my
phone
in
secure
place
and
be
able
to
listen
to
my
programs
throughout
the
gym
without
any
distortion
or
loss
of
signal
like
the
magnetic
connection
as
it
let's
me
keep
them
around
my
neck
when
not
in
use
instead
of
lying
them
down
somewhere
and
end
up
losing
them
the
setup
was
easy,
just
follow
the
instructions
my
only
issue
and
it's
not
big
one
is
the
compartment
flap
for
charging
is
difficult
to
open
and
it's
tight
fit
to
get
the
charging
wire
in
place
also
the
charging
wire
supplied
is
quite
short
so
far,
these
are
pretty
good
they're
comfortable,
stay
in
my
ears,
sound
quality
is
decent,
and
the
charge
does
hold
well,
but
they
have
to
be
repaired
each
time
they
are
used
my
old
headphones
connected
automatically,
but
with
these,
have
to
tell
my
iphone
to
forget
that
device
and
go
through
the
pairing
process
again
it's
not
deal
breaker,
but
it
is
little
annoying
love
the
battery
life
on
these
headphones
the
sound
is
great
for
the
books
listen
to,
eat
piece
is
comfortablei
recently
lost
these
headphones
and
was
very
disappointed
was
quite
surprised
when
opened
my
clothes
dryer
and
there
they
werei
thought
they
were
toast
but
decided
to
see
if
they
would
charge,
they
did
and
they
still
work
perfectly
these
headphones
are
fantastic
have
been
researching
headphones
for
the
last
month
trying
to
decide
which
ones
to
get
looked
at
beats,
bose,
these
and
few
others
they
came
with
multiple
ear
units
so
that
you
can
find
the
best
fit
for
your
ears
charged
quickly
and
it
was
so
easy
to
connect
to
my
phone
took
literally
five
seconds
ran
over
three
miles
with
them
this
morning
and
did
not
have
to
adjust
them
once
the
sound
quality
is
great
what
difference
it
makes
not
having
an
annoying
wire
in
front
of
your
chest
you
can
beat
this
price
either
highly
recommend
super
fast
shipping
which
is
unheard
of
now
days
ordered
on
wednesday
and
received
on
friday
i've
been
so
surprised
by
how
much
love
these
the
sound
quality
is
truly
excellent,
as
is
the
noise
cancelling
the
navigation
controls
are
fairly
intuitive
and
can
leave
my
phone
on
one
end
of
the
house
and
still
use
these
with
crystalclear
sound
really
great
range
battery
life
is
also
great
use
these
for
several
hours
throughout
the
day
and
only
have
to
recharge
once
every
or
daysi
did
have
some
trouble
getting
them
to
automatically
connect
to
my
phone,
but
the
troubleshooting
information
on
their
site
helped
me
correct
the
problem
and
that's
working
well
now
needed
these
so
can
workout
while
watching
the
news
and
not
disturb
my
wife
while
we
are
stuck
inside
because
of
the
pandemic
needed
earbuds
with
volume
control,
so
these
did
the
job
they
are
very
affordable
so
thought
might
be
getting
disposable
consumer
electronics
like
most
of
the
earbuds
have
had
in
the
pasti
was
pleasantly
surprised
to
get
well
made,
intelligently
designed
device
that
was
easy
to
set
up,
had
clear
easy
to
follow
directions
for
use
and
good
sound
the
controls
are
very
intuitive
and
the
earbuds
are
so
comfortable
that
they
almost
disappearing
after
minute
of
use
would
recommend
these
to
anyone
looking
for
affordable
quality
and
good
audio
reproduction
love
love
love
these
headphones
are
amazing
just
ought
another
pair
for
my
husband
because
he
fell
in
love
with
mine
while
doing
yard
work
and
there
was
an
argument
over
them
can
leave
my
phone
charging
and
walk
all
over
my
house
and
have
clear
signal
listen
all
day
every
day
to
my
audio
books
and
charge
them
about
every
other
day
battery
life
is
solid
hours
do
not
hesitate
to
buy
the
magnet
in
the
earbuds
is
good
and
strong
can
literally
use
them
as
stud
finder
in
the
walls
leaned
over
to
pick
something
up
and
the
headphone
clipped
to
the
wall
and
hung
there
when
sat
back
up
grabbed
these
headphones
as
my
previous
set
of
headphones
were
starting
to
wear
out
and
not
work
as
they
used
to
however,
after
realizing
what
my
last
pair
cost
now
to
replace,
looked
for
replacement
and
here
they
were
they
are
pretty
comfortable
to
wear
for
extended
periods
of
time,
and
while
they
aren't
the
best
in
terms
of
noise
cancellation,
they
work
well
for
what
they
are
you
can't
really
wear
them
with
just
one
earbud
in,
or
it
starts
to
get
really
uncomfortable
as
the
other
ear
bud
starts
to
fall
down
and
pull
at
the
one
in
your
ear,
but
otherwise,
no
complaints
the
battery
life
really
lasts
longer
than
honestly
expected,
can
get
multiple
days
of
usage
out
of
them
based
off
of
few
hours
of
usage
per
day,
and
the
recharge
is
only
couple
of
hours
at
most
truly
recommend
say
these
are
good
quality
for
the
price
ve
owned
pair
of
beats
and
after
the
0nd
pair
broke
didn
want
to
pay
$0+
so
bought
these
first
off
they
are
shorter
than
the
beats
so
that
was
little
weird,
but
not
deal
breaker
the
sound
is
good,
haven
had
any
issues
with
people
hearing
me
while
using
them
for
phone
calls,
so
that
plus
however,
the
weight
distribution
is
horrible
usually
only
have
one
headphone
in
and
with
the
beats
they
stayed
even
on
my
neck
with
no
slipping
these
on
the
other
hand
are
constantly
falling
off
to
the
side
that
is
out
of
my
ear
that
is
extremely
annoying
maybe
that
personal
thing
though
the
ear
pieces
are
magnetic
so
they
do
stick
firmly
together
when
both
are
hanging
headset
is
excellent
for
the
price
most
of
the
feedback
i've
received
which
directly
asked
for
for
the
first
few
days
of
use
was
that
the
sound
of
my
voice
was
quite
clear
haven't
tested
with
music
yet,
but
great
for
phone
calls
battery
life
is
long
only
wish
this
headset
came
with
shirt/collar
clip,
but
otherwise
quite
happy
with
it
am
very
happy
with
this
purchase
the
headphones
arrived
quickly,
and
they
easily
synced
to
my
samsung
galaxy
s0
have
worn
them
while
running
several
times
now,
and
they
don't
fall
out
of
my
ears
which
was
concern
the
sound
quality
is
great
this
is
great
pair
of
wireless
headphones,
especially
considering
how
inexpensive
they
are
these
have
more
bass
than
what
was
expecting
nice
round
full
sound
volume
goes
up
pretty
loud,
full
volume
is
still
bearablefor
short
period
like
the
shorter
cordlongest
point,
outside
of
earbud
to
outside
of
earbud
is
0/0"
took
the
wing
tip
things
off
and
put
on
foam
ear
tips
great
noise
cancelling
and
they
stay
in
my
ears
very,
very
securely
this
way
good
solid
bluetooth
connectionthey
can
be
connected
to
two
different
devices
on
android,
you
have
to
turn
off
either
the
audio
or
calls
portion
of
the
bluetooth
connection
first,
then
connect
to
the
second
device
at
least,
that
is
what
had
to
do
audio
will
not
be
broadcasted
from
the
two
devices
simultaneously
additionally
loved
these
bluetooth
headphones
they
have
great
sound
quality
in
my
opinion
and
were
true
to
advertisement
in
it's
noise
cancelling
ability,
however;
they
stopped
working
after
months
of
use
despite
charging
on
multiple
usb
ac
chargers
was
very
disappointed
because
they
were
my
go
to
headphones
above
all
others
had
in
my
collection
it's
crazy
how
technology
has
advanced
over
the
last
decade,
seriously
remember
when
things
like
this
would
go
for
$0
brand
by
company
that
doesn't
really
care
about
you
lg
now
we
can
all
experience
the
same
quality
for
fast
food
meal
the
base
is
0/0
for
anyone
that's
wondering
it
fits
in
my
ear
like
butter
after
much
research
and
balancing
of
costs
and
features
bought
these
as
my
first
pair
of
wireless
bluetooth
headphones
the
battery
life
gets
me
through
almost
days
of
work
if
in
use
all
day,
and
they
are
so
comfortable
often
forget
am
wearing
them
the
magnetized
back
of
the
earbud
keeps
them
around
your
neck
easily
when
you
remove
them
from
your
ears
they
are
noise
cancelling
enough
to
cut
out
the
racket
of
noisy
office
and
let
you
zone
in
on
your
music
havent
tested
the
waterproof
capabilities
of
these
yet,
but
ran
to
buy
another
pair
when
had
misplaced
the
originals
worth
the
cost
had
pair
of
phaiser
bhs0s
that
finally
kicked
the
bucket
that
were
replacing
pair
of
beatsx,
themselvesboltune
blows
them
out
of
the
waterthey
pair
quickly,
sound
quality
is
superb,
and
the
hour
battery
life
is
legit
use
them
everyday
for
hours
on
end,
and
only
once
had
they
started
warning
me
about
low
battery
when
forgot
to
charge
them
over
nightthe
noise
cancelling
is
really
good
too
leave
them
in
even
when
i'm
not
actively
listening
to
anything,
because
it
helps
me
focusfor
the
price,
they're
an
absoulute
steal
for
low
price,
you
can
buy
these
headphones
and
be
completely
satisfied
sound
reproduction
is
excellent,
with
clear
highs
and
resonant
lows
the
fit
is
great
and
they
don't
fall
out
of
your
ears
as
some
better
known,
higher
priced
models
do
ambient
sound
isolation
is
better
than
average
fast
charging
multiple
ear
bud
sizes
are
bonus
these
headphones
are
great
buy
these
are
great
value
was
considering
purchasing
$0+
earbuds
for
my
husband
who
has
been
working
from
home
during
quarantine
he
wanted
something
he
could
use
for
work
calls
and
zooms
these
are
perfect
and
he
loves
that
they
magnet
connect
to
each
other
so
he
can
clip
them
around
his
neckwhat
great
father's
day
gift
this
is
an
excellent
set
of
earphones/earbuds
great
value
for
the
money
the
sound
quality
is
great,
especially
at
this
price
point
noise
cancellation
isn't
0%,
but
it's
about
as
good
as
it
can
be
for
small
earphones
pairing
is
really
easy,
and
sound
quality
for
calls
is
quite
good
very
easy
to
operate
with
small
instruction
manual
comes
with
extra
ear
buds
and
nice
little
tech
bag
to
store
the
earbuds
and
accessories
would
buy
this
item
again
my
tv
has
bluetooth
capability
and
so
needed
headphones
that
would
be
compatible
as
well
as
providing
decent
volume
level
since
have
moderate
to
severe
hearing
loss
these
fit
the
bill
perfectly
paired
first
time,
retain
the
pairing
properly
and
they
have
very
good
volume
levels
they
sound
better
than
anything
this
size
should
don't
know
how
they
do
that
love,
love
this
headphone
structurally,
feel
durable,
and
the
sound
quality
is
super
clear
without
any
static
noises
the
magnetic
clasp
is
huge
bonus,
because
some
of
my
other
headphones
fall
off
my
shoulder
since
it
was
touted
as
sports
headphones,
it
fits
very
snugly
in
the
earthe
only
thing
was
disappointed
about
was
the
"waterproof"
label,
so
assumed
could
swim
with
them
must
confess,
it
really
is
waterproof
however,
because
of
the
nature
of
bluetooth
and
being
slightly
submerged
in
water,
the
connection
is
lost
simply
put,
it
really
is
waterproof
but
it
cannot
be
used
for
swimming
decided
to
buy
the
waterproof
ipad
shuffle
for
swimming
despite
this,
still
kept
this
headphone
because
it
is
well
worth
the
price
for
superior
quality
headphone
excellent
when
originally
got
the
first
pair,
they
didn
charge
to
full
capacity
leaving
me
with
about
an
0hour
charge
life
knowing
sometimes
this
happens
and
that
it
could
have
been
factory
default
the
company
reached
out
to
me
and
sent
me
second
set
absolutely
love
them
and
kudos
for
the
prompt
service
fairly
early
review,
just
received
them
today,
sharing
my
initial
impressionsi
play
lot
of
golf
and
have
been
looking
for
nice
set
of
earbuds
could
use
on
the
driving
range
and
occasionally
during
practice
rounds
the
earbuds
have
today
constantly
fall
out
of
my
ears
throughout
my
swing
purchased
these
because
it
appears
that
they
will
stay
in
my
ears
without
falling
out
after
receiving
them
today,
ve
switched
around
the
pieces
and
found
the
right
fit
for
me
and
took
about
practice
swings
pleased
to
say,
these
did
not
move
at
allthese
have
solid
sound
and
excited
to
throw
these
in
my
golf
bag
and
have
them
with
me
whenever
playwe
will
see
how
they
hold
up
to
cincinnati
humid
summersoverall
just
solid
set
of
earbuds
for
under
bucks
the
battery
life
is
supposed
to
be
really
great,
but
it
is
the
worst
set
of
headphones
i've
had
when
it
comes
to
battery
life
when
they
arrived
they
were
at
0%
when
charged
them
over
night
they
only
made
it
to
0%
my
husband
has
the
same
pair
and
said
that
0%
would
last
hours
so
took
them
to
work
with
me
and
they
died
minutes
later
after
they
charged
to
0%
minutes
of
listening
brought
them
to
0%
if
they
are
paused
for
more
than
minute,
they
turn
off
they
also
need
to
be
repaired
every
time
turn
them
on
am
so
disappointed
in
these
headphones
maybe
just
got
crap
pair
and
need
new
pair,
but
probably
won't
buy
these
again
since
can't
be
sure
they
work
bought
these
headphones
for
running
and
wow
they
are
amazing
most
headphones
don
stay
in
my
ears
when
run,
but
these
are
fantastic
and
have
never
fallen
out
they
also
don
hurt
your
ears
love
that
they
are
wireless
and
the
bluetooth
connection
has
never
faltered
or
has
been
staticky
recommend
these
to
all
my
friends
who
are
looking
for
workout
headphones
also,
battery
life
is
amazing
having
had
pair
of
atgoin
headphones
for
over
year,
wasnt
sure
what
to
expect
with
these
was
pretty
thrilled
to
see
this
was
total
upgrade
quality
of
sound
is
on
point,
battery
life
amazing
and
the
range
of
these
puppies
are
incredible
was
working
out
at
the
gym
and
left
my
phone
in
the
studio
while
wandered
to
the
bathroom
and
had
loss
have
nothing
bad
to
say
about
these
headphones
have
pair
of
beats
wired
earbuds
and
never
use
them
because
they
fall
out
of
my
ear
no
matter
what
bud
size
use
these
boltunes
are
light,
comfortable,
sound
great
and
barely
move
they
pair
up
to
my
note
easily
and
are
simple
to
operate
originally
bought
them
for
my
wife
but
liked
them
so
much
got
myself
one
too
thumbs
up
was
looking
for
nice
solid
quality
midrange
pair
of
earbuds
pair
that
can
be
easily
kept
up
with
but
not
devastated
if
misplaced
lost
or
stolen
my
brother
suggested
this
pair
of
buds
saying
they
are
perfect
for
commuter
or
fitness
junkie
my
pops
does
both
but
using
his
iphone
factory
buds
so
decided
to
upgrade
him
for
his
birthday
this
fall
and
he
loves
themthese
buds
offer:•
quality
music
sound•
solid
battery
life•
security
with
the
magnetic
bud
clamp•
clear
voice
and
talk
quality•
fashionably
designed
did
purchased
and
used
this
since
april
0,
and
think
this
bluetooth
headphone
has
good
sound
quality
but
not
an
excellence
one
it
has
very
good
price
and
also
has
very
strong
bass
and
excellence
noise
cancellation
about
the
bluetooth
is
not
so
great
because
sometime
it
dropped
out
the
connection
so
have
to
reset
it
but
think
that
is
not
the
problem
am
very
impressed
about
the
battery,
turn
it
on
the
whole
my
hours
working
shift
and
then
it
depleted
only
percent
of
battery
these
are
excellent
bluetooth
earbuds
in
all
ways
they
easily
paired
with
my
phone
and
laptop;
the
sound
is
clear
and
crisp;
and
the
fit
in
my
ear
is
excellent
these
are
very
comfortable
and
work
great
when
am
working
out
and
listening
to
audible
lost
my
first
pair
and
just
received
my
second
pair
from
amazon
the
quality
is
consistent
_will
update,
with
full
week
use_i
must
say,
like
these
headphones
off
the
bat
they
feel
solid
with
that
in
mind,
am
hard
on
my
headphones
so
we
shall
see
how
durable
they
are
id
rate
them
at
an
overall
0,
though
will
update
this
when
see
how
the
battery
holds
up
would
recommend
these
so
far
really
love
these
earphones
use
them
days
week
alternating
between
&
on
my
run/walks
it
rained
on
me
few
times
and
didn
affect
them
at
allwill
have
to
see
when
the
sun
starts
blazing
this
summer
if
they
can
still
hold
up
got
the
added
asurion
warranty
just
incasefor
the
price
these
are
gem
so
far
these
are
easy
to
use
and
set
up
can
give
stars
because
sound
quality
isn't
great,
but
just
about
what
you
expect
from
$0
headphones
good
enough,
but
won
wow
you
like
that
they
come
with
extra
fittings
for
your
ear
because
the
factory
set
were
too
small
they
fit
nice
and
snug
now,
though
the
function
bar
is
little
bulky
and
bounces
little
more
than
like
for
running,
but
that
me
being
picky
overall
solid
pair
of
headphones
and
so
far
the
battery
is
still
showing
full
charge
after
about
minutes
of
use
time
will
tell
if
they
truly
last
hours
purchased
for
work,
needing
bluetooth
headset
with
speaker
to
link
to
computerdelivery
was
within
days
of
ordering,
which
greatly
appreciated
during
the
pandemic
once
charge,
setup
took
less
than
minutes
longest
i've
used
thus
far
was
for
hours
and
charge
held
replaced
the
earbud
cover
with
smaller
set
that
was
included
and
it
felt
more
comfortable
the
next
use
appreciate
there
is
large,
medium
and
small
set
of
earbud
covers
for
comfort
quality
of
sound
is
good
and
those
on
the
other
end
hear
me
wellonly
thing
that
would
make
this
set
better
would
be
to
allow
wireless
charging,
such
as
in
casei
did
receive
offer
for
gift
card
for
writing
review
really
like
the
fit
of
these
in
my
ears
they
really
lock
into
place
all
the
features
work
great
and
the
sound
quality
is
good
great
battery
life
the
bluetooth
works
great
right
after
they
synch,
unlike
some
of
my
less
expensive
headphones
where
it
takes
about
seconds
before
you
get
clear
connection
only
wish
that
the
chord
was
couple
inches
longer
their
battery
life
is
fantastic
was
skeptical
of
the
stated
time,
but
they
seem
to
be
exceeding
itthe
magnets
in
them
keep
them
from
slipping
off
when
not
in
your
earsi
also
enjoy
the
mass
they
addthe
ear
things
fit
like
glove
and
seem
to
block
out
lot
of
noiseoverall,
these
are
an
upgrade
from
my
aging
skullcandy
sb0s
more
battery
life,
better
ergonomics,
comparable
sound
quality
these
headphones
have
great
sound
the
bass
and
noise
cancellation
is
better
than
many
of
the
headphones
i've
bought
over
the
yearsafter
using
these
little
longer
decided
to
update
my
review
they
have
excellent
battery
life
as
well
as
water
proof
have
pool
and
accidentally
dropped
them
in
after
drying
them
off
they
worked
just
fine
updating
the
review
due
to
great
customer
service
they
are
issuing
refund
and
contacted
me,,
which
really
appreciatethese
headphones
were
amazing
until
they
stopped
working
they
keep
pairing
to
my
phone
then
few
seconds
later
it
disconnects
and
pairs
again
it
won't
keep
the
connection
love
the
sound
quality
and
battery
life,
but
this
issue
popped
up
after
months
of
use
am
really
disappointed
bought
these
same
buds
while
ago
and
loved
them
the
battery
life
is
excellent
and
the
sound
quality
is
very
impressive
for
the
price
no,
they
won
replace
your
etymotic
research
or
other
audiophile
cans,
but
you
don
need
to
take
out
second
mortgage
either
imo,
for
the
price,
they
can
be
beat
this
review
is
more
of
warning
that
mice
love
to
chomp
on
the
silicone
live
off
grid
and
mice
are
part
of
my
life
ll
be
more
careful
this
time
around
after
trying
different
ones,
these
pack
the
longest
charge
in
month,
used
it
for
over
hours
when
the
battery
is
dying
have
minutes
left
before
it
dies
the
notification
only
reminds
me
it's
dying
once
every
few
minutes
unlike
other
models
that
beep
every
seconds,
making
them
useless
it
pairs
very
well
and
never
powers
off
unless
disconnected
the
center
button
works
perfectly
pause,
forward,
rewind
by
0,
0,
or
presses
this
set
of
headphones
is
replacement
for
my
older,
bulkier
set
that
lost
love
the
smaller
form
factor
at
the
ear
the
three
button
remote
built
into
he
connecting
cable
is
easy
to
reach
and
use
without
confusing
what's
what
sound
quality
is
on
par
with
the
price
range
little
equalizer
adjustment
in
spotify
gave
deeper
bass
and
fuller
soundi
would
recommend
this
anyone
who
is
looking
for
an
affordable
choice
of
wireless
headphones
as
person
with
small
ears
these
earbuds
were
exactly
what
have
been
looking
for
after
much
internet
research,
decided
to
give
these
tryso
far
they
have
been
perfection
quality
is
great
clear,
crisp,
they
are
light
weight
and
the
smallest
size
of
covers
fit
perfectly
into
my
small
ears,
no
falling
out,
no
feeling
like
have
something
jammed
in
my
ear
love
that
they
are
magnetic
so
if
need
to
unplug
can
have
them
around
my
neck
and
not
forget
where
put
them
charge
is
great,
connection
easyi
have
them
in
grey
but
once
work
starts
up
again
will
definitely
be
buying
second
pair
to
keep
and
use
there
cannot
tell
you
how
many
pairs
of
ear
buds
have
bought
over
the
years
only
to
be
disappointed
they
were
not
suitable
for
my
small
ears
was
really
looking
forward
to
getting
these,
but
once
they
disconnect
from
your
device
or
turn
them
off,
you
have
to
manually
pair
them
again
each
and
everytime
you
want
to
use
them
also
recieved
call
while
listening
to
spotify
and
for
some
reason,
they
automatically
disconnected
from
my
phone
and
have
not
been
able
to
repair
them
tried
turning
everything
off
then
back
on,
paired
them
then
unpaired
them
and
they
won't
even
come
up
as
device
that
can
pair
with
anymore
it's
very
weird
do
not
reccomend
really
like
these
earphones
don't
recommend
this
experiment,
but
accidentally
left
them
in
my
pants
pocket
which
then
went
through
the
wash,
and
afterwards
it
still
worked
for
time
little
latter
it
stopped
turning
on,
so
though
the
water
wrecked
it,
so
set
it
aside
but
then
several
days
later
put
it
on
the
charger
for
couple
of
hours,
and
then
tried
it
again
and
it
worked
that's
pretty
durable
sound
quality
is
pretty
good
for
the
price
point,
these
say
they
are
noise
canceling
but
i'm
not
sure
if
they
are
dont
notice
difference
other
than
the
noise
canceling
you
get
from
them
being
earbuds
battery
life
is
decent,
but
they
are
new
so
we
will
see
one
drawback
is
the
weight,
the
earbuds
are
very
heavy,
so
heavy
that
they
will
slide
to
one
side
if
you
take
one
earbud
off
for
short
time,
i've
returned
at
least
three
other
pairs
of
headphones
because
they
did
not
fit
these
very
conveniently
came
with
three
different
rubber
tips
for
all
size
ears
they
stay
in
well
when
i'm
walking
something
i've
really
struggled
with
when
i've
used
different
types
of
headphones
also
didn't
realize
that
they
are
magnetic,
so
they
stick
to
one
another
when
you're
not
using
them
get
cheap
pair
of
bluetooth
earbuds
about
every
months
was
going
to
buy
the
last
set
again
but
they
were
nowhere
to
be
found
these
are
solid
they
sound
good
and
the
mic
seems
to
work
well
on
calls
the
fit
isn't
great
even
with
the
silicone
insert
options
the
battery
life
is
amazing
best
battery
on
budget
buds
i've
ever
seen
so
far
so
good
this
is
my
second
pair
of
the
original
version
of
these
earbuds
haven't
had
chance
to
put
them
through
their
paces
yet
but
my
first
impression
is
positive
these
earbuds
sound
fantastic
they
have
rich
base,
clear
highs,
and
soaring
mids
the
controls
function
well,
they
pair
effortlessly,
and
the
build
quality
is
solid
can't
speak
to
the
battery
life
of
this
pair
yet
but
my
original
pair
lasted
hrs
day
days
week
for
little
over
year
hope
these
work
as
well
will
update
this
review
when
i've
had
them
for
awhile
waited
few
weeks
to
give
an
educated
review
i've
been
waiting
to
buy
some
bluetooth
headphones
for
while,
and
i've
been
very
happy
with
these,
so
far
am
using
these
constantly
and
only
have
to
charge
them
every
few
days,
so
they
seem
to
be
holding
charge
very
well
the
noise
cancelation
works
well
have
to
be
careful
around
the
house
because
people
try
to
get
my
attention
and
don't
hear
them,
but
it
isn't
too
much
where
feel
unsafe
having
them
on
in
public
like
that
they
are
magnetic
and
can
hang
around
your
neck
when
not
in
use,
but
do
wish
the
design
was
just
bit
sleeker,
since
they
stick
out
from
your
ears
more
than
other
earbuds
still,
it
isn't
noticeable
if
you
have
long
hair
over
your
ears
frequently
drive
for
long
distances,
and
my
ac
doesn't
work,
so
drive
on
the
highway
with
the
windows
down
you
can
imagine
the
noise
from
wind
and
trucks
passing
by
these
headphones
muffle
the
noise
enough
to
feel
sane
while
still
being
able
to
hear
just
enough
to
be
safe
on
the
road
am
also
very
sensitive
to
high
pitched
noises,
and
sometimes
other
headphones
will
make
the
higher
pitched
sounds
in
music
unbearable
for
me
the
sound
quality
is
smooth
on
these
what
i'm
most
impressed
by
is
the
battery
life
the
first
time
charged
them
kept
making
hour
drives,
expecting
by
the
third
or
fourth
time
that
the
battery
would
die
out
it
took
much
longer
than
expected
very
happy
with
my
purchase
seems
to
block
out
most
all
outside
noise
when
music
is
on
the
fit
was
ok,
not
as
good
as
the
samsung
level
used
to
have
when
the
right
ear
isn't
in
it
pulls
the
other
headphone
out
of
the
other
ear
sound
quality
is
just
ok
but
for
the
price
very
good
we
will
see
the
longevity
but
overall
seem
pretty
nice
these
bad
boys
sound
great,
have
amazing
battery
life,
and
survived
over
two
months
lost
in
my
yard
even
bought
new
pair
when
the
old
pair
was
lost
well
found
them
today
and
they
still
work
after
days
of
rain,
about
inches
of
snow,
and
weeks
of
extreme
cold
they
still
sound
great
with
the
same
clear
sound
and
decent
bass
they
had
from
day
one
paired
easily
with
windows
pc,
my
android
phone
and
roku
tv
charged
quickly
are
comfortable
to
wear
and
the
magnetic
"clasping"
keeps
them
around
my
neck
when
not
in
usehaven't
drained
them
yet,
but
am
not
using
them
continuously
extra
pieces
are
big
plus
as
is
the
carry
bagwould
recommend
you
won
find
anything
else
quite
as
nice
at
twice
the
price
seriously,
these
are
the
best
value
ve
had
ve
become
bit
obsessed
with
totally
wireless
earbuds,
and
these
are
every
bit
as
good
as
two
other
pair,
one
at
0x
the
price
and
another
at
0x
the
price
they
are
very
comparable
to
my
experience
with
airpods,
from
sound
to
functionality
to
fit
ve
had
couple
other
pairs
at
this
price
and
always
find
they
have
terrible
sound
or
an
echo,
where
the
sides
are
out
of
sync
these
are
super
easy
to
pair,
sound
great,
and
have
no
echo
word
of
caution
though,
if
apple
earbuds
hurt
your
ears
because
of
the
shape,
these
may
also
it
an
issue
personally
run
into
with
many
earbuds,
but
bit
picky
because
use
custom
molded
earpieces
at
work
just
don
think
you
can
go
wrong
at
this
price
though
the
headphones
work
great
have
bought
pair
of
these
about
0months
ago
and
decided
to
get
another
pair
since
use
them
at
work
and
at
home
use
them
everyday
for
my
0hr
shift
and
they
always
stay
charged
the
sound
is
good
quality
and
the
mic
works
as
it
should
during
calls
they
are
comfortable
in
my
ears
and
when
stowed
around
my
neck
they
magnet
together
nicely
would
recommend
them
to
others
this
is
the
first
time
purchased
earbuds
of
this
type
planned
to
use
them
for
teaching
during
covid,
but
they
have
been
out
to
walk
the
dog
and
do
landscaping
was
especially
impressed
with
how
well
they
stayed
in
while
working
on
heavy
duty
landscaping
project
the
size
options
are
nice
for
both
the
buds
and
fins
would
recommend
pros:long
battery
lifevery
easy
and
straightforward
paring
with
my
devicestays
in
my
ear
very
well,
problem
that
had
been
having
with
other
earbudseasy
to
navigate
buttons,
including
volume
control,
play/pause,
answering
incoming
calls,
etccons:not
the
absolute
best
sound
quality
you'll
find
out
there,
but
it
does
the
job
in
my
case,
listen
mostly
to
podcasts
and
audiobooks,
so
this
isn't
as
much
of
concern
for
methe
cord
is
bit
long
for
my
taste,
but
i've
tied
knot
to
shorten
it
bit
to
make
it
less
unwieldyoverall,
good,
solid
product
if
sound
quality
is
super
important
to
you,
you'll
probably
have
to
find
more
expensive
set
of
headphones
purchased
the
item
based
on
all
the
reviews
was
looking
for
something
reasonably
priced
that
provides
good
sound
so
far,
am
please
with
my
purchase
the
sound
quality
is
good
and
clear
with
decent
bass,
not
overwhelming
for
the
price,
think
this
is
really
good
purchase
cannot
comment
on
the
battery
life
at
this
time
will
need
additional
time
to
use
it
enjoy
these
headphones
so
much
have
bought
pair
one
for
work,
one
for
home,
and
one
for
my
wifei
work
hour
night
shifts
and
like
to
listen
to
music
and
podcasts
as
work
these
headphones
have
excellent
sound
quality
and
last
the
entire
shift
on
one
chargethe
sound
quality
and
battery
life
at
this
price
point
is
steal
use
these
while
hiking
in
the
hollywood
hills
walk
up
and
run
down,
and
they
have
no
issues
staying
in
my
ears
over
the
rocky
terrainif
you
use
pods
usually,
you
will
notice
that
these
are
far
more
tin
sounding
than
highend
headphones,
but
they
work
great
and
sound
fantastic,
especially
for
the
price
after
trying
several
different
bluetooth
earbud
options,
this
one
is
my
favorite
so
far
what
love:0
low
price0
great
sound0
stay
in
my
ears0
easy
pairingthese
arrived
days
ago,
so
too
soon
to
know
what
they
will
be
like
longterm
happy
so
far
for
so
many
things
to
be
great
with
them
my
big
beef
with
these
is
that
don't
get
battery
warning
until
about
minutes
before
it
runs
out
of
juice
not
helpful
if
i'm
out
for
while;
would
rather
know
when
it's
half
depleted
so
can
remember
to
charge
when
get
home
before
my
next
outingotherwise,
very
good
quality
sound
and
the
price
is
right
bought
these
wireless
earplugs
to
replace
my
airpods
for
my
galaxy
note
phone
because
the
airpods
always
disconnects
with
my
phone
it
really
annoying
these
earplugs
stably
connects
with
my
phone,
and
the
wear
is
very
comfortable
don
like
to
use
the
earloop,
so
take
it
off
:ps
the
reception
range
is
farther
than
airpods
needed
bluetooth
earphone
not
only
for
listening
to
music
when
walk
but
also
take
numerous
calls
and
meetings
as
we
all
are
working
remote
now
when
was
researching
for
an
affordable
bluetooth
earphone
most
of
them
at
this
price
range
had
very
bad
call/microphone
quality
in
reviews
used
boltune
wired
earphones
before
and
was
very
happy
with
it
needed
bluetooth
one
as
upgraded
my
iphone
and
that
does
not
work
with
0/0
inch
jacki've
been
using
this
for
over
week,
and
attended
lots
of
meetings
and
everyone
at
the
receivers
end
acknowledged
that
they
did
not
have
any
issues
hearing
me
clearly
this
was
important
to
meand
finally,
the
magnet
that
ties
the
earphones
like
pendant
is
cool
and
handy
thing
to
have
when
not
in
use
pairing
was
breeze,
didn't
even
need
the
manual
the
sound
quality
and
fit
is
great
like
the
magnetic
feature
to
prevent
them
from
falling
when
they
are
not
in
my
earsi
have
not
used
them
in
noisy
environment
so
my
star
rating
is
set
to
for
that
the
same
goes
for
the
battery
life,
as
haven't
used
the
headphones
long
enough
for
the
battery
to
drain
their
customer
service
reached
out
to
me
after
wrote
review
about
my
broken
headphones
they
sent
me
replacement
pair
in
addition,
they
also
sent
me
another
model
of
wireless
headphones
that
plan
on
trying
and
writing
review
foroverall,
i'm
very
impressed
did
not
expect
them
to
replace
my
broken
pair
good
quality,
good
value
and
great
customer
service
wish
the
cord
was
slightly
longer
just
so
when
turned
my
head
there
was
little
more
freedom
but
it's
not
too
badsound
is
great
and
even
when
the
music
is
blaring
at
my
gym,
can
still
hear
my
music
as
the
dominant
sourcevery
comfortable
in
the
ears
too
my
only
complaint
is
the
cord
should
be
bit
longer
this
for
when
using
it
to
make
calls
maybe
one
more
inch
the
microphone
is
usually
hanging
just
below
and
behind
my
ear
it
not
long
enough
to
stay
in
location
where
the
mic
can
receive
my
voice
clearly
find
need
to
hold
the
mic
closer
to
my
mouth
when
talking
edit:customer
service
was
excellent
they
have
offered
me
refund
for
the
detective
pairoriginal:for
about
month
they
worked
fine,
my
only
complaint
was
that
getting
water
on
the
speaker
part
easily
muffled
the
audio
and
you
had
to
blow
air
in
them
pretty
vigorously
to
hear
againthen
they
started
having
problems
sometimes
the
power
button
wouldn't
work,
and
couldn't
turn
them
off
just
had
to
turn
off
bluetooth
and
wait
for
them
to
turn
off
automatically
they
also
cause
media
to
skip
don't
meant
that
they
occasionally
cause
you
to
skip
few
seconds
mean
they
get
stuck
in
like
"fast
forward"
mode,
constantly
skipping
when
was
looking
online
at
the
various
selection
of
ear
buds,
came
across
these
ones
was
little
skepticalthe
price
was
cheaper
than
most
good
quality,
and
wasn't
sure
how
the
ear
hook
was
going
to
work
bought
them
thinking
if
they
didn't
work,
could
return
them
as
soon
as
they
came,
tested
them
outwow
they
fit
perfectly
inside
my
small
ears,
and
they
were
easy
to
pair/charge
and
connect
to
bluetooth
device
the
battery
life
lasts
very
long
time,
and
it
doesn't
take
very
long
to
chargei
like
when
you
turn
them
on/off,
it
tells
you
if
it
is
turned
on/off
and
connected/disconnected
the
sound
quality
is
very
good,
and
the
noise
cancellation
works
great
especially
for
earbudsvery
happy
with
purchase
and
would
definitely
recommend
and
buy
again
to
start
off,
received
my
first
pair
of
these
and
when
tried
them,
only
one
side
worked
contacted
the
company
and
immediately
they
sent
out
another
pair
even
before
returned
the
original
ones
was
little
worried
untill
tried
them
out
with
music
clear
and
great
sound,
fits
great
and
super
noise
canceling
way
better
then
my
last
pair
and
so
worth
the
price
also
when
you
answer
phone
call
the
headphone
voice
is
pleasant
and
you
can
hear
perfectly
who
your
talking
to
even
went
out
in
windy
day
and
my
other
line
couldn't
tell
was
outside
worked
hour
shift
and
when
was
finished
they
still
had
0%
battery
life
left
thats
unbelievable
would
definitely
recommend
these
to
anyone
was
little
skeptical,
because
have
been
having
trouble
finding
the
right
ear
buds
fit
and
comfortably
while
keeping
good
and
high
quality
soundthis
is
nothing
what
thought
wowsound
and
quality
is
superb
the
music
tone
is
so
smooththe
earbuds
are
very
comfortable
and
easy
to
put
in
they
also
come
with
silicone
base
hooks
that
fit
with
different
sized
buds
for
perfect
fit
fabulous
and
better
than
expected
i'm
really
surprised
how
loud
and
high
volume
this
product
can
get
would
highly
recommend
these
if
you
want
for
relaxing
or
rocking
out
to
your
favorite
musici
like
to
use
them
when
we
travel
and
give
one
of
the
earbuds
to
my
girlfriend
so
we
can
watch
the
same
movie
togetherthis
product
is
great
value
was
looking
for
cheap
earphones
with
good
sound
quality
for
more
than
hours
of
music
found
this
earbuds
and
read
good
reviews
ordered
without
great
expectations
after
open
the
box
realized
i'm
wrong
it
was
great
quality
for
its
price
recommend
this
earbuds
for
these
reasons
;first
packing
design
and
parts
are
very
luxurioussecond,
it
can
be
play
over
hours,
greatthird,
it
has
rich
soundforth,
easy
paring
use
my
earbuds
every
day
at
work
the
charge
life
seems
to
last
me
about
week
or
more
the
only
thing
dislike
is
they
are
bit
uncomfortable
but
that
could
be
because
just
left
the
rubber
earpieces
they
came
with
in
could
change
them
out
for
another
one
they
came
with
and
it
might
be
more
comfortable
so
far,
the
best
bluetooth
headphones
i've
ever
used
the
range
is
amazing
audio
quality
is
good
and
clear,
with
decent
lows,
but
with
hissing
sound
on
quiet
music
battery
life
is
amazing
and
love
that
there
are
controls
on
the
cord
for
controller
playback
can't
comment
on
audio
on
calls
because
like
to
put
the
phone
to
my
ear
have
switched
to
using
wireless
headphones
while
working
out
for
couple
years
and
these
are
the
most
efficient
have
found
so
far
the
sound
quality
is
great,
but
what
separates
them
from
other
headphones
is
the
magnetic
tips
which
let
them
easily
lock
around
my
neck
or
be
attached
to
any
metal
surface
the
headphone
itself
also
fits
better
into
my
ear
than
any
other
wireless
ones
i've
used
the
ones
i've
used
before
i'd
lose
or
break
within
couple
months,
and
could
notice
the
battery
life
decreasing
these
have
never
left
behind
or
had
trouble
finding,
have
never
damaged
doing
physical
activity,
and
have
not
noticed
the
battery
life
falling
all
in
all
these
headphones
are
much
more
convenient
than
any
other
wireless
headphones
i've
used
thought
these
were
great
for
the
price
and
they
worked
great
and
were
the
most
comfortable
earbuds
ve
owned,
but
they
suddenly
stopped
working
after
months
but
contacted
boltune
and
they
immediately
offered
to
replace
them
or
give
me
$0
credit
paid
less
than
$0
for
them
their
customer
service
is
great
and
ll
definitely
buy
from
them
again
ordered
two
of
these
headphones,
one
for
me
and
one
for
the
husband
my
husband
loves
them,
and
do
too
the
battery
life
is
incredibly
long,
and
the
sound
quality
is
amazing
my
husband
will
not
use
any
other
headphones
now
for
the
price
they
are
an
incredible
bargain
love
these
headphones
they
come
with
the
set
of
headphones
which
are
magnetic
and
attach
to
each
other,
extra
ear
pieces,
charging
cord,
and
mesh
carrying
bagthe
headphones
block
out
all
noise,
and
the
sound
quality
is
amazing,
and
much
better
then
you
expect
from
headphones
great
bass,
and
very
clear
sound
love
them
got
them
about
month
ago
and
im
super
happy
with
the
whoke
experience
the
order
was
delivered
fast,
with
the
cutest
packagingi
wanted
to
see
how
long
the
battery
lives
before
writing
review
and
now,
after
months
can
honestly
say
it
lasts
more
than
week
i'm
using
them
at
least
hours
per
dayone
other
thig
that
was
concerned
is
whether
it
will
hold
on
to
my
ear
and
if
it
will
be
painful
well,
they
never
fell
ofd
my
ears
and
basically
dont
feel
have
them
on
just
awesome
she's
been
breaking
headphones
back
to
back
that
we
had
to
give
warning
so
far
it
has
been
weeks
and
hear
no
complaints
the
kids
are
so
exposed
to
tech
that
when
device
is
no
good
they
will
tell
us
immediately
the
magnetic
design
makes
it
more
durable
i'm
just
glad
it's
working
out
well
and
not
breaking
excellent
battery
life
really
like
these
they
seem
to
have
more
dynamic
sound
range
than
my
airpod
pros
when
it
comes
to
listening
to
music
they
stay
in
my
ear
even
while
doing
burpees
and
jump
roping
the
battery
last
quite
awhile
and
they
charge
really
fast
overall
for
$0
these
are
really
great
headphones
the
only
thing
that
wasn't
the
biggest
fan
of
at
first
was
the
volume
changer
in
the
front
it
took
bit
of
time
to
get
use
to,
but
also
just
wasn't
expecting
it
since
didn't
notice
it
in
the
photo
of
the
product
the
only
negative
thing
can
say
about
these
headphones
is
that
keep
losing
them
we
have
ordered
pair
so
far
for
my
household
unfortunately,
they
do
slip
off
of
my
neck
when
forget
to
stick
the
magnets
together
have
now
improvised
by
attaching
an
office
clip
onto
the
cord
that
can
attach
to
my
shirt
the
sound
quality
on
these
headphones
is
great
and
noise
cancellation
works
well
there
were
couple
of
problems
had
with
these
headphones
0st
the
cord
is
way
too
short,
causing
the
speakers
to
pull
out
of
my
ear
when
turned
my
head
also
had
to
manually
sync
the
blue
tooth
to
my
phone
every
time
bought
these
because
was
tired
of
the
cheap
sets
from
walmart
with
connectivity
issues
and
not
being
loud
enough
for
workouts
these
connected
to
both
my
phone
and
laptop
within
seconds
with
no
problems
at
all,
and
the
sound
quality
is
great
noise
cancellation
wasn't
high
priority
for
me
because
sometimes
need
to
be
able
to
hear
things
around
me
but
it
is
very
muffled
so
would
say
they
are
good
for
that
battery
life
is
great
and
the
sound
is
awesome,
especially
for
the
price
paid
for
these
also
love
the
magnets
in
the
backs
of
the
earbuds;
that
helps
lot
to
keep
them
untangled
would
recommend
and
buy
again
like
the
fact
that
it
was
noise
cancellation
was
awesome
the
problem
that
had
was
can
not
charge
them
no
more
the
charger
that
came
with
them
do
not
work
brought
charger
and
it
did
not
work
either
have
these
awesome
ear
phone
can
not
use
because
am
unable
to
charge
them
not
only
do
have
to
buy
another
ear
phones
wasted
my
money,
only
had
them
for
one
month
am
not
happy
about
that
at
all
use
the
headphones
to
listen
to
streaming
video
while
walking
on
treadmillthe
sound
quality
is
good
for
budget
headphones
they
shut
out
most
but
not
all
the
the
treadmill
noise
the
controls
are
easy
to
use
they
have
fallen
out
of
my
ears
couple
of
times,
care
must
be
taken
when
putting
them
in
your
earsi
have
used
these
about
two
months
so
their
durability
is
unknown
overall
these
headphones
suited
my
needs
just
was
looking
for
cheap
bluetooth
headphones
that
worked
well
enough
to
watch
videos
and
listen
to
music
from
my
phone
the
noise
cancellation
was
decent,
but
nothing
like
the
super
high
quality
you
can
get
with
$0+
headphones
haven't
tested
the
waterproofness
of
them
yet,
but
don't
want
to
accidentally
ruin
them
so
probably
won't
just
based
on
other
reviews
my
main
issue
is
just
the
way
the
look
because
they're
little
bulkier
than
like
but
that's
not
huge
deal
really
like
the
magnet
feature;
it's
actually
way
more
useful
than
would
have
thought
overall,
these
are
really
good
for
the
price
and
i'm
glad
bought
them
searched
for
pair
of
bluetooth
headphones
and
chose
this
one
based
on
the
reviews
and
the
price
work
hour
shifts
and
they
haven't
died
during
my
shift
they
have
little
bit
more
range
than
my
last
pair
so
can
leave
my
phone
charging
and
walk
further
away
was
skeptical
about
the
buds
stating
in
my
ears
but
have
caught
the
wire
on
things
at
work
and
have
not
yet
yanked
them
out
it
comes
with
different
size
ear
pieces
so
you
can
find
the
right
fit
overall
very
happy
with
the
purchase
and
recommend
for
all
day
users
these
little
headphones
rock
there
are
quite
as
loud
as
they
hope
but
the
bass
is
extraordinary
also
note
the
battery
life
is
very
long
and
when
connected
to
my
samsung
a0
they
do
tell
you
exactly
how
long
the
batteries
last
for
magnets
in
the
headphones
meme
don't
lose
my
headphones
so
can
put
them
on
easy
when
get
call
these
wireless
bluetooth
headphones
are
just
what
wanted
very
comfortable,
lightweight,
and
they
sound
great
the
battery
lasts
hours
on
one
charge
they
have
easy
to
use
controls
and
connect
quickly
with
bluetooth
they
stay
in
my
ear
and
don't
fall
out
use
them
every
day
amended
after
posting
the
review
before,
was
contacted
by
boltune
who
apologized
and
offered
me
different
combinations
of
their
products
including
three
of
the
earbuds
that
broke
impressive
the
products
have
arrived
and
have
not
used
them
yet,
but
as
appreciated
the
quality
of
sound
of
the
orginal
earphones,
i'm
looking
forward
to
using
the
new
onesoriginal:frustrating
experience
as
enjoyed
the
product
sound
quality
was
good;
fairly
comfortable
around
the
neck
paired
quickly
all
would
be
fine,
but
it
suddenly
stopped
working
after
months
of
occasional
use
that
is
simply
not
acceptable
feel
very
comfortable,
it
won't
hurt
if
wear
it
for
long
time
its
design
is
very
special,
put
in
the
ear
to
listen,
do
not
let
the
ear
have
any
pressure,
hang
freely
around
the
neck,
the
earplug
magnet
will
close,
streamlined
design
will
bring
good
comfort
love
the
style
and
prefer
how
it
wraps
around
my
neck
versus
cordless
ones
like
airpods
as
well
as
traditional
ones
with
the
cords
am
pleased
with
this
purchase
and
would
recommend
this
product
and
vendor
to
anyone
looking
for
this
type
of
product
bought
these
headphones
based
on
the
many
0star
reviews
overall,
these
deliver
on
features,
but
can't
quite
give
them
0stars
starting
with
the
pros:
good
sound
quality,
noisecanceling/reduction
is
very
good,
comfortable
to
wear
at
my
desk
or
doing
light
activity,
good
price
cons:
the
earbuds
are
heavy,
so
not
sure
would
enjoy
using
these
for
working
out
most
annoying
is
they
seem
to
lose
connection
at
random
times
like
when
i'm
on
callthe
nice
voice
you
hear
when
the
headphones
get
connected
randomly
starts
saying
"connected/disconnected"
over
and
over
several
times
hopefully,
someone
on
the
receiving
end
of
this
message
can
help
me
with
this
have
been
through
at
least
different
kinds
of
bluetooth
magnetic
earbuds
in
the
last
year
am
pretty
rough
with
them
but
this
has
been
the
best
so
far
like
that
the
cord
is
extra
thick
and
durable,
so
they
wont
break
as
easily
if
snap
them
on
my
clothing
or
face
mask
they
stay
in
my
ears
when
running
and
don't
budge
when
i'm
sweating
or
doing
decline
weights
they
have
great
sound
and
paired
super
easily
with
my
cell
phone
the
magnetic
piece
helps
keep
them
around
my
neck
when
not
in
use
overall
great
buy
have
always
had
problems
with
pairing
these
paired
right
up
walked
pretty
far
away
without
realizing
and
never
lost
signal
they
also
fit
comfortably
in
my
ears
have
bought
so
many
bluetooth
earbuds,
some
well
over
yes
know,
they
go
much
higher
but
not
for
me
these
are
the
best
so
far
update:
customer
service
contacted
me
after
wrote
the
review
that
the
headphones
died
after
0mo
they
were
polite,
apologetic
and
offered
me
free
replacement
or
full
refund
this
is
excellent
customer
service
and
the
company
stands
behind
their
products
opted
to
get
replacement
which
arrived
promptly
and
is
working
wellused
while
running
on
the
treadmill,
once
week
on
average
sound
quality
was
good,
the
earphones
stayed
put
the
boltune
bluetooth
headphones
seem
to
be
of
excellent
quality
and
are
very
reasonably
priced
they
were
easy
to
pair
with
my
phone,
they
sound
great,
and
have
fine
battery
life
my
wife
and
liked
them
enough
that
we
bought
another
set
for
her
thanks
packaging:
overall
the
earphones
are
well
packaged
minimal,
hasslefree
packaging
and
easily
accessible
like
how
the
earphones
came
in
their
own
little
plastic
bag
and
the
earphones
them
selves
had
their
own
protective
covers
like
when
you
buy
new
phone
and
it
has
that
protective
plastic
on
the
screensound:
they
sound
good,
or
at
least
good
enough
can
see
myself
using
these
for
listening
to
lectures
at
the
gymbattery
life:
tbdcons:
did
struggle
bit
to
get
the
charging
port
open,
the
cover
is
tightly
in
there
and
the
lip
is
almost
none
existent
suppose
this
is
by
design,
but
for
daily
use
this
might
pose
slight
inconvenience
also,
plugging
in
the
usb
felt
little
awkwardoverall:
solid
earphones
the
boltune
bluetooth
headphones
have
great
battery
life,
and
good
sound
the
ease
of
set
up,
and
ease
of
use
in
my
daily
workout
routines
have
made
these
my
most
used
headphones
they
are
bit
heavy,
but
they
make
up
for
it
with
the
solid
battery
life
the
headhphones
charge
quickly
and
use
the
speakers
to
tell
you
when
they
are
turned
on
or
off
'power
on'
'
power
off'
via
speakers
while
pressing
center
button
i've
had
them
for
couple
months
and
they
are
still
working
great
thank
you
have
had
several
pairs
of
headphones
and
have
to
say
these
are
my
absolute
favorite
could
jump
around,
shake
my
head,
and
these
absolutely
stayed
in
place
the
sound
quality
is
excellent
in
comparison
to
the
other
headphones
that
had
pairing
to
the
phone
is
very
easy,
and
the
battery
life
has
been
good
so
far
we
will
see
how
these
hold
up
in
the
rain,
although
other
reviewer
have
said
that
the
device
is
sweat
proof
one
minor
irritation
is
that
the
charging
port
it
difficult
to
open,
but
think
this
will
improve
over
time
as
the
joint
opens
up
see
picture
just
got
my
third
pair
of
boltune
bluetooth
headphones
and
love
them
used
my
first
set
for
about
year
before
lost
them,
second
set
about
months
before
ran
over
them,
and
just
got
my
third
pair
cannot
tell
difference
in
the
quality
of
music
between
these
headphones
and
any
apple
headphones
have
ever
used
can
leave
them
powered
on
all
day
listening
to
music
on/off
without
having
to
charge
them
my
favorite
feature
however,
is
the
magnetic
clasps
that
click
together
like
necklace
so
you
never
have
to
take
them
off
the
range
is
also
perfect
and
never
have
any
spotty
connection
like
have
experienced
with
other
bluetooth
headphone
brands
initial
impression
is
very
good
tried
several
other
brands
and
they
have
all
been
0'd
due
to
sucking
these
are
good
right
out
of
the
box
easy
to
pair
and
turn
on
and
off
sound
quality
good
have
slightly
misshaped
ears
due
to
wrestling
and
these
fit
really
nicei
use
these
for
working
out
and
running
after
trying
few
different
sized
inserts
they
stay
in
place
reasonably
wellso
far
so
good
worked
great
for
the
first
few
months
great
sound
wouldnt
call
it
noise
cancelation
but
more
of
noise
isolation
since
the
design
just
seals
and
prevents
any
out
side
noise
never
really
used
them
that
much
but
lately
ive
been
getting
battery
low
after
hrs
use
so
maybe
the
battery
is
not
good
anymore
and
to
my
luck
the
return
period
is
over
have
had
these
headphones
for
almost
year
&
use
them
every
day
use
them
while
cutting
&
sanding
wood
although
can
still
hear
the
noise
it
is
reduced,
&
can
still
hear
what
listening
to
over
the
sound
of
the
saw
love
that
they
are
magnetic
too
cause
when
need
to
take
them
out
can
leave
them
draped
around
my
neck
for
easy
access
instead
of
them
sliding
had
pair
prior
to
these
that
weren
magnetic
&
one
side
got
caught
on
the
washing
machine
&
ripped
the
earphone
off
with
these
that
won
happen
&
can
listen
for
hours
without
having
to
charge
them
have
been
through
so
many
headphones,
earbuds,
etc
it's
getting
ridiculous
because
they
all
eventually
break
down,
some
much
sooner
than
others
the
high
quality
of
these
headphones
are
obvious
right
out
the
box
quality
materials,
very
durable
the
sound
is
great
for
the
price
my
favorites
about
this
one
are
the
very
long
battery
life,
wireless
bluetooth
capabilties,
it's
waterproof,
and
can
also
be
flipped
into
necklace
with
the
magnetic
tips
am
very
impressed
with
this
bluetooth
headset
received
on
time
the
packaging
was
nice
the
headset
is
exactly
as
described
it
comes
with
several
different
earbud
sizes
so
that
you
can
get
the
right
fit,
charging
cable,
and
nice
bag
to
carry
the
product
in,
and
easy
to
understand
instructionswithin
minutes
had
the
headset
connected
and
was
using
it
to
participate
in
conference
call
on
my
pc
and
everything
sounded
great
and
could
hear
me
perfectly
am
now
able
to
move
around
my
office
without
taking
my
headset
off
and
couldn't
be
happier
will
recommend
to
my
family
and
friends
find
that
the
power
unit
on
the
cord
is
too
close
to
the
ear
piece
when
try
to
put
it
up
with
my
hair
it
works
well
and
is
easy
to
use
the
buttons
like
the
ear
piece
and
find
it
is
very
comfortable
and
great
fit
for
noise
cancellation
these
are
very
nice
headphones
they
fit
snuggly
in
my
ears
and
have
very
good
sound
and
bass
to
them
like
the
fact
that
don't
have
cord
hanging
from
my
phone
which
was
always
getting
caught
on
things
and
ripping
out
of
my
ears
have
used
them
for
calls
and
everyone
has
been
able
to
hear
me
fine
as
can
hear
them
good
also
have
used
them
couple
hours
the
first
time
after
full
charge
and
over
hours
several
weeks
later
listening
to
music
and
it
still
shows
an
almost
full
battery
can
go
fairly
long
distance
from
my
phone
before
lose
reception
they
are
at
good
price
and
will
make
good
gifts
very
happy
with
these
been
using
these
headphones
at
work
almost
every
day
for
month,
never
had
battery
issue
once
i've
gotten
close
to
hours
of
use
without
charge,
but
expect
battery
life
to
degrade
over
time
sound
quality
is
good
for
the
price,
sound
deadening
is
also
good
gotta
say
was
skeptical
at
first
but
really
like
these
they
come
with
different
sizes
of
ear
pieces
to
help
get
the
best
fit
for
your
ear
type,
small
charging
cord
adaptor,
and
nice
bag
to
store
extras
in
the
backs
of
the
ear
buds
are
magbetic
so
you
can
wear
as
necklace
when
not
in
use
very
easy
to
use
and
worth
the
$$
have
purchased
few
sports
headphones
in
the
past
but
found
that
none
would
stay
in
my
ears
properly
because
sweat
lot
even
after
experimenting
with
different
insert
sizes
however
these
are
very
comfortable
and
stay
in
beautifully,
even
on
serious
bike
ride
where
move
lot
at
first
was
bit
skeptical
of
the
little
wings
because
they
are
flexible
expected
them
to
be
stiff
so
they
would
slot
into
the
curve
of
my
ear
but
it
turns
out
they
fit
great
and
adjust
to
my
ear
shape
and
they
sound
great
too
i've
had
chance
to
use
these
few
times,
and
they
do
quite
well
with
bluetooth
pairing,
noise
cancellation,
and
overall
sound
quality
unlike
some
other
bluetooth
headphones,
these
don't
have
buttons,
just
three
intuitive
ones
noise
cancellation
is
good
as
wellthe
biggest
downside
to
them
is
that
the
earbuds
themselves
are
bit
heavy
on
my
first
run
with
them,
they
were
constantly
bouncing
out
of
my
ears
that
was
pretty
easily
remedied
by
switching
to
the
larger
ear
canal
nubs,
as
well
as
the
larger
pieces
that
hug
the
inside
of
your
ear
they
now
sit
nice
and
tight,
and
as
bonus
do
an
even
better
job
blocking
out
sound
bluetooth
was
easy
to
pair
worked
great
battery
seems
to
last
while;
haven't
had
to
use
all
the
battery
in
one
go
yet
not
sure
about
the
noise
cancellation
part
the
structure
of
the
earbud
fits
in
your
ear
good
so
guess
that
kills
some
surrounding
noise,
but
it
doesn't
seem
to
have
some
sort
of
active
noise
cancellation,
or
maybe
just
didn't
notice
it
the
rear
of
the
earplug
is
magnetic
and
so
the
left
and
right
earplug
attaches
to
each
other
easier
for
storage
in
the
little
bag
provided
thy
should
improve
the
noise
cancelation
because
durig
phone
calls
the
receiver
kept
complaining
about
noises
and
sound
movement
which
was
very
annoying
although
the
sound
from
the
caller
was
clearbatterie
life
is
ok
although
after
one
call
the
following
day
it
became
0%i
also
faced
another
issue
was
connected
and
having
phone
call,
all
was
fine
until
hanged
up
and
received
another
call
the
sound
wouldnt
come
out
of
the
earphone
even
though
it
was
connected
after
several
failed
attempt
of
connecting
and
disconnecting
the
wireless
it
worked
only
when
restarted
my
mobile
am
pleased
with
these
they
don't
have
to
be
charged
all
the
time
long
battery
life
the
last
ones
bought
still
work
but,
something
is
up
with
them,
they
connect
and
disconnect
at
random
so
bought
another
pair
will
still
use
the
old
ones
at
home
and
the
new
ones
at
work
these
headphones
sound
and
feel
great
in
the
ear
was
blown
away
by
the
sound
quality
and
noise
cancellation
my
music
sounds
awesome
and
they
work
well
for
phone
calls
these
touch
the
inside
of
your
ear
to
stay
put
which
works
really
well
when
go
running
or
use
them
while
working
definitely
winner
waited
to
give
these
review
because
wanted
to
give
them
an
honest
review
these
are
great
they
have
great
sound
long
battery
life
they
sync
to
multiple
devices
to
my
phone
and
ipad
with
ease
and
so
glad
bought
them
highly
recommend
purchased
these
buds
several
months
ago,
and
unfortunately
broke
them
because
wear
them
to
bed,
contacted
the
customer
service
department
just
to
check
to
see
if
it
would
be
covered
under
their
warranty
even
though
the
damage
caused
was
basically
my
fault,
boltune
sent
me
new
pair
thank
you
sheryl
from
customer
service,
you
guys
definitely
went
above
and
beyond
promise
to
take
better
care
of
them
because
they
are
the
best
set
of
wireless
buds
have
ever
purchased
got
these
earbuds
around
christmas
to
replace
previous
pair
they
worked
very
well
for
about
months,
at
which
time
noticed
the
volume
was
incapable
of
exceeding
about
0%,
even
when
set
to
max
seem
to
have
talent
for
breaking
technology,
though,
so
can't
say
it
was
all
the
earbuds'
fault
overall,
these
earbuds
served
me
pretty
well,
and
i'd
probably
get
them
again
in
the
future
the
battery
life
was
excellent,
and
enjoyed
the
added
feature
of
noise
cancellation
bought
these
because
my
previous
pair
of
earbuds
different
brand
had
nasty
habit
of
cutting
in
and
out
my
husband
had
bought
these
previously
and
recommended
them
to
me
i'm
glad
he
did
clear
sound
quality
with
wide
listening
range
no
cutting
in
and
out
highly
recommended
have
been
able
to
use
these
all
day
on
phone
calls
and
listening
to
music
with
the
battery
lasting
at
least
hours
the
sound
quality
is
really
nice
and
has
good
bass
response
they
are
easy
to
use
as
there
are
only
three
buttons
excellent
for
the
money;
use
them
for
gps
usually
while
driving
an
ambulance
to
get
to
calls
and
back
to
hospitalsthey
cancel
noise
well;
well
enough
for
me
to
wear
them
in
lieu
of
ear
protection
while
shooting
handguns
outdoorslost
my
last
pair
on
call;if
anything
to
complain
about;
they
are
tiny
bit
bulky
it
should
an
excellent
product
especially
for
the
price
the
controls
are
nicely
available
in
switch
so
that
you
don
have
to
reach
up
to
your
ear
and
manage
the
controls
just
by
feel
pairs
nicely
have
not
used
it
enough
to
confirm
battery
life
but
the
performance
is
great
can't
also
vouch
for
the
features
that
have
not
used/tested
like
waterproof
but
definitely
recommendation
in
case
you
are
looking
for
good
pair
of
bluetooth
headset
it
is
great
for
the
price,
practical,
long
lasting
battery
life
the
only
thing,
for
my
preference,
is
the
length
is
somewhat
short
when
the
around
the
neck,
the
magnets
connect
at
about
my
clavicle
and
find
that
location
to
be
uncomfortable,
but
it
isn't
deal
break
it
didn't
think
of
it
at
the
time
of
buying
it
but
will
next
time
needed
good
bluetooth
headset
for
walking
and
for
work,
so
did
lot
of
looking
and
found
this
hidden
gem
as
soon
as
got
it
in
turned
it
on
with
no
problems
and
it
paired
with
my
phone
immediately
all
the
buttons
work
perfectly
and
the
sound
quality
is
amazing
if
you
need
good,
affordable
bluetooth
headset
this
is
for
you
these
earbuds
are
great
alternative
to
some
of
the
crazy
expensive
bluetooth
ones
out
there
overall,
these
are
great
deal
for
the
pricepros:
they
truly
are
noise
cancelling,
the
sound
quality
is
amazing,
they
are
attached
and
are
difficult
to
misplacecons:
the
attachment
sticking
out
of
some
of
the
ear
inserts
can
get
painful,
luckily
they
work
fine
without
that
extended
piece
also,
haven't
had
much
luck
with
the
microphone,
people
say
they
can't
hear
my
well
so
i'll
have
to
keep
messing
around
with
that
to
see
if
it
is
just
defect
some
others
said
their
mic
was
great
the
mids
in
these
headphones
are
super
muddy
it
sounds
like
im
listening
to
music
throughout
wall
i'm
and
have
used
many
many
different
types
of
headphonesas
the
saying
goesthis
ain't
iti'm
going
to
buy
another
pair
of
beatsxupdate:
they
sent
me
the
pro
version
and
pair
of
wireless
0's
the
pro
version
is
little
better,
but
the
0s
are
way
better
however,
their
battery
life
is
so
crazy
lackluster
if
you
want
to
go
between
the
pods
and
these,
get
these
but
the
pro
version
the
battery
life
alone
is
worth
itstill
muddy
mids
love
my
bose
headphones
and
they
are
great
but
was
looking
for
ear
plugs
for
my
travel
needs
which
take
less
space
and
at
the
same
time
have
features
similar
to
my
bose
browsed
and
compared
multiple
products
boltune
looked
like
good
choice
and
was
not
disappointed
am
using
these
for
last
days
now
excellent
product
noise
cancellation
in
too
crowded
spaces
like
railway
station
could
still
be
improved
but
0%
of
cases
it
gives
good
voice
call
experience
battery
life
is
more
than
hrs
that's
the
max
used
during
travel
before
recharging
am
going
to
use
it
more
often
now
in
remote
office
environment
also
these
can
be
charged
using
my
android
phone
car
charger
if
you
find
yourself
like
me
extending
weekend
trip
to
visit
family,
the
world
upends
itself,
and
you
get
stuck
with
your
parents
for
what
seems
like
it's
going
to
be
forever
then
you
need
these
headphones
they'd
be
good
even
if
the
world
as
we
know
it
wasn't
collapsing
the
packaging
is
thoughtful,
no
unnecessary
plastic
crap
that's
impossible
to
open
it
includes
lots
of
extras,
nice
pouch
and
multiple
buds
that
should
fit
anyone
thank
you
boltune
for
making
this
crazy
time
bit
more
enjoyable
with
awesome
sound
and
seemless
connectivity
have
bought
earphones
years
ago,
the
microphone
is
so
poor
so
decided
to
buy
new
one
after
long
time
research
finally
decide
to
buy
this
one
just
got
it
today,
it
has
not
disappointed
me
the
sound
is
very
good
in
this
price
the
bass
is
deep
the
middle
range
is
clear
the
microphone
is
good
much
better
than
the
one
owned
beforesuggestion:
prefer
to
have
the
foam
tips
because
it
will
not
suck
my
eardrumthe
only
drawback
to
this
earphones
is
the
background
noise
while
it
been
on
but
all
in
all
fell
ok
even
my
ear
is
very
sensitive
so
don
think
it
will
bother

america
ear:
am
constantly
wearing
headphoneswhile
am
exercising,
cleaning
up
around
the
house,
and
working
am
hard
on
my
headphonesover
the
last
five
years
regardless
of
cost
or
brand
have
had
to
replace
my
headphones
every
months
have
had
my
boltune
bluetooth
headphones
for
months
and
have
no
complaints
excellent
sound
and
battery
life
the
headphones
are
very
durable
and
have
successfully
withstood
the
my
daily
wear
and
tear
the
noise
cancelling
is
good
but
not
as
great
as
my
over
the
the
ear
stereo
headphones
because
they
are
also
an
excellent
price
recently
purchased
second
pair
highly
recommend
these
headphones
like
that
thee
come
with
different
sized
ear
buds
to
fit
your
ears
have
hard
time
finding
ear
buds
that
fit
and
these
fit
well
and
have
good
noise
cancellation
and
sound
quality
like
that
the
earbuds
are
magnetic
and
connect
into
necklace
so
you
don't
lose
your
earbuds
the
charge
time
was
fast
and
it
connects
smoothly
to
my
iphone
bought
these
for
working
out
and
yard
work
so
they
take
beating
usually
have
to
buy
new
pair
once
year
because
lose
them
thought
i'd
try
different
brand
this
time
like
these
better
the
ones
usually
get
because
the
the
charging
port
is
on
the
remote,
and
not
the
buds
also
didn't
realize
the
buds
were
magnetic
which
was
pretty
cool
they
aren't
quite
as
comfortable
as
those
last
ones
wear
these
in
the
yard
for
few
hours
think
the
difference
is
these
don't
have
the
over
the
ear
clip
overall,
good
set
of
cheap
earbuds
very
light
the
earbuds
stay
in
the
ear
really
well
and
the
sound
quality
is
excellent
use
these
while
running
and
while
there
is
slight
annoyance
that
the
volume
control
thing
creeps
in
front
of
me
instead
of
behind
my
head,
the
majority
of
the
time
0%
don't
even
know
that
i'm
wearing
anything
comfort
these
headphones
are
very
comfortable
the
earpieces
are
substantial
enough
to
give
good
fit,
but
not
so
bulky
as
to
leave
your
ears
tired
after
hours
of
usesound
certainly
above
average
for
earbuds
in
this
price
range
they're
not
superaudiophile,
but
for
$0
you
can't
complainpairing
while
pairing
is
simple
enough,
they
don't
"retain
their
pairing"
when
you
switch
to
another
device
bounce
back
and
forth
between
using
these
with
my
ipad
and
my
iphone,
and
have
to
reestablish
the
pairing
sometimes
when
switch
have
had
problems
with
most
earbuds
staying
in
my
ears
while
am
running
but
these
earbuds
stay
in
very
well
when
run
and
play
soccer
sometimes
the
wire
pulls
bit
on
the
back
of
my
neck
but
is
not
much
of
problem
they
connect
to
my
phone
quickly
and
do
not
have
problem
staying
connected
the
noise
cancelling
is
perfect
for
me
they
cancel
out
lot
of
distracting
noise
but
like
that
am
still
able
to
hear
when
people
try
to
talk
to
me
was
looking
for
bluetooth
headset
for
exercising
wanted
set
that
had
great
sound
quality
and
was
comfortable
in
my
ears
read
the
reviews
and
liked
what
saw
was
very
happy
when
got
them
they
charged
quick,
they
were
very
comfortable
in
my
ears,
and
the
sound
was
great
like
the
0hour
charge
can
use
them
for
work
and
still
have
enough
charge
to
exercise
with
them
at
the
end
of
the
day
also
like
the
microphone
and
controls
for
adjusting
the
volume
and
forwarding
song
when
paired
with
my
device
would
definitely
recommend
these
to
anyone
who
is
looking
for
bluetooth
headset
for
great
price
when
go
to
amazon
only
see
products
and
reviewsi
am
not
interested
in
buying
this
product,
but
because
saw
the
reviews
from
the
buyers
before
it
was
very
good
and
by
chance
the
product
that
used
was
almost
brokenfinally
was
curious
and
wanted
to
try
to
buy
this
product
tooi
am
waiting
for
this
product
to
reach
home,
when
this
product
arrives
at
my
homei
immediately
use
it
but
it
turns
out
this
product
is
really
good
very
much
in
accordance
with
the
reviews
of
previous
buyersi
also
feel
satisfied
and
happy
these
earbuds
were
great
while
they
lasted
i'm
careful
with
such
devices,
but
the
right
speaker
failed
suddenly
at
month
five
don't
know
if
these
would
withstand
any
sports
activityagain,
the
phones
were
great
while
they
lasted
sound,
noise
canceling,
play
time
especially
for
the
price
the
run
time
on
charge
is
fantastic
purchased
second
pair
with
the
hope
of
better
durability
was
bit
skeptical
when
decided
to
purchase
these
after
read
all
the
reviews
use
headphones
for
conference
calls
for
work
and
listen
to
music
through
out
the
day
the
fit
of
these
headphones
is
great,
little
heavy
but
the
little
fin
on
the
earbud
helps
at
least
for
me
really
like
how
they
magnet
to
each
other
when
you're
not
using
them,
especially
when
have
to
run
after
year
old
and
want
to
keep
them
around
my
neck
love
them
so
much
might
get
them
for
my
older
daughter
would
defiantly
buy
them
over
and
over
again
the
sound
sometimes
lagged
with
videos
and
connection
often
broke
if
you
covered
one
of
the
buds
have
long
hair,
so
when
let
my
hair
down,
it
falls
in
front
of
the
headphones
and
causes
connectivity
issues
the
biggest
problem
had
with
these
was
that
the
buds
were
very
heavy
my
ears
were
sore
after
hours
with
them
in
the
headphones
worked
okay
overall
wanted
to
like
these
headphones,
and
the
do
work
great
for
the
most
part
the
issues
come
in
when
they're
connected
to
computer
or
paired
with
multiple
devices
when
connected
to
the
computer
the
randomly
disconnect
or
power
off
this
happens
once
every
time
pair
to
the
computer
for
zoom
meeting
very
frustrating
if
you're
only
using
these
for
your
phone,
they
work
great
for
under
$0
i'm
so
impressed
with
these
headphones
have
small
ears
so
i'm
always
worried
about
them
staying
in
and
these
fit
perfectly
with
the
provided
smaller
earpieces
also
the
sound
quality
for
phone
calls
is
great,
i'm
very
happy
with
this
purchase
not
noise
cancelling,
noise
isolating,
and
knew
that
going
in
of
course
not
boselevel
sound
quality
but
then
didn
pay
for
that
work
great
for
me
as
wireless
headphones
for
my
computer
haven
really
tested
the
mic
for
quality
or
isolation
battery
life
seems
to
be
close
to
hours
but
have
not
actually
measured
that
like
them
would
buy
again
the
ear
pieces
are
little
different
and
take
while
to
get
used
to,
but
they
do
provide
excellent
fit
when
moving
around
or
working
these
are
solid
all
around
earbuds
for
the
price,
and
to
be
honest,
was
going
to
leave
star
review
anyway,
but
it
turns
out
got
ten
dollar
gift
card
for
leaving
this
review
lucky
me
received
my
bluetooth
headphones
few
weeks
ago
and
have
used
them
on
average
hours
each
day
since
they
are
amazing
they
pair
well,
the
battery
life
is
about
hours
and
yes
used
them
from
charge
to
recharge
and
they
last
that
long
in
minutes
of
charging,
after
the
battery
is
fully
discharged
you
will
get
hours
of
play
they
have
long
range
so
you
are
not
constantly
having
to
repair
when
you
move
long
distances
from
your
device
the
price
is
great
and
don
think
there
anything
in
this
price
range
that
comes
close
honestly
they
are
better
than
lot
of
higher
priced
headphones
ve
used
in
short
they
are
an
excellent
choice
tammy,
audio
book
fanatic
got
these
for
my
husband,
he
needed
them
for
handsfree
phonecalls
in
the
office
tried
them
with
my
son
and
the
microphone
transmits
just
as
good
as
regular
phone
call
sound
quality
was
amazingall
in
all,
he
loves
them
especially
at
this
price
if
your
looking
for
great
sound
quality
at
reasonable
price
look
no
further
than
these
headphonesit's
light
and
easy
to
setup
and
use
usually
have
it
connected
to
my
laptop
my
tablet
and
my
phone
all
at
the
same
time
and
the
speed
at
which
it
switches
amazes
me
everytimeafter
using
this
product
bought
more
for
my
family
and
everyone
loves
them
have
had
these
for
month
they
are
easy
to
turn
on
and
last
well
sound
quality
is
good
and
love
the
british
accent
for
on
and
off
find
them
really
comfortable
too
the
cord
was
little
stiff
at
first
but
it
is
loosening
up
great
product
purchased
these
for
my
husband
who
spends
good
portion
of
his
day
on
the
phone
with
clients,
and
constantly
loses
or
breaks
his
earbuds
these
are
the
same
design
and
have
just
as
clear
sound
as
the
$0
earbuds
bought
him,
which
broke
within
year
he
likes
that
he
can
keep
them
with
him
without
having
to
keep
them
in
his
ears
all
the
time
just
as
good
as
his
last
pair
for
fraction
of
the
price
great
purchase
at
first
every
thing
was
good
but
after
sweat
or
the
microphone
that
picked
ur
voice
did
not
work
most
of
the
time
so
returned
it
no
prob
and
the
same
thing
happened
with
the
new
one
and
it
stopped
turning
on
but
would
still
charge
read
reviews
of
several
bluetooth
headphones
before
purchasing
this
one
did
not
write
review
until
now
when
acknowledge
it
has
good
sound
quality
connect
it
to
my
fitbit
versa
and
listen
to
my
most
loved
songs
did
not
have
to
spend
hundred
dollars
for
good
one
thank
you
these
are
by
far
the
best
bluetooth
earbuds
have
ever
purchased
they
are
extremely
high
quality
and
the
battery
life
on
them
is
unreal
sound
is
perfect
and
they
come
in
small
mesh
case
for
easy
transportation
no
flaws
and
would
highly
recommend
easy
to
set
up
and
use,
but
despite
all
of
the
choices
provided,
the
ear
buds
don't
stay
in
during
heavy
exercise
they
don't
seem
to
do
much
noise
cancelling

updatethis
seller
will
not
stop
harassing
me
to
change
my
review
reported
to
amazon
and
they're
still
contacting
me
so
frustrated
no
do
not
accept
your
offer
of
replacement
of
your
crappy
item
&
$0
paypal
no
thanks
little
earphone
comes
with
big
sound
equally
distributed
between
bass,
medium
and
high
ranges
with
added
fittings
brings
more
selections
of
comfort
and
stability
oh,
forgot
the
great
price
that
you
can't
beat
considering
the
quality
you
can
only
see
in
high
ends
with
much
higher
price
great
selection
and
truly
good
music/sound
with
freedom
to
move
and
enjoy
longer
playing
times
thanks
really
wasn
expecting
the
earbuds
to
be
so
comfortable
or
to
sound
so
good
but
was
surprised
the
comfort
level
is
amazing
you
could
forget
they
were
there
tried
hard
to
make
them
fall
out
but
they
stayed
put
the
sound
is
excellent,
nice
bass
and
very
clear
was
trying
them
out
while
watching
tv
and
the
noise
canceling
feature
works
well
didn
take
long
to
charge
and
they
seem
to
last
am
so
pleased
with
my
purchase
thus
far
like
these
headphones
have
had
them
for
week
now
it
is
little
preliminary
to
evaluate
the
battery
life
but
it
has
been
satisfactory;
haven't
run
them
down
all
the
way
in
single
day
yet
have
noticed
few
minor
quirks
with
this
particular
item
one
thing
find
little
irritating
is
that
when
one
ear
plug
is
in
the
ear
the
rest
of
the
device
will
tend
to
slip
off
your
neck;
you
really
have
to
use
both
earphones
simultaneously
moreover,
when
the
two
earphones
are
magnetized
around
your
neck
they
can
protrude
out
bit
rather
than
lying
flush
with
your
shirt
set
up
was
simple
and
quick
use
this
item
in
the
garage
to
listen
to
music
and
videos
paired
with
phone
and
different
tablets
easy
great
sound
for
the
cost
have
charged
them
once
used
for
several
hours
without
recharging
would
buy
again
have
had
other
more
expensive
ones
and
they
couldn't
come
close
to
these
work
hour
shift
and
these
actually
made
it
all
the
way
through
the
day
and
wanted
to
see
how
far
into
the
next
day
they
would
go,
was
so
surprised
that
they
made
it
completely
through
day
they
still
said
they
had
0%
battery
left
work
around
lot
of
loud
machines
and
these
cancel
the
noise
out
pretty
well
really
like
these
and
would
recommend
them
was
very
surprised
by
the
quality
of
these
considering
the
low
price
ve
been
using
these
for
almost
two
months
with
no
issues
battery
life
is
very
strong
and
the
sound
quality
is
great
these
hook
up
with
no
issues
to
my
peloton
and
iphone
need
new
headphones
after
my
original
pair
stopped
connecting
via
bluetooth,
and
pick
these
up
after
couple
hours
of
wear,
love
them
the
fit
is
excellent
and
the
noise
cancellation
is
excellent
the
only
thing
did
not
like
upon
first
listen
was
thought
they
were
bit
tinny
however,
that
faded
over
time
and
also
changed
the
earbuds
to
smaller
size
so
they
fit
better
wasn't
expecting
much
from
$0
bluetooth
headphones
was
mistaken
wear
them
all
day
at
work
the
sound
was
fantastic
the
fit
was
almost
perfect
when
not
in
ears,
like
the
convenience,
they
stay
safely
around
your
neck
with
the
magnets
to
hold
them
together
they
provided
true
stereo
with
good
base
and
background
noise
was
not
noticable
connecting
them
was
easy
and
with
little
getting
used
to,
managing
the
the
small
volume
control
is
easy
over
all
am
impressed
have
now
worn
these
ear
buds
hours
day
am
still
completely
impressed
that
such
inexpensive
earbuds
can
work
as
good
as
the
expensive
ones
will
recommond
these
to
my
friends
had
to
return
it,
sound
quality
was
great
but
it
did
not
work
as
like
when
making
calls
the
person
receiving
the
call
would
complain
about
not
hearing
anything
every
time
would
stop
talking
other
than
that,
sound
was
great
and
battery
would
last
long
time
have
purchased
several
headphones
&
earbudsbut
these
are
the
best
by
far
there
lightweight
&
fit
greatdon't
start
to
feel
heavy
after
extended
use
sound
quality
is
much
better
then
expected
&
can't
beat
the
hrs
of
playtime
def
recommend
;
bought
this
product
at
the
beginning
of
december
and
was
really
happy
it
worked
well
and
playtime
was
really
long
but
at
the
end
of
april
it
stopped
working
cannot
charge
it
anymore
very
disappointing
because
this
headphones
gave
me
long
playtime
that
was
what
was
looking
for
bought
these
as
gift
for
my
wife
since
her
other
pair
broke
she
loves
them
they
were
much
easier
to
sync
with
her
devices,
the
sound
quality
is
great,
and
they
come
with
different
sized
ear
buds
to
choose
from
highly
recommend
this
is
the
second
pair
of
these
headphones
i've
purchased
purchased
pair
for
myself
and
loved
them
so
much
that
bought
my
husband
pair
they
truly
last
for
hour
and
they
have
great
sound
highly
recommend
these
headphones
lost
my
airpods
case
so
needed
something
quickly
lol
so
used
it
for
almost
like
month
already,
and
should
say
love
it
love
my
airpods
of
course
it's
apple
but
this
one
is
0/0
of
what
airpods
cost
me
and
it
works
great
only
use
these
when
i'm
commuting
and
working
out
because
that's
when
almost
always
lose
my
airpods
because
these
are
connected
won't
lose
them
haven't
yet
and
it
lasts
for
long
time
and
the
quality
music
is
super
good,
for
the
price
the
price
is
what
nothing
can
beat
this
item
they
are
stable,
they
last
for
long
long
time,
noise
cancellation
is
pretty
good
too
am
just
really
excited
guess
loved
the
color
and
the
design,
plus
the
magnets
are
just
the
right
amount
of
strong
however,
the
cable
is
little
short
if
you
are
wearing
scarf
or
closed
neck
jacket
and
they
end
up
pulling
on
each
other
bit
also,
the
shape
of
the
earbuds
make
it
so
they
will
slip
out
relatively
easily,
this
could
be
plus
so
they
don't
get
damaged
is
they
get
snagged
on
something
but
they
can
feel
like
they
will
fall
out
at
some
point
already
own
pair
of
airpods,
but
connectivity
was
bad,
and
the
battery
doesn
last
long
wanted
something
waterproof
headphones
that
could
also
last
longsetup
was
super
easy
connection
was
very
good
sound
quality
was
very
good
battery
haven't
had
chance
to
see
if
there's
really
hours
of
battery
life,
but
ve
used
it
for
more
than
hr
it
works
with
iphone
and
samsung
really
like
the
"wired"
wireless
headphones
over
the
individual
buds
these
are
easier
to
find
and
harder
to
lose
wanted
something
for
snowboarding
and
mtn
biking
that
was
low
profile
and
had
buttons
for
skipping
tracks
and
volume
also
think
people
look
silly
slapping
their
ears
to
do
what
the
buttons
do
for
the
price
these
are
perfect
only
thing
i'd
like
to
see
come
with
the
product
is
little
alligator
clip
for
my
shirt
don't
always
ride
with
both
ears
in
need
to
be
able
to
hear
traffic
around
me
in
streets
and
slopes
liked
them
so
much
bought
them
twice
so
days
after
got
these
my
new
dog
destroyed
them
but
immediately
bought
another
pair
have
had
wireless
earbuds
but
because
they
we
just
the
buds
had
to
talk
louder
to
be
heard,
which
can't
do
at
work
the
mic
is
close
to
my
mouth
on
this
one
which
is
great
total
noise
cancellation
to
the
point
my
family
makes
fun
of
me
when
have
them
on
cause
they
know
can't
hear
them
rarely
have
to
chanrge
them
and
they
actually
pick
up
when
am
in
the
adjacent
building
next
door
love
the
little
carry
pouch
too
know
what
you're
thinking
the
right
headphones
are
status
symbol
when
you're
rocking
the
airpods,
people
know
you're
playafor
$0,
these
headphones
can't
be
beat
sound
quality,
battery
life,
noise
isolation
not
active
noise
cancellation
prefer
the
wired
headphones
with
magnet
like
this,
so
can
quickly
take
them
off
and
hang
them
around
my
neck
when
someone
decides
to
interrupt
my
jamimage
is
overrated
quality
for
good
price
is
where
it's
at
worked
great
the
first
time
used
them
then
they
don
turn
on
after
that
tried
to
charge
them
for
hours
and
troubleshoot
them
using
google
but
they
are
dead
they
feel
cheap
too
this
is
my
second
pair
of
this
style
of
headphones
and
my
first
pay
is
legitimately
better
quality
even
though
they
are
supposed
to
be
the
same
overall,
really
like
this
products
no
complaints
previously
was
using
the
standard
apple
headphones,
and
these
are
big
improvement
no
wires
=
way
less
cumbersome
and
my
apple
headphone
jack
kept
breaking
noise
cancelling
is
excellent
way
better
price
point
than
apple
ear
budsi'm
not
sound
expert,
and
i've
never
had
apple
air
pods,
but
would
guess
that
these
headphones
achieve
0%
of
the
sound
quality
at
~0%
of
the
price
these
are
great
wireless
headphones
ve
paid
triple
the
price
for
fraction
of
the
quality
in
the
past
the
sound
is
great
and
the
battery
life
has
been
fantastic
will
definitely
buy
more
as
needed
thanks
actually
like
these
earbuds
better
than
taotronics
that
had
bought
because
this
lets
you
pause,
skip,
and
backtrack
as
well
as
increase/decrease
the
volume
which
the
taotronic
does
as
wellthese
are
also
slightly
magnetic,
so
they
clasp
together
when
hanging
around
your
neck
this
prevents
them
from
accidentally
falling
off
your
body
when
you
re
not
using
the
headphonesthey
have
little
humming
sound
when
you
put
the
earbuds
in
with
no
music
playing
but
that
disappears
as
soon
as
the
music
starts
so
not
nuisance
in
my
opinion
loved
the
packaging
of
this
item
box
has
of
course
the
earphones,
pack
of
different
size
ear
tips
inch
micro
usb
would
love
it
if
was
little
longer
very
high
quality
pouch
and
manuals
love
how
these
earphones
have
flat
thick
cable
and
are
tangle
free
eartips
stay
in
ear
and
snug
fit
paired
with
my
iphone
in
or
less
seconds
played
cd
quality
audio
and
my
goodness
cannot
believe
how
good
it
sounded
the
sound
was
clear
with
no
muffle
or
distortion
have
not
tested
full
battery
life
but
seeing
other
star
reviews
makes
me
hopeful
of
very
good
battery
life
no
need
to
purchase
those
$0+
earphones
ok,
so
first
off,
the
battery
life
is
absolutely
amazing
that's
huge
plus
these
headphones
are
great,
albeit
little
big/heavy
for
small
ears
like
teenagers
for
example
other
than
that,
with
little
moving
back
and
forth
until
you
adjust
it
correctly,
they
don't
budge
it
takes
few
times
to
get
the
hang
of
it
but
it's
smooth
after
that
so,
little
big
for
small
ears
but
perfect
for
everyone
else
highly
don't
you
can
find
anything
this
good
for
the
same
price
easy
to
link
to
my
ipad,
iphone
&
echo
ear
pieces
fit
well
and
stay
in
place
while
working
in
the
yard
or
walking
the
sound
is
clear
when
listening
to
my
audible
book
or
music
use
my
headphones
to
block
out
the
noise
of
my
power
equipment;
these
do
nice
job
for
hearing
protection
while
still
allowing
me
to
hear
someone
calling
me
or
car
coming
up
behind
me
have
been
exposed
to
snow
and
sleet
and
are
still
working
great
battery
charge
allows
for
full
days
use
would
buy
again
solid
packaging
light,
loud,
sweet
sound
good
base
but
only
lasted
months
with
weird
lights,
not
turning
off,
not
turning
on,
lost
volume
control
treated
them
well,
so
no
excuse
update:
fantastic
customer
service
and
they
made
it
right
bought
another
pair
like
these
headphones
lot
they
are
super
easy
to
set
up,
and
easy
to
use
just
couple
of
buttons
like
the
magnetic
clasp
so
don't
worry
about
loosing
them
when
not
in
use
the
sound
quality
to
me
seems
fine,
and
they
are
comfy
and
secure
in
my
ear
i'd
buy
them
again
had
purchased
few
soundbuds
slim
and
loved
those
they
aren't
super
durable
but
they
are
light
and
comfortable
initially
liked
these
but
they
were
slightly
heavy
for
me
the
company
stands
behind
their
products
and
made
me
satisfied
customer
bought
these
headphones
as
they
are
excellent
for
when
i'm
working
in
the
yard
they
keep
the
noise
of
powertools
out
of
my
years
and
the
tunes
in
them
also
appreciate
that
they're
water
resistant
had
numerous
bt
magnetic
headsets
and
use
primarily
when
driving
and
on
my
motorcycle
these
sound
very
goodsolid
bass
and
quality
sound
have
had
0+
conversations
while
on
the
headset
and
have
had
not
to
repeat
myself
once
yet
time
will
tell
on
the
quality,
etc
but
thus
far
they
are
pretty
good
product
sounds
decent
and
fits
well
the
battery
is
substantial
so
far
but
the
real
test
comes
with
age
the
drivers
stick
out
bit
too
far
for
me
and
they
have
some
weight
to
them
it
is
mostly
inconvenient
for
using
them
at
night
but
the
driver
sticking
out
hasn't
been
problem
for
running
so
far
these
block
out
noise
pretty
well
but
you
may
need
to
go
to
their
step
up
for
better
noise
isolation
on
the
microphoneoverall
would
recommend
these
headphones
these
headphones
fit
very
comfortably,
and
have
three
size
options
for
customization
if
needed
sound
quality
is
clear
and
crisp
across
the
low
to
hi
spectrum,
and
audio
for
calls
is
great
on
bothincoming
and
outgoing
ends
the
bluetooth
mechanism
is
small
and
nondescript,
which
is
great
for
the
gym,
as
there
won't
be
any
bulky
control
box
bumping
around
overall
nice
pair
of
headphones
well
worth
it
this
is
the
second
time
i've
purchased
these
earbuds
i'm
very
impressed
with
the
sound
quality
and
battery
life
the
only
reason
why
had
to
buy
second
pair
was
because
lost
the
first
pair,
in
my
house,
and
because
they
shut
off
after
minutes
of
inactivity
can't
find
them
anywhere
right
off
the
bat
packaging
great
all
the
pieces
are
of
great
high
quality
love
the
sound
the
bag
you
store
them
in
will
definitely
buy
for
gifts
great
for
hiit
workouts
and
jogging
doing
chores
around
the
house
crime
junkie
approved
it's
going
to
be
hard
to
beat
the
value
presented
by
the
headphones
at
this
price
they
work
seamlessly
and
have
very
long
battery
life
sound
quality
is
pretty
good
headphones
are
bit
bulkier
than
hoped
for,
but
they
are
such
good
value
for
the
price
be
sure
to
try
the
different
sizes
they
include
i'm
very
satisfied
with
my
purchase
and
would
recommend
them
if
you
are
looking
for
budget
bluetooth
headphones
wow
pleasantly
surprised
with
how
good
these
earbuds
are
was
almost
going
to
spend
$0
on
another
brand
earbuds
these
are
so
perfect,
the
sound
is
amazing
they
don
fall
out
my
ears
easily
and
can
work
out
and
drown
out
the
chaos
around
me
thank
you
finding
headphones
that
will
stay
in
my
ears,
while
running
and
golfing
not
at
the
same
time
,
has
been
challenge
these
seem
perfect
the
largest
of
the
choices
of
ear
adapters
are
so
soft,
comfortable,
and
snugwalking
yards
away
from
the
phone
still
holds
the
connection
with
no
drop
am
really
impressed
with
these
headphones
both
the
sound
quality
and
the
battery
life
are
excellent
love
the
rich
bass
these
headphones
offer
and
they
gonplenty
loud
also
have
smallish
ears
and
founfld
the
fit
with
the
smallest
ear
fittings
to
be
great
purchased
these
earbuds
for
myself
this
is
the
first
time
that
ve
owned
pair
of
bluetooth
earbuds
was
seeking
product
that
would
give
me
battery
life,
sound
quality,
design,
&
range
this
product
exceeded
all
of
these
expectations
was
most
impressed
with
the
battery
my
only
recommendation
would
involve
more
length
on
the
mic
wear
it
behind
my
neck
at
work
and
this
puts
the
mic
about
higher
than
prefer
don
have
that
issue
wearing
it
in
front
of
my
neck
outside
of
work
it
just
my
preference
to
wear
the
cord
away
from
my
neck
outside
of
that
issue,
the
product
gets
my
stamp
of
approval
what
great
about
these
headphones
are
the
sound
quality,
durability,
battery
life
and
how
light
weight
they
are
ve
used
these
for
long
runs,
and
casually
listening
to
music
while
doing
household
chores
they
also
fit
nice
and
snug
in
my
ears
without
any
issues
and
one
of
my
favorite
features
is
the
ear
buds
have
magnets
so
if
they
are
hanging
around
my
neck,
can
stick
the
earbuds
together
and
they
stay
in
place
this
is
my
second
ipx0
bought
the
first
pair
for
my
wife
and
she
is
absolutely
happy
with
them
this
pair
is
mine
hope
the
sound
is
very
good,
it
charges
fast
and
full
charge
lasts
for
day
design
is
also
very
friendly
the
price
looks
like
within
reasonable
range
what
else
would
anyone
want
from
earbudsupdate:
bluetooth
stopped
working
after
five
days
to
resume,
there
is
0%
chance
to
get
good
earbuds
and
0%
chance
to
get
defective
item
best
headset
have
bought
so
far
and
have
been
thru
many
in
the
$0
range
one
thing
that
they
are
way
better
at
is
call
quality
also
really
like
that
they
magnet
together
so
they
don't
fall
off
your
neck
highly
recommend
although
this
is
not
as
high
quality
as
say,
set
of
bose,
for
the
money
you
won't
be
disappointed
just
ordered
these
for
my
wife
and
she
loves
them
good
sound
quality,
nice
battery
life
and
comfortable
to
wear
bought
these
to
replace
pair
of
over
the
ear
headphones
and
set
of
skullcandy
headphonesi
was
floored
by
the
sound
quality,
the
magnetic
ends
are
the
best
thing
ever
have
tendency
to
leave
stuff
or
drop
it
the
fit
like
necklace
and
our
out
of
the
way
half
the
time
forget
am
wearing
them
around
my
neckthe
only
bad
thing
is
that
they
were
recently
stolen
so
am
going
to
buy
pairs
this
time
i'm
always
wearing
headphones
at
work
and
the
cord
can
be
bit
cumbersome,
so
ordered
these
to
give
me
more
freedom
the
sound
is
wonderful,
connection
was
super
duper
easy
and
they
are
comfortable
to
wear
the
carrying
case
they
come
with
is
small
and
convenient
it
holds
the
charging
cable
and
extra
little
earbud
covers
in
various
sizes
to
help
you
get
perfect
fit
these
are
very
nice
looking
earbuds
the
cord
between
them
doesn't
feel
flimsy
the
sound
is
clear
and
like
the
bass
not
too
much
and
not
too
little
the
magnets
on
the
earbuds
are
great
when
you
take
them
out
of
your
ears
at
work
so
you
don
lose
them
you
can
customize
the
fit
as
well,
there
are
sizes
overall
am
very
happy
and
the
price
is
great
these
are
excellent
earbuds,
at
great
price
they
are
superior
to
jbl
and
sennheiser
models,
in
terms
of
sound
quality
and
comfort,
but
the
boltune
model
is
about
half
the
price
construction
is
sturdy
sound
is
balanced
and
clear,
with
good
treble
and
base,
and
fit
keeps
ambient
noise
out,
but
remains
comfortable
the
magnetic
feature
is
very
handy
the
bluetooth
worked
well
and
paired
without
difficulty
have
not
used
them
enough
yet
to
be
able
to
comment
on
battery
life
was
going
to
buy
another
pair
of
anker
soundbuds
slim
and
decided
to
try
these
instead
because
of
the
good
ratings
and
similar
price
point
i'm
glad
did
they
are
comfortable,
have
good
sound
quality
for
an
inexpensive
pair
of
headphones,
and
pairing
was
breeze
the
bass
seems
more
pronounced
than
my
soundbud
slimsi
haven't
had
them
long
enough
to
be
able
to
comment
on
the
battery
life,
but
they
came
fully
charged
and
have
been
listening
to
them
for
hours
these
earbuds
are
great
they
are
very
reasonably
priced
got
great
sound,
excellent
battery
life
and
they
seem
to
be
quality
made
the
only
issue
have
is
that
you
can't
really
lay
on
your
side
with
them
in
because
the
stick
out
bit
too
much
they
are
really
comfortable
to
wear
also
the
buds
stick
together
by
magnetism
so
the
don't
get
tangled
as
easily
with
other
wires
that's
big
plus
would
recommend
them
to
friend
if
most
wireless
earbuds
don't
fit
you
then
these
are
you're
earbuds
plus
they
are
wireless
and
hold
long
battery
life
they
even
hold
in
my
ears
when
run
returned
another
pair
just
bought
because
they
really
didn't
fit
right
am
happy
with
this
purchase
and
they
give
you
little
bag
to
keep
everything
in
bought
pair
of
name
brand
rhymes
with
pony
bluetooth
sport
earbuds
similarly
priced
that
ended
up
returning
which
were
no
where
near
as
good
as
these
boltunes
the
call
quality
is
above
par
callers
on
the
other
end
say
they
don't
hear
any
background
noise
even
with
fan
and
tv
on
low
the
sound
quality
when
listening
to
music
is
great
the
bass
is
so
good
probably
because
of
the
larger
drivers
but
be
careful
too
loud
and
it
gets
little
muddy,
depends
on
the
type
of
music
the
magnets
that
hold
them
together
are
extra
strong
lost
my
old
pair
because
they
didn't
have
any
magnets
i'm
sure
won't
be
losing
these
sound
clarity
is
great,
noise
cancelling
is
better
than
expected
have
enjoyed
these
so
much
recently
purchased
another
pair
and
the
magnetic
"closure"
around
the
neck
prevents
me
from
losing
them
while
walking
around
an
all
around
win
have
had
the
brand
name
ear
buds
and
they
are
no
better
than
these
baby's
what
like
best
is
they
charge
via
usb
same
as
my
phone
and
smart
watch
so
only
need
that
wire
my
other
earbuds
and
headphones
use
usb
mini
which
is
annoying
to
pack
two
cablesthey
are
light
comfortable
and
have
intricate
touch/gesture
controls
so
you
can
bring
theses
to
the
gym
or
for
your
commute
it
really
shines
as
head
set
for
taking
and
making
calls
was
really
impressed
by
these
because
they
lasted
longer
on
partial
charge
than
my
phone
did
on
full
charge
the
little
rubber
bits
actually
fit
in
my
ears,
which
is
the
first
time
i've
ever
had
that
happen
because
my
ears
are
shaped
weird
guess
so
those
bits
never
fit
me
they
charged
pretty
quickly,
too
this
is
my
second
pair
of
boltune
bluetooth
earbuds
one
is
for
the
gym
and
the
motorcycle
and
one
for
the
ipad
and
garden
work
battery
is
great
and
sound
is
surprisingly
good
that
is
why
bought
another
one
thanks
these
are
great
sound
is
good,
battery
life
is
good
have
owned
others
like
this,
butwith
this
brand
the
wiring
is
little
thicker
for
increased
durability
my
other
brand
of
wireless
headphones
eventually
broke
due
to
wiring
issues
do
not
see
the
same
thing
happening
to
these
would
buy
this
brand
again
ve
been
using
these
headphones
for
week
and
so
far,
so
good
have
small
ears
which
cause
most
earbuds
to
pop
out,
but
these
stay
firmly
in
place
comfortably
the
battery
life
and
noise
cancellation
is
as
claimed
overall,
great
purchase
these
boltune
headphones
are
supreme
quality
they
are
exactly
what
was
looking
for
they
don
fall
out
of
my
ears,
the
sound
is
outstanding,
and
the
battery
life
is
excellent
can
use
them
for
days
several
hours
day
on
single
charge
use
them
while
work
to
listen
to
netflix
and
they
cancel
out
all
the
other
noise
around
me
you
will
not
be
disappointed
with
your
purchase
the
headphones
arrived
in
minimal
packaging
which
is
nice
for
recycling
the
sound
quality
is
better
than
my
plug
in
headphones
and
my
voice
is
clear
when
using
the
mic
they
come
with
multiple
size
ear
plugs
which
is
nice
to
get
the
perfect
fit
my
wife
loves
this
pair
of
wireless
earphones
she
has
completed
lot
of
audiobooks
while
cooking
with
those
earphones
the
product
is
great
in
sound
quality,
durability,
and
battery
life
thanks
lot
for
the
great
earphones
just
got
these
and
so
far
am
very
pleased
the
sound
is
good,
setup
was
super
easy
and
like
the
magnets
that
hold
them
together
around
your
neck
when
you
are
not
wearing
listened
using
them
on
my
run
this
am
and
battery
life
is
good
so
far
plan
to
get
second
pair
the
product
is
surprisingly
compact
wonder
where
they
fit
in
the
battery
and
bluetooth
maybe
because
of
this
the
sound
is
just
good
enough
it
wear
while
sleeping
and
walking
and
it's
super
light
mic
is
very
bad
if
for
excerise,
will
definitely
recommend
for
the
price
would
say
star
am
still
surprised
by
the
size
and
weight
extremely
well
built
really
satisfied
with
these
headphones
sound
quality
is
clear
and
dynamic
they
hold
up
well
during
busy
work
day
running
around
and
don't
fall
out
plus
sweat
isn't
an
issue
the
pairing
process
was
easy
and
they
reconnect
without
hassle
the
buttons
are
responsive
and
don't
have
any
problems
with
sticking
overall
really
happy
and
can
recommend
them
to
anyone
tried
pairs
before
found
these
the
others
either
fell
out
of
my
ears
often
or
they
had
an
arm
that
spooned
my
ear
which
interferes
with
my
mask
,
or
they
were
wired
and
couldn
get
feet
away
from
my
phone,
or
the
battery
didn
last
the
entire
work
day
have
none
of
theses
issues
with
this
set
of
earbuds
my
only
complaint,
which
isn
really
complaint
of
mine
but
those
around
me
the
noise
cancellation
is
so
good,
have
to
remove
them
from
my
ears
to
hear
my
coworkers
talking
to
me
had
these
for
month
and
they
burned
up
and
melted
when
was
charging
them
it
too
late
for
me
to
return
them
it
was
complete
waste
would
like
to
contact
the
company
for
replacementi
contacted
the
company
and
they
replaced
my
headphones
no
questions
asked
they
even
gave
me
options
for
replacement
and
shipped
priority
mail
love
them
they
work
great
think
this
happened
because
was
using
the
wrong
adapter
to
charge
them
for
these
you
need
0v/0a
charger
these
are
really
nice
battery
lasts
all
day
listening
to
audible,
podcasts,
and
using
the
phone
also
use
them
when
shoot
guns
for
noise
cancellation
when
they
are
completely
turned
off
rough
on
headphones,
these
are
durable
great
price,
highly
recommend
have
had
several
sets
of
bluetooth
headphones
and
these
are
by
far
the
best
have
had
them
for
months
and
they
are
still
working
great
the
sound
is
good
thing
like
best
is
the
strong
magnets
that
hold
them
together
when
they
are
around
my
neck
the
magnets
on
other
brand
had
were
weak
and
lost
them
not
too
long
after
got
them
the
battery
life
on
these
is
great
and
like
that
the
voice
that
tells
you
that
the
power
is
on
or
off
isn't
too
loud
if
these
ever
wear
our,
would
definitely
buy
them
again
easy
to
set
up
easy,
surprisingly
comfortable
fit
easy
to
listen
to
captures
the
whole
sound
as
listen
to
john
batiste
"jazz
in
america"
on
you
tube
great
gift
from
my
wife
for
christmas
this
is
an
excellent
product
for
the
price
great
sound
quality
and
comfortable
to
wear
have
smaller
ears
where
regular
airpods
unbearable
after
0mins
can
wear
these
for
hours
with
no
issues
highly
recommend
hi
am
runner
and
love
listening
to
music
without
the
hassle
of
long
cables
and
low
sound
quality
when
got
these
headphones
was
shocked
was
not
expecting
this
high
quality,
especially
at
low
level
say
that
in
the
best
way
can
they
feel
very
good
and
stay
in
your
ears
without
pain
and
do
such
good
job
to
cancel
the
noise
as
the
pandemic
is
going
on
have
not
tested
these
while
running
but,
being
at
home
and
having
only
one
in
the
ear
does
not
affect
the
opposite
side
to
fall
out
that
makes
me
really
enjoy
them
thank
youthe
mic
stopped
working
really
like
these
bluetooth
earbuds
very
easy
to
pair,
and
they
sound
great
just
what
need
for
the
cycling
studio
i'm
setting
up
during
this
virus
apocalypse
took
off
one
star
because
the
cord
is
bit
short
for
my
fat
neck
and
when
wear
them
around
my
neck,
clicked
together,
they
look
like
choker
on
me
:
i've
used
variety
of
different
bluetooth
headphones
similar
to
this,
but
this
boltune
model
seems
to
be
the
best
bet
overall
use
it
mainly
for
working
out,
but
also
sometimes
just
around
the
house
battery
life
is
excellent,
by
far
the
best
in
this
price
range
that
i've
found
sound
quality
is
good
as
well
the
headphones
are
lightweight
and
stay
in
my
ears
while
i'm
working
out,
and
are
definitely
sweat
resistant
at
this
price
point,
don't
think
they
can
be
beaten,
and
they're
definitely
worth
trying
out
these
headphones
are
wonderful
had
pair
of
headphones
that
were
wireless
and
didn
like
them
at
all
for
running
these
are
perfect
for
running
the
sound
is
great
and
super
easy
to
connect
these
are
wonderful
my
kids
have
been
using
them
too
they
come
with
smaller
ear
pieces
too
went
through
at
least
similar
blue
tooth
devices
they
all
tend
to
have
thin
sound
when
tried
this
boltune
device,
was
surprised
by
its
full
sound,
especially
the
bass
was
rich
without
being
distorted
am
very
happy
with
my
purchase
thank
you,
boltune
for
great
product
awesome
pair
of
headphones
actually
bought
these
to
replace
another
repair
of
bluetooth
headphones
and
these
are
by
far
are
way
better
the
sound
is
amazing
for
listening
to
music
and
calls
also
love
the
different
sizes
of
earbuds
you
get
with
it
would
deff
recommend
these
this
is
my
second
pair
of
these,
my
first
pair
were
swiped
by
my
sister
and
after
hers
broke
the
sound
is
amazing,
they
are
comfortable
and
the
magnetic
pieces
to
hold
it
together
when
not
in
use
is
amazing
use
to
have
the
lg
sports
headphones
which
don't
have
as
long
of
battery
life,
don't
sound
as
clear,
and
we're
more
expensive
so
feel
like
hit
gold
mine
with
these
this
is
nice
item
for
$0
the
sound
quality
is
good,
they
are
comfortable,
the
controls
are
basic
and
clear
it
quickly
reconnects
to
my
iphone
better
than
my
previous
set,
sensothe
magnets
on
the
earpieces
are
nice
feature
it
lets
me
disconnect
to
talk
to
real
people,
or
whatever,
while
leaving
them
quickly
accessible
to
plug
back
without
worrying
about
losing
them
or
having
to
deal
with
putting
them
in
pocket
these
bluetooth
headphones
are
under
$0,
so
don't
expect
the
best
soundfor
the
price,
they
work
finepaired
with
my
desktop
easilyi
just
wish
the
controls
fob
was
smaller,
it's
kinda
bulky
compared
to
another
pair
have
these
work
well
so
far
haven
had
these
long
but
really
like
them
so
far
initially
felt
like
they
would
fall
out
of
my
ears
easily,
but
after
adjusting
to
the
smallest
earpiece,
think
they
feel
pretty
secure
when
pulled
them
out
of
the
box,
they
were
already
charged
and
connected
to
my
phone
bluetooth
right
away
ve
had
issues
connecting
with
other
bluetooth
headphones
the
sound
seems
on
par
with
my
previous
bluetooth
headphones
also
like
how
they
are
magnetized
so
that
you
can
wear
them
around
your
neck
without
losing
them
so
far,
so
good
the
control
section
is
heavy
and
often
pulls
back
and
have
to
often
adjust
the
cord
back
forward
or
it
puts
pulling
pressure
on
my
ear
often
use
little
kids
small
hair
clip
to
anchor
it
in
place
otherwise
fine
these
great
head
phones
much
better
sound
quality
than
expected
for
this
price
changing
the
cushions
on
each
ear
was
little
tricky,
but
got
it
batteries
last
long
time
bluetooth
is
excellent
as
well
can
leave
my
phone
in
my
kitchen
and
walk
all
over
the
house
and
it
stays
connected
even
upstairs
the
headphones
will
be
used
for
calls,
movies
and
music
it
came
nicely
packaged
and
on
time
was
fully
charged
in
under
hours
the
sound
is
extremely
good
and
cancels
noise
superbly
gave
for
battery
life
because
used
it
for
hours,
did
no
turn
it
off
during
the
night
and
it
is
still
working
this
morning
one
of
the
best
had
so
far
love
it
these
work
great
and
are,
for
the
post
part,
comfortable
the
only
negative
is
that
there's
weird
mic
delay
causes
my
video
and
voice
to
be
out
of
sync
when
first
enter
google
meet
video
conference
it
corrects
itself
if
exit
the
meeting
and
the
jump
back
in,
but
it's
weird
nonetheless,
these
are
great
value
these
are
nice
headphones
for
$0
they
are
lightweight,
comfortable,
stay
in
the
ear,
blocks
surrounding
noises
well
and
flat
wire
prevents
tangling
good
battery
life
doesn't
need
charged
frequently
the
bass
is
little
high
but
overall
good
sound
quality
this
is
set
of
my
own
after
getting
my
spouse
some
for
christmas
these
headphones
have
great
clarity
and
sound
they
are
great
for
the
gym
and
while
on
the
airplane
they
block
out
all
noise
from
the
engines
and
other
passengers
also
excellent
for
listening
to
binaural
sound
during
meditation
headphones
stay
charged
for
long
time
bought
these
earphones
because
thought
they
will
fit
really
well
but
i'm
amazed
by
the
excellent
sound
quality
of
the
earphones,
with
great
hd
stereo
sound
and
decent
noise
cancellation
there
is
no
complaint
about
the
fitting
as
well,
does
not
fall
when
running,
unlike
the
new
"true
wireless
headphones",
which
hardly
stays
in
my
ears
during
workout
bluetooth
connection
pairs
with
my
phone
immediately
after
turning
them
onabsolutely
love
these
headphones,
would
definitely
recommend
had
thease
for
month
and
at
first
that
worked
fine
the
battery
life
was
as
expected,
no
sound
cancellation
that
could
tell
and
sound
wasn't
the
best
but
gets
the
job
done
but
after
while
they
stop
connecting
with
my
phone
via
bluetooth
was
good
product
for
the
money
being
bought
them
on
cyber
monday
thinking
got
good
deal
but
if
in
the
end
it
dosen't
work
not
worth
it
waist
of
money
just
like
anyone,
we
are
always
finding
ourselves
buying
new
ear
buds
these
are
very
nice
and
would
purchase
them
again
the
sound
quality
is
above
average
and
they
hold
charge
for
good
amount
of
time
very
pleased
got
these
headphones
for
work
was
looking
for
something
that
lasted
the
whole
day,
sounded
good
on
all
levels
from
audio
books
to
music
and
felt
comfortable
these
ended
up
being
them
returned
pair
that
had
all
the
other
traits
besides
comfort
and
even
though
was
bit
skeptical
in
purchasing
this
pair,
gave
it
shot
and
am
beyond
happythey
charge
quickly
too
ive
even
worn
them
on
run
the
night
got
them
and
they
were
great,
use
blue
tooth
wireless
though
for
running
so
dont
get
bothered
by
cordthese
are
great
and
priced
right,
def
recommend
these
headphones
are
steal
the
sound
is
great,
they
were
very
easy
to
pair,
they
fit
comfortably
bought
them
for
working
out,
but
i'm
getting
more
use
out
of
them
than
though
would
like
these
as
they
are
comfortable
with
the
extra
size
ear
piecesi
needed
the
smallest
the
sound
is
great
for
mei
don't
have
lot
of
experience
with
earphones
not
much
noise
cancellation
don't
think
these
are
really
meant
for
that
thx
this
earphone
is
so
comfortable
and
fit
as
well
as
the
battery
life
is
amazing
do
not
get
the
ringing
ears
that
have
gotten
from
previous
headphones
that
push
to
much
treble
use
it
to
listen
to
music
is
joyful
moment
another
nice
feature
is
the
magnets
on
the
back
of
the
earphone
is
nice
to
connect
them
around
your
neck
when
not
in
use
they
are
light
enough
that
you
can
easily
forget
that
you
have
them
on
the
controls
are
very
helpful
for
starting
and
stopping
what
you
are
listening
to
when
you
need
to
talk
to
someone
love
these
headphones
love
that
they
have
magnets
in
them
and
are
heavy
duty
quality
they
fit
in
my
ears
during
the
gym
and
while
up
cleaning
the
house
they
have
amazing
sound
quality
and
when
have
them
in
can
hear
hardly
anything
the
noise
canceling
is
surprisingly
well
for
the
price
this
is
an
amazing
product
very
good
product,
bought
it
because
have
wireless
earbuds,
but
battery
only
good
for
or
hours,
with
this
bluetooth
headphone
have
more
than
hours
playtime,
sound
is
very
good
,
and
it's
very
comfortable
too,
very
satisfied
am
not
an
audiophile,
but
these
are
the
best
sounding
bluetooth
earbuds
at
this
price
range
in
my
experience
i've
tried
about
dozen
over
the
years
that
is
not
to
say
that
they
are
cheaply
made
they
are
quality,
look
good,
sound
great
and
fit
well
can
afford
the
top
dollar
earbuds
but,
why,
when
these
sound
so
good
not
to
mention
have
lost
few
pairs
don't
spend
over
$0
on
pair
of
expensive
earbuds
when
these
$0
boltune
bluetooth
headphones
are
just
as
good
they
are
0%
water
resistant
as
worked
ten
hours
in
the
rain
with
them
on
while
pressure
washing
could
easily
hear
the
music
over
the
noise
of
the
motor
running
the
same
experience
with
mowing
the
lawncrisp
sound
with
no
distortion
the
magnetic
clasp
is
lifesaver
it
keeps
the
headphones
securely
wrapped
around
my
neck
and
they
are
very
comfortable
to
wear
my
music
is
so
crystal
clear
now
and
no
static
this
is
upstanding
products
and
you
don't
break
the
bank
buying
them
if
you
love
your
music
then
you
love
it
even
more
through
these
ear
buds
i've
found
these
headphones
to
be
very
well
rounded
sound
quality
is
very
good
in
the
under
$0
catagory;
combined
with
the
comfort,
waterresistance,
and
long
battery
life,
i've
not
been
able
to
find
anything
better
for
less
than
$0
will
make
great
stocking
stuffer
really
like
these
headphones
they
work
really
well
and
they
sound
amazingdidnt
leave
star
review
due
to
the
battery
this
is
actually
my
second
time
purchasing
these
headphones
as
the
first
time
the
battery
failed
and
wouldnt
stay
charged
after
being
chargedi
tried
other
headphones
and
ended
up
coming
back
to
these
as
they
do
work
really
well
and
the
person
talk
to
on
the
phone
can
hear
me
clearly
ended
up
buying
this
as
gift
for
my
sister
too
lol
over
the
years,
have
purchased
several
types
of
wireless
earbuds;
jaybirds,
beats,
skullcandy,
etc
and
these
are
by
far
the
best
purchase
ever
the
magnetic
clasp
is
an
excellent
feature
which
prevents
them
falling
off
when
not
in
use;
sound
quality
is
great,
and
the
battery
life
is
excellent
and
accurately
described
sleep
with
my
earbuds
nightly
and
they
have
never
fell
out
of
my
ears
have
purchased
of
these
so
far
as
gifts
for
my
family
and
they
all
love
these
as
well
highly
recommend
this
is
the
second
rating
for
these
earphones
they
have
the
longest
battery
life
have
experienced
plus
they
are
extremely
loudone
pair
for
the
phone
and
one
for
the
televisioni
even
like
the
placement
of
the
buttons
on
the
control
piece
bought
these
for
the
gym
got
them
today
and
already
used
them
these
headphonesmeet
most
of
the
promises
in
the
descriptiongreat
sound
and
extremely
comfortablethese
headphones
have
nice
design,
feel
durable,
and
can
reach
very
high
volume
levelsi
haven't
monitored
the
battery
life
since
only
used
it
today
didn
hear
anybody
on
the
background
while
working
out
also
great
for
voice
calls
they
work
pretty
goodhowever,
overall
would
still
recommend
these
headphones
like
it
better
than
the
anker
ones
had
don't
like
that
can't
easily
check
battery
life
and
how
if
you
just
have
one
ear
in,
the
weight
of
the
other
headphone
pulls
the
one
in
your
ear
out
bit,
but
the
magnet
works
great
and
such
enjoy
that
these
headphones
rest
comfortably
with
magnetic
connection
around
your
neck
and
are
easily
accessible
their
sound
quality
is
great
and
noise
cancellation
very
effective
they
stay
in
place
as
move
around
lotmy
one
complaint
is
that
they
don't
pair
with
my
macbook
pro
from
0,
macos
high
sierra
they
did
at
first,
but
then
suddenly
stopped,
and
even
after
i've
wiped
the
memory
of
the
headphones
and
restarted
my
mac
bluetooth
they
still
don't
work
that's
disappointing
and
i'd
like
help
resolving
it
i've
bought
three
sets
of
these,
they're
my
favorite
headphones
battery
life
is
amazing
use
them
on
hour
shifts
at
work
and
they
last
all
shift
and
into
the
next
one
they
also
charge
really
fast
0/0
would
recommend
this
product
provides
great
audio
and
long
battery
life
as
expected
the
bluetooth
connectivity
is
faulty,
working
around
0%
of
the
timethe
major
problem
is
that
the
power
led
will
stay
stuck
in
cycle
switching
between
red
and
blue
lights
causing
the
device
to
not
connect
to
any
of
my
devices
my
only
solution
is
that
have
to
connect
the
headphones
to
the
charger
again
to
turn
off
the
device
and
then
restart
to
work
again
please
improve
the
quality
of
this
product
the
quality
is
great,
the
sound
is
strong
and
can
be
good
distance
away
from
my
device
and
still
get
great
connection
without
an
interruption
even
got
to
use
them
in
the
shower
couple
times
nothing
ever
bad
happened
to
them
all
of
sudden
it
just
wouldn
turn
on
anymore
it
wasn
water
damage
because
it
would
ve
been
obvious
or
noticeable
right
away
or
start
glitching
just
want
headphones
that
can
at
least
last
me
more
than
year
only
lasted
months
with
these
headphones
headphones
were
very
well
designed
and
last
longer
than
other
expensive
ones
ive
bought
in
the
past
will
be
buying
new
pair
sooni've
had
them
for
about
year
they've
been
put
through
hell
and
back,
and
just
recently
did
they
start
to
break
some
of
the
best
headphones
i've
had
sound
quality
was
okay,
but
these
never
really
fit
in
my
ears
also,
do
not
trust
that
this
product
is
waterresistant
as
advertised
found
it
odd
that
they
stopped
working
just
few
days
after
the
option
to
return
them
expired
will
be
shopping
elsewhere
to
replace
them
bought
these
because
of
rated
battery
life
work
hour
shift
and
like
to
listen
to
audio
books
while
work
at
mid
volume
listening
to
books,
still
have
0%
battery
life
after
my
shift
music
at
higher
volumes,
about
0%
left
after
my
shifti
was
impressed
with
the
sound
quality
as
well
they
sound
amazing,
good
highs,
and
great
lowsthey
lose
star
for
calls
though
no
one
can
hear
me
when
used
as
headset
for
calls
but
not
big
deal
for
me,
just
needed
some
decent
headphones
lol
and
for
the
price,
cant
beat
them
would
buy
again
really
love
these
headphones
perfect
for
the
gym
when
exercise,
these
stay
in
my
ear
nice
and
secure
they're
really
comfortable
too
the
sound
quality
is
surprisingly
clear
and
audible
like
that
you
can
change
the
songs
on
the
volume
without
even
needing
to
touch
your
phone
it
comes
with
different
sized
earbuds
and
hooks
so
it
can
fit
in
your
ear
properly
haven't
tested
out
the
noise
cancellation
but
bought
my
boyfriend
pair
as
well
and
he
says
it
works
really
well
all
in
all,
these
are
pretty
good
headphones
for
the
price
overall
is
good
,
sound
quality
specially
for
music
is
not
excellent,
but
is
very
good
for
this
price
bought
it
for
listen
to
music
when
hiking,
but
it
likes
regular
headphonesfor
talking
on
he
phone
is
good
option
and
sound
is
clear
for
both
ways
another
things
that
don't
like
is
you
can
not
know
how
much
of
battery
charge
is
remainingi
gave
them
stars
because
the
costumer
service
of
this
company
is
excellent
,thank
you
the
company
needed
wireless
audio
for
working
from
home
these
have
good
quality
and
fit
nicely
earbuds
at
this
price
can
be
hit
or
miss
but
these
are
hit
for
sure
what
shame
this
was
very
decent
headset
for
the
two
months
that
it
worked
the
red
light
comes
on
during
the
charge
but
they
will
simply
not
turn
on
reached
out
to
boltune
via
email
and
of
course,
no
response
so,
it
turns
out
the
customer
service
is
second
ratejust
like
their
headsets
luckily,
only
out
about
bucks
so
it
was
very
inexpensive
lesson
of
what
hack
company
boltune
is
bought
this
to
use
with
my
phone
and
it
is
absolutely
adequate
for
my
purposes
was
even
able
to
talk
on
the
phone
while
biking
which
have
not
been
able
to
do
before
the
battery
seems
to
hold
up
well
and
is
easy
and
fast
to
charge
the
sound
quality
is
not
the
best,
but
for
the
price,
it
works
well
these
earbuds
have
stellar
sound
quality,
fit
ears
perfectly,
and
are
easy
to
operate
they
have
been
great
help
while
teleworking
during
the
covid0
quarantine
thanks
for
great
product
they
seemed
to
work
very
well
for
the
first
three
weeks
and
then
suddenly
wouldn't
turn
on
charged
them
thinking
must
have
accidentally
left
them
on
after
very
long
charge
time
over
day
was
able
to
turn
them
on
used
them
for
an
hour
and
then
made
sure
turned
them
off
the
next
day
again
they
wouldn't
turn
on
after
using
it
for
multiple
days
have
to
say
this
is
pretty
good
sweat
resistance
is
0%
and
the
sound
quality
rivals
some
dollar
headphones
noise
isolation
is
pretty
good
too
but
the
magnets
in
the
headphones
for
better
organization
and
to
help
keep
it
from
tangling
is
surprisingly
awesome
the
battery
life
was
much
more
than
expected
bought
these
for
my
wife
some
time
ago
and
she
liked
how
they
stayed
in
place
when
she
exercised
she
also
was
happy
with
different
sizes
allowing
her
to
find
the
perfect
fit
for
her
ear
ended
up
buying
these
for
my
young
teen
daughter
and
she
is
more
than
happy
with
them
they
worked
well
for
months
but
now
are
giving
issues
microphone
works
however
the
speakers
do
not
not
lot
of
use
for
headphones
without
speakers
had
problem
with
this
device,
reached
out
to
customer
service
and
they
qere
super
nice
to
replace
it
with
newer
upgraded
version
enjoying
my
awesome
new
headphones
thank
you
boltune
for
your
awesome
customer
service
love
these
headphones,
especially
for
the
price
have
returned
another
pair
because
they
had
issues
they
stay
in
my
ears
well
these
have
volume
control
and
you
can
go
to
the
next
song
easily
or
change
volume
also
can
turn
the
headphones
off
they
paired
with
almost
no
effort
on
my
part
even
like
the
little
bag
to
store
the
headphones
bought
these
because
got
new
phone
that
doesn't
have
typical
headphone
jack
had
an
issue
with
my
husband
hearing
me
the
first
time
called
him
but
after
restarted
my
phone
it
worked
fine
connected
the
headphones
with
both
my
phone
and
my
microsoft
surface
and
it
switches
from
surface
to
phone
automatically
when
get
call
they
are
comfortable
and
the
sound
quality
is
good
they
were
easy
to
set
up
haven't
used
them
lot
but
so
far
am
very
happy
with
the
purchase
great
product
love
being
able
to
listen
while
doing
housework
easy
to
hang
around
your
neck
when
not
in
use
with
the
attached
magnets
on
the
earbuds
have
small
ears
so
other
headphones
don
work
for
me
these
have
different
size
options
would
definitely
recommend
bought
pairs,
one
pair
for
me
and
one
pair
for
my
wife
the
first
charge
last
maybe
or
hours,
because
after
my
first
use
they
died
while
was
at
the
gym
recharged
and
they
did
the
same
thing
now
they
won't
even
charge
my
wife's
seem
to
working
ok
good
luck
if
you
decide
to
purchase
would
give
star
review,
but
the
sound
quality
is
very
goodupdated:
upgraded
to
stars
because
the
company
reached
out
to
me
and
offered
replacement
it
took
them
while
but
it
was
good
they
finally
did
decent
pair
of
cordless
headphones,
little
heavy
but
worked
for
running
and
working
around
the
yard
but
it
died
within
three
months,
with
twice/weekly
use
buyer
beware
really
like
these;
and
for
the
price
that
are
great
own
pair
of
wireless
jaybirds
that
use
for
running
they
were
about
$0
the
botune's
are
more
reliable
don't
get
any
delay
when
listening
to
music
from
my
apple
watch
unfortunately,
this
isn't
the
same
with
the
jaybirds
the
most
annoying
thing
for
runner
is
when
your
earbuds
cut
in
and
out
little
bit
bulky
in
the
ear
put
the
smaller
ear
pieces
in
and
the
fit
was
better,
takes
little
getting
used
to
due
to
the
design
sound
is
really
good
and
loud
these
are
ok
as
an
inexpensive
bluetooth
earbud
the
wire
between
them
could
be
longer
the
controls
are
logical
and
easy
to
use
they
are
not
noise
cancelling,
but
they
are
not
advertised
as
noise
cancelling
really
like
these
earbuds
they
are
nice
and
loud,
and
they
instantly
paired
with
both
my
phone
and
my
mac
they
also
charged
really
fast
the
package
comes
with
extra
earpieces
and
carrying
case,
which
is
really
helpful
do
recommend
had
lost
pair
similar
to
these
by
another
manufacturer
so
had
something
to
compare
these
to
had
to
push
the
lost
pair
back
into
my
ear
all
the
time
because
of
the
weight,
these
were
much
lighter
and
rarely,
if
ever,
fall
out
the
sound
quality
and
noise
cancellation
is
also
much
better
because
can
actually
listen
to
the
music
instead
of
constantly
having
to
push
them
back
in
my
ears
these
headphones
are
great
the
sound
quality
is
amazing
even
received
mine
day
earlier
than
was
supposed
to
the
price
is
great
for
the
product
quality
they
come
with
great
variety
of
ear
pieces,
that
feel
comfortable
in
your
ear
would
recommend
them
the
bass
and
sound
quality
are
amazing
for
the
price
you
pay
way
better
that
airpods
not
great
for
laying
down
since
the
protrude
quite
bit
and
it's
uncomfortable
to
lay
on
your
side
perfect
to
deter
strangers
from
interacting
with
me
stranger
danger
got
these
for
my
son,
he
lost
the
ones
that
came
with
his
phone
these
are
so
high
quality
,
durable
and
nice
looking
,
very
comfortable
to
wear
they
really
compare
to
the
brand
name
amazing
sound
quality
worth
the
price
overall
these
were
pretty
terrible
buy,
while
the
sound
quality
was
ok
the
battery
life
was
pretty
short
and
the
headphones
fell
constantly
our
of
my
ears,
after
just
over
months
of
occasional
use,
they
stopped
taking
charge
or
turning
on
completely
0%
would
not
purchase
again
well
made
doesnt
feel
cheap
sounds
great
with
pretty
good
bass
and
sound
cancelation
not
bad
for
the
price
the
magnetic
heads
make
it
much
easier
to
keep
track
of
than
the
wireless
headphones
bought
these
for
my
husband
and
my
daughter
you
can
not
go
wrong
for
the
price
they
fit
in
your
ear
well
and
the
sound
is
good
if
your
in
the
fence
about
buying
them,
don
be
they
are
great
sound
quality
is
midgrade
but
good
for
the
price
product
worked
great
until
it
didn't
months
after
purchase
and
the
charge
port
no
longer
works
update:
contacted
customer
service
and
after
couple
minutes
of
troubleshooting
they
sent
me
out
free
replacement
set
very
pleased
with
the
purchase
so
far
didn't
expect
these
to
work
as
well
as
they
do
actually
like
them
better
than
the
beats
for
iphone
they
fit
the
ear
nicely
they
also
respond
very
quickly
when
you
dictate
text
absolutely
amazing
have
gone
through
many
different
headsets
and
these
by
far
are
my
favorite
the
time
it
takes
to
charge
is
little
longer
than
some,
especially
when
they
are
dead
but
worth
the
wait
they
actually
stay
in
my
ears
during
vigorous
workouts
my
ears
are
smaller
so
have
hard
time
with
earbuds
and
these
by
far
work
like
charm
the
price
is
absolutely
unbeatable
for
the
sound
quality
and
battery
life
bought
some
for
my
mom
because
they
work
so
well
my
husband
loves
these
headphones
you
can
beat
the
price
he
had
several
sets
of
expensive
headphones
$0+
that
last
barely
year
and
sound
quality
is
soso
he
said
these
headphones
were
loud
enough
to
hear
over
the
lawnmower
one
of
the
things
that
like
lot
about
this
headphones,
is
how
practical
they
are,
how
great
they
sound,
and
how
easy
it
is
to
paired
with
your
phone,
not
to
mention
that
the
battery
last
long
time
honestly
the
most
durable
headset
i've
ever
owned
the
sound
is
amazingly
clear
and
can
walk
feet
away
from
device
and
still
be
connected
it
easily
connects
between
my
smart
tv
and
phone
when
call
comes
in
that's
cool
it's
very
hot
outside
but
no
sweat
they
are
waterproof,
even
in
rain
storm
the
size
was
little
awkward
at
first
but
used
the
included
ear
pieces
to
get
custom
fit
i'm
looking
forward
to
buying
the
upgraded
pair
with
the
equalizer
bluetooth
is
awesome
wore
them
for
nearly
so
long
before
charging
them
forgot
they
were
wirelessi
work
out
for
roughly
to
minutes,
to
days
week
after
about
hour
charge,
was
set
for
the
next
weeks
before
needing
to
charge
again
for
the
price,
these
are
excellent
would
like
bit
more
bass,
bit
with
the
additional
pieces
was
able
to
find
better
fit
for
sound
not
noise
canceling,
yet
dont
believe
they
are
actually
prefer
bit
out
noise
pollution
so
am
aware
of
my
surroundings
these
are
great
headphones
light
weight
and
comfortable
can
now
work
in
the
yard
without
worrying
about
wires
getting
in
the
wayvery
fast
delivery
also
love
these
they
stay
in
my
ear,
did
have
to
switch
to
the
proper
fitting
ear
piece
for
my
ear,
runner
and
they
do
not
fall
out
the
sound
is
awesome
very
very
happy
great
sound,
long
battery
life,
like
the
way
they
look
only
thing
wished
it
had
was
clip
to
clip
to
my
clothing,
other
then
that
am
very
satisfied
with
this
product
awesome
headphones
for
the
price
easy
to
connect
with
any
device
and
comfortable
to
wear
for
longer
period
of
time
the
sound
quality
is
almost
like
my
bose
inear
no
tinny
sound
on
these
actually
ordered
second
pair
to
connect
both
at
the
same
time
with
the
boltune
bluetooth
adapter
on
my
lg
0k
tv
for
better
understanding
movieas
they
are
inears
the
noise
cancellation
feature
was
not
expectedgreat
find,
highly
recommend
purchased
these
earbuds
based
on
the
reviews
and
the
price
replaced
another
competitor's
earbuds
that
didn't
even
last
year
have
to
say
that
am
truly
impressed
with
the
sound
quality
and
overall
quality
of
the
earbuds
love
these
earbuds
lost
my
first
pair
doing
landscaping,
tried
to
replace
with
another
for
half
the
price
from
local
store,
and
was
deeply
disappointed
had
to
order
this
pair
because
these
are
the
best
have
ever
worn,
and
such
great
price
you
won
be
disappointed
with
this
pair
was
extremely
sceptical
about
these
but
to
my
astonishment
they
sound
way
better
than
thought
this
is
my
first
pair
ever
like
the
high
end
wired
would
definitely
recommend
this
to
anyone
who
loves
music
0nd
pair
i've
bought,
believe
equals
so
why
not
have
pairs
fits
in
the
ear
nice
and
snug
without
feeling
too
tight
buttons
are
little
bit
bigger
than
the
first
pair
which
is
nice
when
wearing
gloves
like
do
was
forced
to
look
for
new
pair
of
headphones
after
one
side
went
on
my
last
pair
have
incredibly
tiny
ears
and
often
have
issues
with
earbuds
being
too
large
and
falling
out
so
far
so
good
ve
now
worked
and
cleaned
my
house
with
these
on
without
losing
them
ve
had
them
for
almost
week
and
not
yet
had
to
charge
them
sound
quality
is
lovely
even
at
higher
volumes
do
wish
the
noise
cancellation
was
little
better,
but
overall
super
happy
with
this
purchase
got
them
as
gift
for
my
trail
running
brother
&
for
the
last
week
he
has
been
raving
about
them
just
tried
them
myself
for
the
first
time
today
&
usually
use
my
apple
airpods
so
used
to
that
&
these
are
arguable
better
in
sound
also
usually
these
bids
fall
right
out
of
my
ears
and
they
are
so
secure
he
keeps
commenting
on
how
they
don
fall
out
&
they
cancel
all
the
noise
around
him
too
really
awesome
great
purchase
would
buy
again
do
not
usually
leave
reviews
but
am
impressed
have
purchased
quite
few
pairs
of
headphones
online
and
they
all
disappointed,
and
did
not
last
long
this
pair
for
the
price
is
very
nice
quality
comfortable,
good
sound,
and
long
battery
life
would
repurchase
this
item
these
headphones
are
phenomenal
charged
them
up
days
ago,
and
still
have
0%
left
with
plenty
of
use
people
hear
me
very
well
when
having
phone
conversations
plenty
of
bass
and
works
well
with
all
of
my
media
players
it
paired
easy
and
stays
connected
no
sudden
drops
they
stay
in
my
ears
without
calling
out
if
had
to
find
one
negative
thing
to
report
about
them,
it
would
be
that
the
headphones
sit
slightly
outside
of
my
ears
and
do
not
stay
fully
inside
my
ears
may
just
need
to
switch
to
smaller
ear
pad
headset
is
solid
and
bought
second
for
my
wife
only
issue
have
is
the
size
they
are
big
in
your
and
although
you
don't
notice
too
much
and
they
stay
put
after
long
time
in
they
are
heavy
but
that
size
gives
amazing
battery
life
have
used
multiple
days
without
needing
acharge
great
sound
and
fit
my
ears
perfectly
does
come
with
other
ear
pieces
so
if
you
have
fit
problem
you
can
switch
them
out
do
recommend
these
look
nice
and
they
are
very
light
as
well,
they
fit
comfortable
and
the
battery
life
on
them
are
incredible
to
be
so
light
the
noise
canceling
on
these
work
wonders
and
the
sound
quality
isn
half
bad
either
these
headphones
are
fantastic,
especially
for
the
price
was
surprised
how
great
the
sound
is
and
they
stay
in
my
ears
well
during
my
workout
and
when
i'm
running
on
the
treadmill
love
that
they
came
with
different
size
ear
pieces
as
well,
because
need
the
smallest
size
they
would
be
perfect
if
they
had
an
adjuster
to
pick
up
some
of
the
cord
slack
in
the
back
but
overall,
these
are
fantastic
headphones
it
has
good
sound,
but
it
is
not
noisecanceling
beware
that
selecting
filter
doesn't
mean
every
item
that
shows
up
has
that
feature
should
have
paid
closer
attention
to
the
actual
specs
and
not
relied
on
amazon's
filtering
just
received
the
headphones,
and
totally
happy
with
them
the
sound
is
awesome
and
comfort
of
the
buds

very
easy

anyone
looking
to
purchase
headphones
and
not
spend
bunch
of
money
these
are
perfect
for
me
these
earbuds
have
been
absolutely
fantastic
spend
huge
amount
of
time
on
the
phone
everyone
i've
talked
to

told
me
that
my
voice
sounds
crystal
clear
the
sound
quality
for
music,
videos,
and
phone
calls
have
been
excellent
they
sync
seamlessly
with
my
phone
and
laptop
simultaneously,
all
the
time
the
battery

to
be
ridiculously
long

day,
non
stop,
and
the
battery
doesn't
die
for
$0,
don't

in
earbuds
uno
de
mis
audífonos
favoritos,
he
comprado
veces
estos
audífonos,
impecables
prefiero
estos
que
la
versión
pro,
aunque
también
son
buenos
these
are
larger
on
the
outside
than
expected
but
the
magnet
is
handy,
they
fit
my
small
ears
and
the
battery
is
the
most
impressive
in
terms
of
life
have
been
using
the
boltune
bluetooth
headphones
for
about
two
weeks
now
and
it
has
been
great
experience
the
first
thing
to
strike
me
was
that
the
earpieces
are
slightly
heavier
than
expected
them
to
be
which
suggests
great
build
quality
the
sound
quality
is
as
good
as
any
premium
headphones
however
there
is
slight
background
noise
when
audio
is
not
playing,
which
have
found
out
is
concern
for
all
bluetooth
headphones
the
background
noise
goes
away
when
audio
is
playedoverall,
has
been
great
buy
these
are
quality
headphones
the
battery
lasts
recharging
is

good
sound
quality
they
are
well
made
and
durable
they
stay
in
my
ears
without
hurting
them
which
lot
of
headphones
seem
to
do
these
are
waterproof
so
can
run
in
the
rain
these
are
every
bit
as
good
as
some
of
the
very
expensive
name
brand
headphones
of
similar
style
love
them
and
use
them
ever
my
day
at
work
to
listen
to
music,
audiobooks,
and
podcasts
planning
to
buy
pair
for
others
in
my
life
who
think
would
appreciate
them
these
have
good
sound
quality,
and
cancel
noise
very
well
thinkthe
battery
life
on
these
lasted
my
all
day
and
then
charge
them
at
nightgreat
bluetooth
headphones
for
the
price
these
phones
head
,
are
great
lightweight
,
different
ear
pieces
for
smaller
ears
sound
was
awesome
will
recemend
to
all
seriously
incredibly
comfortable
headphones
they
have
deep
bass,
good
treble,
natural
midrange
headphones
fit
easily
into
your
ears
ears
do
not
hurt
from
prolonged
listening
to
music
treble
does
not
cut
the
ear
the
wire
is
strong,
reliable
the
headphones
themselves
are
really
waterproof,
specifically
made
test
after
the
test,
they
work
like
new
smooth
volume
control,
excellent
integration
with
your
smartphone
put
it
on,
turn
on
your
smartphone,
turn
on
your
music
and
enjoy
thank
you
great
headphones,
mines
lasted
for
whole
0hrs
,
charging
it
after
its
dead
took
about
0/0
to
0hrs
to
charge
the
sound
is
greatcertains
songs
turned
the
volume
down
because
it
can
be
very
loud
when
at
its
highest
volume
and
the
noise
cancellation
is
great
as
well
the
only
issue
have
are
the
rubber
hooks
that
goes
on
your
ear
to
keep
it
place,
it
didnt
feel
good
against
my
ears
but
that's
just
me
but
do
reccomend
them
these
are
great
earbuds
for
the
money
the
sound
quality
is
good,
they
cancel
out
noise
well
and
have
an
excellent
battery
life
would
have
rated
them
except
that
bought
them
to
listen
to
music
in
bed
as
am
side
sleeper,
the
magnets
that
would
hold
them
together
if
were
active,
are
too
large
to
sleep
on
comfortably
use
these
for
the
gym
and
they
work
really
well
haven
tried
them
for
phone
calls
yet
but
the
audio
for
music
is
quite
nice
they
re
not
clunky
and
the
magnetic
feature
is
really
handy
my
ear
didn't
feel
too
tired
or
uncomfortable
after
wearing
for
hours
the
price
is
twenty
something,
didn't
expect
it
can
totally
cancel
all
noise
think
the
sound
quality
is
worth
the
money
these
are
handsdown,
the
best
earbuds
ve
purchased
at
any
price
rarely
write
reviews,
but
can
believe
the
battery
life
and
sound
quality
of
these
use
at
work
and
the
gym,
and
have
replaced
many
more
expensive
sets
actually
don
mind
paying
more
for
quality,
but
was
tired
of
spending
increasingly
more
for
soso
sound
and
awful
battery
life
so
purchased
these
just
because
of
the
reviews
was
skeptical,
but
am
0%
thrilled
with
my
purchase
the
only
dislike
have
is
how
easily
lose
these
headphones
this
is
my
third
pair
in
the
past
two
years
but
that
is
only
because
im
clumsy
other
than
that
really
enjoy
these
headphones
in
more
ways
than
one
the
sound
quality
is
up
to
par
with
someone
like
me
who
is
an
audio
snob
and
doesn't
settle
for
anything
less
than
amazing
have
very
simple
review
i've
bought
many
bluetooth
headphones
but
these
are
the
best
in
terms
of
sound,
noise
cancelling
and
battery
life
i'm
going
on
teo
days
without
recharging
boltune
headphones
worth
every
penny
incredible
performance
and
quality
for
your
money

what

what
haven't
liked/like
extends
out
of

enough
such
that
it
doesn't
work
with
beanies
or
my
ski
helmetoverall,
am
pleased
with
the
purchase
and
look
forward
to
using
these
regularly
in
the
future
have
owned
the
earbuds
for
about
months
now
and
have
to
say
they
are
really
great
for
the
money
they
last
all
day
long
at
my
hr
job
and
are
really
comfortable
wish
the
cord
was
maybe
longer
but
it
very
minor
gripe
well
worth
the
money
great
wireless
headphones
the
bluetooth
connection
is
excellent,
did
not
find
any
defects
in
the
quality
of
the
connection

parcel
was
delivered
as
soon
as
possible;
during
unpacking,
no
defects
were
also
detected
headphones
fit
securely
into
my
ears,
can
be
sure
that
they
will
not
fall
out
of
my
ears
good
ear
pads
my
ears
do
not
sweat
in
these
headphones
the
sound
quality
is
excellent,
incredibly
happy
with
the
purchase
the
wire
is
reliable,
all
buttons
work
great
ear
buds
super
comfortable,
great
battery
life
love
the
magnetic
feature
to
keep
them
around
my
neck
the
noise
cancellation
was
perfect
for
me
dulled
the
noise
but
didn't
completely
cancel
unfortunately
they
stopped
worked
but
thanks
to
the
great
customer
service
got
these
returned
and
new
set
ordered
and
on
the
way
can't
wait
to
get
them
and
get
listening
again
these
headphones
work
great
am
able
to
use
these
headphone
with
zoom
and
teams
meetings
and
online
gaming
and
the
sound
quality
is
great
no
issues
with
people
hearing
me
on
the
other
end
either
these
headphones
automatically
connect
to
my
phone
as
soon
as
turn
on
the
bluethooth
on
them
and
the
phone
in
the
past
had
other
headphones
that
had
trouble
connecting
them
sound
quality
is
good,
ve
gone
running
in
the
rain
with
them
obviously
it
wasn
pouring
outside,
but
it
was
raining
little
bit
and
they
worked
perfectly
they
last
long
time
without
charging
very
pleased
with
these
headphones
quality
at
low
price
nice
bluetooth
don't
have
trouble
with
the
connection
and
people
can
hear
me
clearly
battery
life
is
great
my
only
complaint
are
the
stupid
blinking
lights
when
you
use
them
in
dark
room
it's
bit
irritating,
but
i've
had
hard
time
finding
pair
that
doesn't
do
that
work
as
bus
driver
am
forbidden
to
include
music
in
the
entire
salonbut
really
love
music
especially
at
work,
because
without
it's
boringi
decided
to
buy
these
headphones
they
are
worth
the
moneythey
have
good
sound
quality
and
noise
absorptionbut
most
of
all
liked
the
fact
that
they
did
not
last
long
this
is
really
cool
especially
in
my
professionthanks
seller
had
concerns
because
they
were
so
cheap,
but
are
great
like
any
small
electronics,
handle
with
care
&
they
ll
last
had
mine
for
over
year
now
am
0%
satisfied
with
my
purchase
of
these
headphones
was
pleasantly
surprised
when
tried
them
out
and
listened
to
my
music
with
them
for
the
0st
time
am
very
active
person
and
go
through
gym
headphones
quite
often,
and
the
best
headphones
have
ever
owned
great
bass,
great
sound
quality
,
very
comfortable
and
love
the
magnets
and
the
nice
bag
it
comes
with
everything
is
high
quality
and
at
this
price
am
very
impressed
awesome,
must
have
great
products
go
to
the
gym
lot,
five
to
six
times
week,
and
i've
needed
some
thing
to
listen
to
music
while
workout
this
has
worked
great
for
me,
and
highly
recommend
it
these
headphones
are
light
weight,
comfortable
and
the
battery
life
is
very
good
they
are
good
product
at
most
reasonable
price
they
worked
okay
for
the
first
few
weeks,
but
then
started
noticing
something
that
sounded
like
staticeven
after
turned
the
earbuds
off
turns
out,
it
was
short
got
used
to
turning
the
earbuds
back
on
after
every
minutes
or
so
when
they
would
short
out,
but
they
stopped
charging
probably
good
thing,
and
i'm
left
with
magnetic
necklace
avoid
this
purchase
they
work
great
and
sound
great
tried
airpod
style
ones
and
they
sucked
two
different
brands
with
the
same
issues
not
these
wasn't
expecting
much
for
$0
headphones
had
the
apple
airpods
but
leave
them
at
an
airplane
so
decided
to
buy
cheaper
headphones
but
with
similar
sound
quality
when
get
the
boltune
and
tried
them,
the
sound
was
amazing,
could
go
everywhere
in
my
floor
house
and
they
continue
working
with
the
same
sound
quality
am
veery
very
happy
with
my
new
boltune
will
buy
some
of
them
to
my
wife
:d
bought
these
as
back
up
headphones
for
long
sweaty
walks
with
the
dog
they
have
come
in
very
handy
for
those
walks
great
quality
sound
and
fit
in
my
ears
great
would
recommend
them
highly
i've
really
been
enjoying
this
style
of
bluetooth
headphones
but
all
the
other
ones
i've
gotten
have
ended
up
going
dead
in
one
of
the
ears
so
far,
this
model
has
been
working
great
and
when
playing
music
don't
hear
things
around
me
also,
the
battery
life
seems
longer
than
the
other
set
have
although
that
might
be
just
because
they
are
new
we'll
see
how
the
durability
of
these
ones
are
but
so
far
the
sound
quality
and
comfort
is
great
great
ear
phones
connects
quickly
and
battery
life
is
good
love
that
these
are
magnetic
so
we
don't
loose
it
good
for
the
wife
and
the
husband
this
is
keeper
for
us
bought
these
feb
0,
and
just
like
everything
else
this
year
they
ve
gone
to
crap
won
charge
or
anything
looking
for
different
brand
had
tried
$0
wireless
headset
that
was
pos
upgraded
to
this
for
few
dollars
more
and
couldn't
be
more
happy
sound
quality
and
volume
control
is
very
good
it's
also
working
very
well
for
voice
calls
sound
quality
on
both
ends
is
clear
and
strong
can
recommend
them
without
reservation
i've
only
been
using
the
bluetooth
headphones
for
couple
days
so
far,
so
goodi
like
that
the
playtime
is
relatively
long,
the
earbuds
are
magnetic
so
won't
lose
them
easily,
and
stay
put
in
my
ears
i'm
only
ft
tall,
so
my
ears
are
pretty
small
wondered
if
they'd
be
bit
too
big,
but
they
fit
me
well
didn't
test
out
how
waterproof
it
is,
but
the
coating
seems
like
it'll
do
well
against
rain
and
sweat
ive
only
had
these
couple
weeks
but
love
that
the
battery
life
is
hours
as
opposed
to
only
or
hours
other
bluetooth
earphones
and
thr
very
comfortable
in
my
ears
to
be
honest
read
all
the
great
reviews
but
was
still
skeptical,
until
now
was
using
wired
earbuds
my
new
phone
had
no
earbud
jack,
so
pulled
the
trigger
on
this
one
cannot
say
enough
good
things
about
these,
great
sound,
battery
lasts
me
week,
and
no
connectivity
issues
buy
these
you
will
be
glad
you
did
your

video
got
these
for
my
dad
for
work
and
he
said
he
loves
them
they
work
great
and
he
can
just
put
them
around
his
neck
when
he
is
not
using
them
these
have
surprisingly
good
bass
it's
been
difficult
for
me
to
find
headphones
that
aren't
beats,
jvc,
or
sony
that
have
awesome
bass
disclaimer:
like
so
much
bass
that
my
ear
drums
vibrate
these
don't
quite
have
that
much
bass,
but
they're
perfect
for
when
workout
these
have
an
awesome
reach
my
kid
practices
lacrosse
out
back
while
her
phone
is
inside
they
come
through
fabulous
the
batter
life
is
pretty
good
as
well
it
lasted
about
week
without
charge
definitely
good
buy
did
not
rate
as
they
tend
to
fall
out
of
my
ears
when
am
moving
around
lot,
perhaps
its
the
shape
of
my
ears,
agree,
but
the
magnets
that
assume
are
for
speakers
and
so
they
stick
together
if
could
do
stars,
would,
will
guess
the
magnets
are
part
to
blame,
as
the
weight
is
hanging
out
in
the
air
could
care
less
about
stick
together
if
they
stayed
in
better,
as
think
they
would
again,
in
my
ears
headphones:
use
these
headphones
primarily
for
running
and
for
answering
phone
calls
during
driving
really
like
these
headphones
the
bass
is
great
they
fit
snugly
in
my
ears,
as
wellcustomer
service:
the
headphones
stopped
charging
within
months
called
customer
service
and
they
were
very
prompt
with
their
action
after
verifying
that
the
headphones
were
indeed
not
charging
they
sent
me
replacement
in
two
days
very
satisfied
thanks
great
headphones
easy
to
set
up
and
start
using
within
in
minutes
of
opening
the
box
various
earpiece
sizes
included
and
helped

not

the

horrible

these

i'm

inear
headphones
work

when

the
additional
earbud

as
sometimes
find
myself
having
to
use
different

the

been

loved
these
headphones
initially
however,
in
less
than
year
they
stopped
working
have
been
in
contact
with
boltune
for
the
last
months
and
they
continually
promise
to
send
me
replacement
pair
and
then
never
do
they
have
claimed
to
send
pairs
and
have
received
zero
really
disappointed
because
loved
these
headphones
and
would
buy
new
pair,
but
i'm
worried
they'll
break
again
and
then
will
be
out
again
even
looking
at
other
pairs,
none
of
them
seem
to
be
as
good
for
my
preferences,
but
i'm
disappointed
about
how
these
worked
out
these
arrived
quickly
and
well
packaged
the
box
also
included
an
assortment
of
earpieces
in
various
sizes,
the
charging
cable
and
mesh
pouch
for
storage
the
headphones
paired
to
my
phone
easily
and
the
sound
quality
is
quite
good
would
not
say
they
are
totally
noise
cancelling,
but
they
do
cut
down
on
lot
of
background
noise
the
earpieces
are
comfortable
and
stayed
in
my
ears
even
while
running
love
the
magnet
clasp
for
keeping
these
secure
around
my
neck
when
not
in
use
am
in
love
with
the
earpiece
within
the
past
months,
i've
purchased
different
expensive
earpieces
which
came
with
good
online
reviews
but
were
total
disappointmentthis
earpiece
has
worked
beyond
my
expectations
and
it's
the
least
expensive
of
all
the
ones
i've
boughtto
sum
it
up,
buy
it
and
you'll
never
regret
it
these
charge
with
micro
usb
charger,
and
this
is
my
second
pair
the
first
pair
worked
great
and
charged
with
any
micro
usb,
the
second
only
charges
with
the
short
included
charger,
not
total
disaster,
but
disappointingwouldn't
mind
replacement
to
see
if
the
third
set
charges
more
like
the
firstoutstanding
customer
service
they
fixed
it
up
right,
really
appreciate
it
every
now
and
then,
the
microphone
doesn't
pick
up
what
said
this
is
my
second
pair,
and
quite
honestly,
the
first
pair
worked
better
these
have
to
be
paired
every
time
turn
them
on
it's
quite
annoying
doesn't
that
defeat
the
purpose
of
pairing
them
this
is
the
second
time
i'm
leaving
this
feedback,
and
quite
frankly
the
star
rating
is
going
to
drop
the
package
arrived
in
fine
condition
was
able
to
open
the
box
and
start
listening
immediately
their
use
is
intuitive
enough
to
be
able
figure
things
out
without
reading
any
instructions
the
initial
charge
lasted
at
least
an
hour
the
sound
quality
is
pretty
good
and
considering
what
use
them
for
it's
more
than
good
enough
mainly
use
them
for
podcasts
and
listening
to
music
at
the
gym
some
outside
noise
bleeds
in,
but
not
enough
to
ruin
the
listening
experience
this
is
my
second
blue
tooth
earphone
from
boltune
used
the
previous
one
for
more
than
years
and
was
happy
with
it
sound
quality
is
great,
battery
life
is
also
great
like
the
magnets
on
each
buds
which
help
me
not
lose
the
earphones
when
not
in
use
had
to
give
it
stars
due
to
noise
cancellation
personally
do
not
do
not
care
for
that
feature
anywayexcellent
product
like
that
these
fit
comfortably
under
my
safety
ear
muffs
had
been
looking
for
some
small
wireless
earbuds
that
did
not
stick
out
of
my
ear
and
these
were
perfect
they
have
long
battery
life
so
far
so
good
ordered
these
to
replace
different
brand
of
bluetooth
headphones
that
finally
failed
after
few
years
these
are
better
in
every
respect
good
sound
quality,
long
battery
life,
easy
to
operate,
quick
pairing
the
included
earpieces
keep
them
in
place
when
running,
working
out,
or
doing
yard
work
little
heavy,
but
they
seem
sturdy
satisfied
with
my
purchase
these
earbuds
survived
full
cycle
in
the
laundry
machine
absolute
gold
they
fit
better
than
any
jaybirds,
beats
or
airpods
have
tried,
and
have
the
longest
lifetime
far
more
than
enough
to
last
one
or
even
two
days
of
full
day
use
they
seal
out
outside
noise
well
enough
that
with
some
music
playing,
can
pretty
well
block
out
even
nearby
conversations
there
is
no
better
option
not
to
mention
the
price
is
spectacular
thank
you
for
these
have
gone
through
ton
of
headphones
over
the
years,
and
these
headphones
really
stick
out
other
than
providing
good
quality
sound
the
two
main
benefits
of
these
headphones
are:
the
magnet
is
strong
enough
to
keep
them
steady
around
your
neck
when
you
are
not
using
them
this
seems
of
small
importance,
but
is
really
quite
nice
to
have;
it
actually
stays
in
your
ears
when
you
run
overall,
for
the
price,
they
deserve
stars
have
been
using
these
earbuds
for
few
days
and
so
far
so
good
the
sound
quality
exceeds
expectation
and
there
adequate
bass
it
comes
with
several
plastic
ear
tips
for
sizing
and
they
fit
snugly
in
my
ears
the
0hour
battery
life
is
huge
plus
for
those
who
commute
or
travel
lot
also,
they
are
waterproof
which
means
no
problem
with
sweaty
workouts
overall,
this
pair
of
earbuds
is
great
buy
and
would
recommend
it
to
anyone
these
headphones
are
great
bought
pair
about
month
ago
and
they
suddenly
stopped
working
so
returned
them
but
was
so
pleased
with
the
sound
quality,
noise
cancellation,
and
design
that
went
ahead
and
bought
them
again,
hoping
the
first
ones
failing
was
just
fluke
so
far
so
good
and
one
thing
love
about
the
design
is
how
they
fit
inside
your
ear
and
not
behind
the
ear
this
makes
it
easy
on
the
days
have
to
run
while
wearing
my
sunglasses
would
use
these
more
but
every
single
time
use
them
have
to
have
my
phone
"forget"
them
and
then
re
find
them
even
if
only
switch
away
for
moment
it's
actually
really
annoying
i've
never
had
this
problem
with
my
other
bluetooth
headphones
good
quality
heaphones,
battery
lasts
plenty
long
for
my
needs
and
charges
quickly
sound
quality
is
very
nice
and
clear
they
come
with
little
carrying
pouch
and
replacement
ear
plugs
totally
zones
me
out
bought
on
whim
every
piece
is
high
after
my
local
walmart
was
sold
out
of
headphones
way
better
than
those
clunky
ones
apple
makes
so
far,
this
headset
has
held
up
quite
well
use
it
throughout
the
day
for
few
days
in
row,
then
charge
not
sure
how
low
it
actually
gets,
but
it
seems
to
keep
pretty
decent
charge
like
how
it
pairs
and
connects
so
quickly
to
my
devices,
and
comes
with
very
handy
carry
case
these
sound
good,
stay
put,
have
nice
charge
length,
and
have
pretty
good
range
best
though
is
how
clearly
the
mic
picks
up
when
i'm
talking
on
them
think
the
sound
quality
and
the
noise
cancellation
of
these
headphones
were
great
they
didn't
last
long
though
fortunately,
boltune
gave
me
another
one;
so
they
get
bonus
star
from
me
for
customer
service
they
sound
great
very
crisp
highs,
lows
and
midrange
calls
are
loud
and
clear
pairing
is
easy
and
automatic
real
bang
for
the
buck
these
are
my
new
everyday
ear
buds
only
thing
don't
love
about
this
product
is
that
the
wire
is
thicker
and
consequently
less
flexible
then
i'm
used
to
for
me
it's
not
deal
killer
so
plan
on
keeping
them
bought
these
because
kept
breaking
the
overtheear
headphones
these
sound
just
as
good
and
are
so
much
more
compact
am
ordering
another
paid
for
the
wife
battery
life
on
these
is
not
exaggerated,
about
0hrs
listening
time
this
is
the
second
pair
purchased
first
pair
was
black
and
still
in
working
great
condition
purchased
grey
pair
for
my
wife
they
bring
earbuds
in
s/m/l
and
0month
warranty
which
really
isn
even
necessary
headphones
comes
with
pouch
for
storage
and
mini
usb
cable
for
charging
the
buds
are
magnetic,
which
makes
it
easy
to
leave
hanging
around
your
neck
this
have
great
sound
quality
and
great
mic
use
them
on
my
phone
and
computer
would
have
given
them
start
rating,
but
need
to
unpair
and
re
pair
them
to
my
computer
each
time
use
them
which
could
be
my
computer's
fault
because
they
work
fine
on
my
phone
and
they
don't
fit
my
wife's
ears
even
with
the
different
sized
ear
pads
or
we
would
have
definitely
gotten
second
pair
of
these
it
is
great
to
be
untethered
from
my
phone
while
walking
for
music
and
phone
calls
easy
to
pair
my
phone
with
the
bluetooth
headsets
and
no
more
problems
with
the
phones
0mm
jack
the
soft
rubber
whisker
really
works
well
to
catch
your
ear
and
hold
this
headset
with
microphone
in
place
the
microphone
does
not
have
mute
button
apparently
have
only
been
using
the
headsets
for
few
months
with
no
problems
honestly
didn't
know
what
to
expect
when
bought
these
am
bit
of
an
audiophile,
use
audiotechnica
headphones
for
every
day
use,
but
wanted
something
portable
and
lightweight
that
could
wear
when
i'm
out,
or
in
bed
to
cancel
out
noises
made
the
leap,
and
i'm
glad
did
great
sound,
decent
noise
cancellation,
and
great
battery
life
received
my
boltune
headphones
about
weeks
ago
and
they
impress
me
with
something
new
almost
everyday
the
bass
quality
is
a0
and
hearing
new
and
improved
sounds
in
old
songs
that
ve
listened
to
for
years
it
crazy
and
the
battery
life
is
mad
long
at
fully
charged
was
linked
up
to
my
phone
from
0:0am
0pm
at
work
had
no
problems
with
the
qualitythe
only
thing
that
could
hope
for
is
longer
range
four
connectivity
but
it
all
good
used
it
as
yankee
swap,
everybody
loves
it
when
it
was
unwrapped,
can
see
it
has
really
nice
packaging
it
also
came
with
small
storage
soft
bag
for
storage
to
easily
carry
i'm
and
audiophile
and
these
headphones
sound
great,
especially
for
the
price
so
clean
sounding
also
like
that
they're
magnetic
and
therefore
easily
to
store
around
your
neck
when
not
in
use
and
the
level
of
bass
is
just
sufficient
enough
and
does
not
sound
distorted,
even
at
the
max
volume
level
don't
expect
super
heavy
bass
if
that's
what
you're
looking
for
ordered
these
for
my
walk/run
and
am
very
pleased
have
small
ears
and
airpods
fall
out
all
the
time
so
needed
something
that
stays
in
during
workouts
these
definitely
fit
there
are
different
covers
and
ear
hooks
that
are
so
soft
you
don
even
know
they
are
in
your
ear
sound
quality
is
spot
on
and
the
range
for
my
iphone
xr
is
pretty
good
would
definitely
recommend
bought
nov
will
update
this
review
in
couple
of
months,
but
for
now,
battery
life
is
better
than
advertised
and
sound
quality
is
great
sound
quality
is
top
notch
especially
for
the
low
dollar
and
battery
life
is
anywhere
from
to
hours
on
high
volume
these
never
worked
out
of
the
box
bought
them
to
use
on
this
fourth
of
july
road
trip
and
now
have
to
put
up
with
talking
to
people
lol
shame
they
ll
charge
and
the
red
light
comes
on,
but
then
un
plug
them
and
try
to
turn
them
on
and
literally
nothing
happens
maybe
got
faulty
unit
needed
set
of
earphones
that
would
last
me
throughout
long
days
work
and
then
the
gym,
these
earphones
did
the
job
the
sound
quality
is
great
for
music
and
phone
calls
they
also
fit
well
in
your
ears
my
biggest
problem
with
these
earphones
are
the
multipurpose
buttons,
the
ff/rw
also
are
your
volume
up/dn
didn't
like
this
feature
this
review
is
for
my
replacement
headphones
the
original
headphones
ordered
had
crackling
sound
in
one
ear
after
about
week,
but
requested
replacement
and
had
no
problems
getting
replacement
pair
have
had
no
problems
with
thesei
also
enjoy
that
they
are
magnetic,
so
they
stay
around
your
neck
securely
when
not
in
use
these
are
great
have
had
to
use
them
as
continue
to
work
from
home
and
they
have
good
sound
and
most
importantly
to
me,
noise
cancellation
work
amazing
but
be
ready
to
buy
new
one
within
months
after
buy
my
second
one
i'm
done
with
this
brand
bought
this
around
months
ago
the
sound
quality
was
moderate,
but
many
people
told
me
it's
hard
for
them
to
hear
my
voice
clearly
when
talking
on
the
phone
few
days
ago,
it
suddenly
started
to
generate
weird
noise
without
any
reason
yesterday,
it
stopped
working
and
getting
charged
it's
practically
useless
i've
used
it
only
at
home
for
at
most
few
hours
per
week
during
the
past
months
also,
it
seems
that
it's
not
possible
to
return
this
item
at
least
for
me
purchased
these
back
in
march
after
trying
out
pair
of
bose
soundsport
headphones
these
are
better
than
the
bose
which
cost
lot
more
$
across
the
board
the
battery
life
is
about
0x
as
long,
they
don't
hurt
my
ears
or
fall
out
easily
and
the
sound
quality
is
great
would
definitely
buy
these
again
and
recommend
to
my
friends
bought
these
for
mowing
my
yard
like
the
connected
cord
so
that
in
case
one
pops
out,
don't
lose
it
but
shook
my
head,
and
they
stayed
put
pairing
is
easy,
the
earbuds
are
comfortable
better
for
me
than
that
fruit's
earbud
products,
and
just
love
the
magnet
at
the
end
of
each
bud
so
they
connect
around
your
neck
very
happy
so
fari
have
not
tested
battery
life
yet
it
took
day
to
get
used
to
it
but
it
works
very
good
and
has
good
quality
sound,
didn
give
stars
because
personally
don
like
that
have
to
feel
around
for
the
canceling
call
button
over
all
it
good
product,
recommend
it
battery
life
is
almost
double
from
my
old
ones
ear
pieces
stay
put
and
have
weird
ears
that
don't
usually
hold
this
type
well
sound
quality
is
decent
for
the
price
bought
these
to
take
on
the
airplane
instead
of
my
big
headphones
they
are
light
and
compact
wasn't
expecting
much
in
the
sound
quality
area,
but
was
wrong
not
only
are
they
easy
to
use,
they
sound
wonderful
as
well
my
flight
was
over
hours
and
they
were
comfortable
to
wear
and
the
battery
life
is
great,
would
recommend
these
to
anyone
they
were
amazing
did
start
to
hurt
the
ears
after
longer
usage
but
good
quality
and
sound
would
buy
again
these
worked
great,
especially
for
the
cost
have
used
for
about
week
now
and
have
been
very
happy
still
getting
used
to
not
being
connected
to
my
phone
bought
my
first
pair
couple
of
months
ago
and
had
to
reorder
as
gift
for
my
momthe
headphones
work
great
so
far,
no
damage
and
the
battery
lasts
forever
use
them
every
day
for
work
and
driving
the
only
little
problem
is
that
sometimes
the
person
on
the
other
side
of
the
phone
can't
hear
me
very
well
so
have
to
speak
louder
aside
from
that,
these
are
perfect
and
for
the
price,
couldn't
ask
for
better
love
these
head
phones
they
are
the
best
sound
quality
amazing
stays
put
in
your
ears
perfectly
buy
won't
be
disappointed
much
love
for
these
easy
to
use,
great
battery,
great
sound
so
good
and
inexpensive
bought
spare
set
have
boltune
bluetooth
overtheear
set
of
headphones
that
use
for
recording
and
wasn't
disappointed
in
the
quality
when
saw
the
earbuds
here
on
sale,
took
chance
and
was
astounded
againthe
sound
quality,
battery
life,
and
simplicity
of
the
design
along
with
all
the
little
extras
made
this
great
product
for
any
casual
audiophile
to
invest
in
have
been
using
apple
and
dr
dre
beats
headphones
for
many
years
they
constantly
broke
and
the
battery
never
lasted
as
long
as
wanted
these
headphones
are
the
best
ones
for
the
price
have
been
using
one
for
over
months
and
just
bought
another
one
to
keep
in
my
car
as
well
battery
life
is
amazing
why
cary
case
to
charge
your
headphones
when
you
can
get
hours
of
battery
purchased
for
gym
use
and
work
really
like
the
sound
quality,
the
ability
of
how
it
blocks
out
noise
around
me
and
they
are
comfortable
very
happy
with
these
headphones
great
value
good
sound
quality,
don't
expect
too
much
on
passive
noise
cancellation
normally
will
cost
you
0+
bucks,
great
battery
life
very
happy
with
the
purchaseupdate
to
star
after
some
usage:
still
great
battery
life
but
the
main
issue
is
that
it
comes
loose
when
you
run
due
to
the
dangling
control
great
sound
and
value
for
under
$0
use
these
for
both
work
teleconference
and
for
workouts
at
the
gym
use
all
day
long,
plug
in
at
night
and
never
have
problem
with
the
battery
life
0min
charge
will
give
about
0hrs
of
play
time,
so
easy
to
plug
in
to
car
charger
on
way
to
gym
and
have
enough
battery
life
we
purchased
two
of
these,
my
wife
uses
the
other
pair
and
has
similar
positive
experience
bought
paid
to
use
to
run/workout
was
working
fine
then
one
day
wouldn't
turn
on
returned
it
and
repurchased
the
headphones
same
thing
after
uses
they
will
not
turn
on
use
earbuds
lot
wear
them
almost
all
day
at
work,
listening
to
podcasts
and
music
these
are
ok
purchased
these
when
my
other
pairs
came
up
missing
the
charge
time
is
great,
sound
is
good
fits
in
the
ear
fine
my
only
issue
with
these
is
they
are
not
as
nice
fit
as
my
other
favorite
brand,
and
have
to
manually
connect
then
almost
every
time
not
huge
deal,
to
be
sure,
but
just
don't
like
them
as
much
love
this
it
has
great
sound
quality
and
my
exercise
routines
got
much
more
fun
now
also
no
more
tickets
for
talking
on
the
phone
while
driving
giving
it
stars
only
because
when
using
the
mic,
callers
say
they
can
hear
me
too
well,
however
they
come
through
very
clear
the
noise
cancelling
and
battery
life
is
phenomenal
this
little
things
are
great
can
set
my
phone
down
to
charge,
pop
this
in,
and
walk
all
the
way
around
my
house
without
losing
the
bluetooth
connection
pretty
comfortable
to
wear
i'm
no
audiophile
but
they
sound
pretty
good
to
me
fell
in
love
with
these
headphones
usually,
avoid
using
earplugs
because
they
are
not
suitable
for
my
small
ear
canal
and
the
sound
is
confusing
these
have
smaller
earbuds
that
can
be
easily
replaced
the
sound
quality
is
very
clear
now,
don't
need
to
carry
mobile
phone
at
home
to
chat
and
listen
to
music
on
the
phone
i've
bout
three
pairs
of
these
i'm
really
rough
with
them
as
wear
them
at
work
and
get
them
snagged
but
only
destroyed
one
pair
my
fault
these
are
awesome
first
the
battery
life
is
twice
as
long
as
others
have
bought
at
even
higher
price
ranges
second
the
sound
quality
is
great
tweak
my
eq
on
my
phone
to
my
liking
and
these
are
great
wish
they
were
little
more
compact
but
then
sound
quality
would
probably
be
compromised
either
way,
no
problem
falling
out
at
work
or
the
gym
wish
battery
life
stated
was
longer
but
am
still
on
first
charge
so
not
bad
after
using
more
may
update
this
can
only
have
side
in
at
work
so
turning
stereo
sound
off
option
would
be
nice,
but
using
all
afternoon
while
weeding
flowerbeds
they
were
great
listen
to
slot
of
accapella
and
instrumental
music
and
sound
is
nice
update
battery
played
almost
continuous
hours,
off
0,
then
played
another
before
low
battery
warning
love
the
look
and
sleek
design
of
these
headphones
the
sound
quality
is
especially
good
the
bass
sound
is
very
clean
and
rich
for
earbuds
love
the
magnetic
feature
on
each
individual
earbud
so
you
can
easily
wear
the
around
your
neck
when
not
in
use
they
come
with
charging
cable
and
cute
carrying
case
too
very
happy
with
my
purchase
they
arrived
quickly,
were
packaged
well,
and
the
sound
is
great
think
will
buy
more
love
these
headphones
the
price
is
amazing
for
the
product
i'm
receiving
and
they
last
really
long
time
the
sound
is
great
most
bluetooth
headphones
i've
purchased
don't
last
more
than
two
months
but
its
been
nearly
months
and
its
still
going
strong
these
were
relatively
inexpensive
ear
buds
/
microphone,
but
they
performed
well
in
all
areas
expected
them
to
the
battery
life
is
more
than
adequate,
the
ear
buds
are
comfortable
to
wear
and
seat
well
in
my
ears,
the
microphone
picks
up
my
voice
well
the
sound
quality
is
fine,
the
controls
are
intuitive
the
bluetooth
connection
was
solid
even
when
my
phone
was
in
my
pocket
that
makes
these
my
goto
for
walk
and
phone
conversation
this
is
my
second
pair
because
wanted
one
for
my
home
and
one
for
going
out
love
them
and
recommend
them
to
my
friends
and
family
these
earbuds
are
great
for
working
out
i've
tried
running
wind
sprints
and
jumping
rope
with
no
issues
they
stay
put
personally
like
the
earbuds
connected
like
this;
for
me
they're
much
easier
to
keep
track
of
just
keep
them
around
your
neck
under
your
jacket
or
shirt,
then
pop
them
out
when
you
need
them
no
charging
case
to
lug
around
absolutely
the
best
bluetooth
headphones
have
purchased
sound
is
great
for
music
and
calls
love
the
magnet
which
helps
keep
them
around
my
neck
really
like
these
so
far
have
used
them
for
about
weeks
stars
instead
of
because
the
cord
is
little
short
for
my
rather
thick
neck
when
the
earbuds
are
not
in
my
earsupdate
april
0:
the
earbuds
stopped
charging
different
charging
cords
were
tried
the
company
was
very
responsive
and
sent
me
replacement
set
in
just
couple
days
excellent
customer
service
needed
bluetooth
headphones
that
could
last
all
day
and
wasn't
priced
crazy
these
last
all
day
long
and
more
nice
sound
quality
the
phone
microphone
works
well
magnets
help
to
ensure
they
don't
fall
off
when
work
comfortable
for
all
day
wear
love
these
have
tried
handful
of
bluetooth
headphones
and
by
far
these
have
been
what
need
for
fair
price
:
purchased
these
based
on
reviews
and
price
did
not
expect
the
sound
to
be
so
clear
listen
to
violin
music
it
is
heaven
these
are
perfect
for
my
workouts
and
conference
calls
have
magnetic
earbud
from
the
other
brand
and
needed
another
one
to
use
in
my
car
found
them
very
convenient
where
can
have
it
around
my
neck
when
not
using
plus
its
tangle
free
battery
life
for
this
headphone
is
pretty
good
too
since
use
the
headphones
very
frequently,
always
need
to
charge
them
this
one
have
the
longer
battery
life
then
my
other
headphone
pretty
much
what
expected
from
bluetooth
headphones
and
i'm
happy
with
this
purchase
got
these
headphones
on
recommendation
from
friend
about
month
ago
and
am
so
glad
did
use
them
daily
for
work
calls,
audio
books,
music
told
that
my
voice
quality
is
bit
tinny,
but
books
and
music
are
great
battery
life
was
my
biggest
factor
and
only
charge
them
when
remember
to,
maybe
every
other
day,
and
they
have
never
died
on
me
highly
recommend
these
headphones
surprisingly
good
quality
earbuds
with
such
good
price
the
sound
is
crystal
clear
the
base
is
strong
fit
in
ears
comfortably
extended
long
hours
playing
is
excellent
bought
two
other
bluetooth
wireless
earbuds
prior
but
this
one
is
the
best
satisfy
with
the
purchase
these
bluetooth
headphones
are
awesome
the
quality
and
functionality
of
these
headphones
are
really
good
they
also
sound
amazing
great
value
would
buy
again
overall,
am
very
happy
with
this
purchase
and
am
using
them
as
write
this
review
these
are
phenomenal
don
know
why
they
are
as
affordable
as
they
are,
but
seize
upon
them
would
absolutely
recommend
to
anyone
who
interested
ve
had
them
for
weekend
and
so
far,
so
good
will
update
my
review
after
couple
more
uses
really
do
love
these
headphones,
was
always
sceptical
about
switching
from
traditional
wired
headphones
to
bluetooth,
but
after
getting
these,
i'm
never
going
back
unless
must
the
battery
is
very
good
and
charges
quickly
the
sound
quality
is
excellent,
listen
to
books,
watch
movies,
television
and
listen
to
music
good
quality
comfortable
in
my
ears
very
convenient
my
only
complaint
is
they
stick
out
of
my
ears
so
can
wear
them
laying
down
on
my
side
other
than
that,
great
product
highly
recommend
them
can
workout
without
the
buds
falling
out
of
my
ears
jumping
rope
and
running
were
breeze
there
are
different
sizes
for
the
buds
which
is
helpful
since
my
canals
are
smaller
did
garden
work
without
the
fear
of
cutting
the
wire
like
my
wired
earbudsthe
sound
quality
is
better
than
expected,
although
perhaps
technically
the
sound
is
just
very
slightly
thin,
but
altogether
these
sound
pretty
good
just
received
these
headphones
and
have
been
testing
them
out
with
variety
of
music
the
first
two
things
noticed
is
the
clarity
in
vocals
and
surprising
amount
of
bass
they
feel
comfortable
but
are
noticeable
after
an
extended
period
of
time
they
don't
fall
out
when
running
or
doing
activities
so
far
i'm
excited
about
this
purchase
mainly
bought
these
for
when
mow
the
lawn
the
sound
quality
is
really
rich
like
that
three
sizes
of
earbuds
are
included
the
ear
portion
is
very
soft
apple
earbuds
hurt
my
ears
so
was
happy
to
feel
these
are
soft
thet
are
also
magnetized
so
when
take
them
off
can
stick
them
together
to
avoid
losing
them
the
sound
it
great,
the
life
battery
is
excellent
have
little
ears
and
my
husband
love
it
the
customer
service
is
exceptional
my
husband
wanted
an
extra
pair
of
bluetooth
headphones
to
keep
in
his
car
these
were
good
price
he
charges
them
in
his
car
on
the
way
to
work
with
the
included
usb
cord
he
said
they
charge
pretty
quickly
and
hold
the
charge
for
his
whole
shift
the
he
rubber
is
comfortable
and
he
says
he
barely
feels
them
while
he
wears
them
the
wrap
around
design
keeps
them
on
his
ears
while
he
works
bought
this
wireless
earbud
because
of
the
great
price,
good
reviews,
battery
life
and
short
charge
time,
have
had
it
for
week
and
all
is
good
additionally
the
sound
quality
is
tops
like
that
it
has
both
earpieces
wired
together,
if
on
falls
out
of
my
ear
it
doesn't
fall
to
the
ground
like
the
feature
that
the
earbuds
stay
together
when
stored
preventing
the
cable
between
them
from
tangling,
these
headphones
are
great
have
purchased
twice
as
gifts
for
others
but
now
back
to
finally
buy
pair
for
myself
to
replace
my
bluetooth
headphones
because
these
are
so
much
nicer
this
has
long
battery
life
and
you
can
wear
it
around
your
neck
the
whole
day
because
it
has
magnets
on
the
sidesdon't
waste
your
money
on
airpods,
get
these
the
title
says
it
all
not
only
are
they
super
comfortable,
they
clip
together
with
magnetic
which
is
cool
too
and
the
overall
sound
is
great
for
the
price
very
happy
and
will
be
buying
my
girlfriend
pair
too
my
husband
got
me
these
to
replace
my
galaxy
earbuds
which
really
did
not
like
these
are
so
much
nicer
and
easier
to
operate
never
write
reviews
but
needed
to
for
this
purchase
have
tried
multiple
wireless/bluetooth
headphones
and
have
found
these
to
be
the
best
for
the
cost
we
have
purchased
of
these
and
our
teen/tweens
love
them
too
great
sound,
love
that
they
magnetically
connect
around
your
neck
when
not
in
use,
and
they
last
all
day,
sometimes
longer
these
bt
ear
phones
are
amazing
have
had
$0+
dollar
bt
buds
and
they
were
not
as
good
as
these
super
surprised
this
is
probably
the
0th
or
0th
bluetooth
headphones
i'm
trying
because
keep
missing
the
mark
boy,
am
glad
i've
finally
found
the
solution
it
paired
with
my
iphone
in
just
seconds,
excellent
sound
quality
and
it
surprisingly
cuts
out
quite
bit
of
ambient
noise
the
extra
bass
you
feel
while
listening
to
music
is
surprising
plus
because
was
not
even
expecting
that
would
highly
recommend
it
easy
to
sync,
comfortable,
good
soundgot
it
on
sale
for
$0well
worth
it
haven
tried
them
on
an
airplane
yet,
so
only
stars
for
noise
cancellation
for
now
not
sure
how
long
the
little
rubber
cover
for
the
micro
usb
charging
port
will
last
for
waterproofness
ear
buds
stick
out
little
further
than
other
more
expensive
models
but
not
sleeping
on
my
side
with
them,
so
it
doesn
matter
very
good
product
for
the
price
ordered
these
after
my
last
$0bluetooth
headset
stopped
workingi
was
skeptical
because
of
the
low
price
on
these
but
am
very
happy
with
the
quality
of
sound,
fit,
and
battery
lifei
have
small
ears
in
the
standard
apple
earbuds
are
very
uncomfortable
but
these
fit
beautifully
and
stay
in
amazingly
wellhighly
recommend
was
bit
skeptical
about
purchasing
less
expensive
pair
of
headphones
but
was
very
surprised
great
for
my
run,
nice
sound
quality,
easy
to
use,
and
didn't
fall
out
of
my
ears
:d
i'd
definitely
recommend
it
haven't
tried
it
yet
for
higher
intensity
workouts
ie
cutting,
hiit,
or
sports
yet
hence
the
0/0
review
but
it's
fantastic
and
totally
worth
it
on
par
with
my
bose
headphones
which
were
0x
more
expensive
these
bluetooth
headphones
are
of
great
quality
they
are
magnetic
to
keep
them
together;
they
arrived
in
very
timely
manner
and
they
are
packaged
well
as
to
prevent
damage
in
shipping
the
charger
and
the
ear
pads
are
packaged
separately
with
an
instruction
booklet
will
definitely
buy
these
again
and
may
even
buy
them
as
replacement
for
some
already
have
much
better
than
my
another
wireless
headset
charged
it
for
awhile
when
got
it
then
it
played
almost
days
and
the
sound
is
clear
very
happy
with
it
love
these,
have
had
many
others
that
stopped
working
after
few
times
outwanted
to
see
how
their
did
before
gave
reviewbuy
this
set
and
you
will
hear
only
the
music
you
want
and
their
sound
greatso
happy
with
mine
wish
the
cord
was
longer
when
running
you
hear
an
echo
and
noise
cancellation
isn
the
best
they
do
work
and
have
nice
sound
battery
doesn
last
long
the
earbuds
are
really
awesome
the
sound
is
fantastic
can
enjoy
the
music
fully
while
wearing
the
headphones
they
fit
firmly
in
my
ear
and
they
never
fall
out
they
are
much
more
lightweight
than
those
headphones
have
used
they
are
easy
to
pair
and
charge
fast
the
battery
life
is
long
pretty
nice
we
have
two
phones
huawei
and
lg,
it
didn't
work
with
huawei,
but
that
might
be
the
phone
problem
since
huawei
uses
its
own
modification
of
the
android
os,
not
the
boltune
problem
works
perfectly
well
with
the
lg
phone
sound
quality
is
pretty
good
loved
the
magnets
on
the
earbuds
needs
clip
to
clip
onto
clothes
to
prevent
loss
or
damage
if
dropped
would
make
it
easy
to
retrieve
when
one
drops
out
headphones
are
loud,
with
good
sound
quality
across
it,
lengthy
battery
life,
comfortable
fit
if
you
forget
to
charge
them,
charging
them
for
mins
is
enough
to
use
them
for
good
workout
they
are
stable
and
not
falling
off
my
ear
slightly
bulky,
but
not
cumbersome
or
annoyingly
so
overall,
very
happy
with
the
product
and
its
quality,
would
buy
them
again
for
sure
this
headphone
has
great
sound,
cancels
out
the
rest
of
the
world
and
even
has
some
base
to
it
like
it
more
than
individual
earpieces
because
you
cant
lose
them
and
it
just
hangs
around
your
neck
when
your
not
using
them
got
these
for
an
xmas
gift
my
mom
had
bought
these
first
and
recommended
these
headphones
work
great
great
sound
come
with
different
sized
ear
pieces,
which
is
great
can
keep
volume
lower
b/c
outside
noise
is
greatly
reduced
like
this
product
mainly
because
resonably
good
sound
quality
at
this
price
range
0compare
to
ear
buds,
you
never
lost
one
of
side
of
it
securely
tighten
to
my
ear
and
comfortable
you
can
use
it
during
the
exercisethis
is
the
second
time
to
purchase
no
hassle
to
connect
through
bluetooth
of
your
phone
the
magnetic
connection
seems
gimmicky
at
first
but
comes
in
handy
when
carrying
this
around
my
neck
the
sound
quality
is
good
for
the
price,
and
passive
noise
cancellation
is
excellent
the
line
connecting
the
buds
is
bit
more
grippy
than
i'd
like,
as
it
catches
on
piece
of
clothing
or
skin
when
turn
my
head,
resulting
in
ome
of
the
ear
buds
being
pulled
out
of
my
ear
the
build
quality
otherwise
is
great
bought
this
headphones
for
running
it's
easy
to
use
and
it's
comfortable
and
stable
when
running
it
arrived
with
small
bag
for
packaging
it
also
has
some
backup
parts
it's
easy
to
take
when
i'm
going
out
for
running
or
other
things
these
headphones
work
well
for
the
price
good
noise
cancellation
and
overall
sound
quality
reason
for
out
of
is
that
had
issues
with
bluetooth
connection
during
zoom
calls
and
didn't
find
them
comfortable,
but
am
picky
when
it
comes
to
headphones
overall,
good
for
the
price
these
are
great
headphones
if
you
just
want
decent
set
to
use
at
the
gym
sound
quality
is
good
for
me
replaced
the
tips
with
some
comply
foam
earbud
tips
and
they're
perfect
i'd
highly
recommend
them
if
you're
looking
for
something
cheap
to
use
at
the
gym
that
will
last
you
multiple
sessions
before
recharging
these
are
great
especially
for
the
price
the
only
reason
didn
give
them
stars
is
because
didn
realize
there
isn
microphone
so
far
i'm
very
pleased
,
these
paired
quickly
and
i'm
excited
that
found
new
pair
that
has
magnets
just
received
these
headphones
and
have
to
say
they
surpassed
my
expectations
iiked
the
fit
they
were
comfortable
yet
not
to
tight
sound
quality
was
excellent
as
well
as
th
battery
life
i'm
very
pleased
with
this
product
as
well
as
getting
the
month
warranty
no
problem
hooking
them
up
to
both
my
phone
and
laptop
was
really
impressed
when
got
phone
call
while
was
listening
to
iheart
radio
on
the
laptop
also
through
the
headphones
it
automatically
cancelled
the
laptop
and
let
me
answer
the
phone
just
like
thought
it
wouldi
would
recommend
these
to
friend
and
would
also
buy
again
bought
pair
for
my
gf
for
her
birthday
and
she
loved
them
and
had
me
try
them
out
must
admit
that
was
not
expecting
the
sound
to
be
amazing
and
very
clear
really
suggest
picking
these
up
needed
bluetooth
headset
and
chose
this
one
it
was
the
right
choice
they
fit
well
in
my
ears
the
sound
quality
is
excellent
great
price
one
of
my
best
purchases
so
far
this
year
nice
product
light
and
comfortable
sound
is
good
little
tinny
when
turned
up
loud
but
over
all
good
highs
and
lows
bass
is
nice
it
washes
out
bit
depending
on
the
song
over
all
happy
with
this
product
and
at
good
price
am
very
pleased
with
these
headphones
so
far
great
sound
quality
and
battery
life
is
impressive
still
trying
to
decide
if
they
are
the
perfect
fit
for
my
ears
or
not,
but
that
is
nothing
against
the
headphones
themselves
just
have
small
ears
they
still
seem
to
stay
in
pretty
well
with
activity
and
are
comfortable
overall,
very
pleased
bought
these
headphone
couple
weeks
ago
to
have
cheap
pair
of
headphones
while
mowed
the
lawnthey
are
comfortable
and
had
been
wearing
them
around
the
house
when
needed
to
join
business
meeting
they
paired
easily
to
my
laptop
and
within
the
minute
connected
to
my
meeting
the
mic
works
great
and
the
speaker
quality
is
great
too
these
have
been
my
business
head
phones
ever
since
great
buy
like
this
bluetooth
so
far,
because
the
quality
is
not
bad
for
the
price
it
very
clear
and
loud
easy
to
control
and
function
using
the
play
and
volume
button
these
are
amazing
headphones,
especially
for
the
price
was
not
expecting
the
sound
quality
on
these
headphones,
they
compare
to
dollar
headphones
that
have
used
before
the
magnets
are
good
quality,
you
can
easily
go
from
both
ears
listening
to
one
ear
without
having
dangling
earbud
they
are
convenient
for
exercise
without
worrying
about
sweat
damage
or
having
to
fix
them
falling
off
these
are
great
for
the
price,
they
sound
just
as
good
as
my
bose
headphones
and
do
great
job
of
insulating
noise
highly
recommend
them
very
well
built,
the
quality
of
sound
honestly
surprised
me,
and
the
sound
cancelation
is
very
good
give
this
stars
for
its
versatility
if
your
looking
for
great
product
with
great
sound
and
don't
want
to
spend
an
arm
and
leg
highly
recommend
this
product
these
earbuds
have
are
now
one
of
my
best
earbuds
i've
ever
purchased
i'm
very
picky
with
my
sound
quality
since
do
work
in
very
loud
environment
airport
and
let
me
to
you
the
noise
cancelation
on
these
things
are
great
would
say
that
i'm
listening
to
some
kind
of
spokenword
media
for
nearly
half
of
my
waking
hours
and
little
music
in
addition
to
that
wanted
something
lowprofile
that
wouldn't
pinch
my
ears
or
get
in
the
way
and
these
are
pretty
good
for
that
as
small
bonus,
they're
also
relatively
good
at
blocking
background
noise
which
makes
them
useful
accessory
even
when
not
listening
to
audio
really
enjoy
these
really
simple
to
use,
sound
quality
is
pretty
good
with
decent
noise
cancellation
battery
life
way
exceeds
what
i've
needed
haven't
had
chance
to
test
the
waterproofness
of
the
product
but
tend
to
shy
away
from
mixing
water
and
electronics
regardless
of
what
is
said
do
know
my
workouts
haven't
caused
any
moisture
related
issues
though
would
definitely
recommend
the
noise
cancellation
depends
on
your
earbud
fittings
in
which
different
sizes
are
included
in
the
package
dont
like
the
wiring
though
but
overall
love
the
product
these
are
my
first
set
of
bluetooth
earbuds
am
very
pleased
with
the
sound
they
produce
for
set
under
$0
they
are
very
comfortable
and
with
the
assortment
of
ear
tips
&
ear
hooks
they
should
adjust
to
fit
anyone
love
the
amount
of
play
time
they
give
one
charge
am
happy
that
purchased
them
if
need
to
purchase
another
set
in
the
future
will
definitely
look
at
boltune
first
very
good
soundvery
good

value
i'd
recommend
to
anyoneas
good
as
previous
ones
i've
bought
costing
0x
the
amount
this
is
great
headset
very
comfortable
in
the
ear
and
great
sound
qualityit
was
easy
to
connect
to
my
iphone
via
bluetooth
it
only
took
few
seconds
i've
been
biking
for
some
time
now
to
try
to
get
in
shape
and
would
constantly
short
out
my
headphones
probably
ran
through
halfdozen
before
finally
bought
set
of
bluetooth
athletic
headphones
have
to
say,
am
very
glad
went
with
these
they're
very
comfortable,
and
the
magnetic
piece
on
the
headphones
to
keep
them
around
your
neck
when
you
aren't
using
them
is
pretty
cool
as
well
no
complaints
with
saying
quality,
noise
cancellation
or
better
life
really
like
that
they
join
magnetically
to
make
sort
of
necklace
which
keeps
them
in
place
when
you
re
not
using
them
the
ear
piece
very
comfortable
love
these
so
far
they
fit
great
and
really
glad
they
have
additional
size
earbuds
included
most
of
the
other
bluetooth
earbuds
ve
tried
just
don
fit
right
also
like
that
these
aren
the
usual,
try
to
fit
over
the
ear
phones
those
never
work
well
for
me
they
fit
great
in
my
ear
and
stay
put
totally
worth
the
buy
pleasantly
surprised
work
in
lab
so
having
set
of
earbuds
that
function
easily
and
are
easily
cleaned
with
an
alcohol
swab
are
mustthe
sound
is
great
it
has
simple
functions
and
they
fit
comfortably
in
my
earsthis
product
is
better
than
most
wireless
earbuds,
that
i've
used,
especially
for
the
price

brands,
especially
the
lows
could
be
better,
but
for
this
price
think
its
way
above
its
peers
bought
this
gift
for
my
boyfriend
for
christmas
it
arrived
on
time
it
came
with
extra
ear
piece
covers
and
nice
little
travel
bag
had
earbuds
before
but
this
one
is
the
best
i've
had
love
the
magnet
to
secure
them
around
the
neck
do
lots
of
longdistance
running,
so
have
gone
through
many
different
pairs
of
workout
headphones,
and
can
safely
say
that
so
far,
this
is
one
of
the
best
the
sound
quality
is
great
considering
the
price
and
them
being
meant
for
working
out
the
functionality
is
also
superior,
it
connects
instantly
to
my
phone
once
turned
on,
and
all
the
buttons
work
well
and
are
useful
while
running
the
sound
on
these
headphones
are
really
nice
this
product
is
definitely
worth
the
price
they
fit
nice
in
my
ears
and
the
battery
actually
lasts
really
long
a+
good
headphones

my
grandson

charge
have
been
using
these
for
about
weeks
now
and
like
everything
about
it
so
far
the
sound
is
crisp
and
has
good
bass
its
exactly
how
the
description
sayswhat
am
most
satisfied
about
is
the
battery
full
charge
it
once
and
it
lasts
for
atleast
hoursoverall
it
was
one
of
the
best
purchases
have
made
so
far
totally
worth
it
nice
product
for
the
price
the
volume
doesn
go
as
high
as
would
like,
but
it
better
than
the
other
ones
purchased
so
far
so
good,
they
fit
really
nicely
with
good
secure
feeling
and
good
seal
they
fit
very
well
under
my
motorcycle
helmet
even
though
they
stick
out
just
bit
from
the
ear
have
only
had
them
for
couple
weeks
they
were
gift
absolutely
love
them
so
far
but
the
real
test
will
be
when
working
out
and
how
well
they
last
over
time
so
far
so
good
battery
life
seems
to
be
really
long

is
louder
and
richer
than
the
others

tired

with
the
sizes

with

took
minute
to
get
used
to
that
much
material
in
the
ear
love
it
after
days
of
use
all
day
long
perfect
for
an
old
tile
setter
like
me
noise
cancelation
is
awesome
worth
every
penny
so
far
use
these
headphones
daily
since
purchase
month
ago
i'm
impressed
by
the
battery
life
they
easily
connected
to
my
bluetooth
friend
devices
they
have
clarity
for
both
voice
and
music,
and
work
well
for
phone
calls,
virtual
meetings
the
best
product
great
sound
stylish
design,
many
additional
accessories
well,
everything
is
packed
in
small
but
very
roomy
box
these
are
great
headphones
for
the
price
needed
something
to
use
on
the
go
these
stay
in
my
ear
whereas
many
others
continually
fall
out
these
stay
in
place
good
sound;
it
clear
with
no
static
buy
these
again
impressive
battery
life
i've
very
pleased
with
these
headphones
best
battery
life
of
any
i've
purchased
previously
have
used
many
different
headphones
trying
to
find
the
best
bang
for
the
buck
have
my
headphones
in
0+
hours
day
listening
to
music
and
podcasts
at
workthese
headphones
exceeded
all
my
expectations
can
honestly
say
that
these
rival
headphones
that
are
triple
the
price
best
bang
for
your
buck
these
headphones
are
little
difficult
to
charge
as
the
cord
that
comes
with
it
can
be
hard
to
get
in
the
slot
for
charging
they
are
good
overall
and
the
quality
is
good
for
what
was
paid
they
are
easily
able
to
be
connected
to
phone
the
earbud
design
is
little
weird
looking
but
does
not
impact
being
able
to
put
them
in,
listening
to
stuff,
or
anything
like
that
great
product
don't
buy
those
expressive
nonsense
these
are
great
as
good,
if
not
better
than
most
of
the
$0+
similar
headphones
don't
think
twice,
get
it
these
headphones
are
comfortable
to
wear
and
grateful
to
have
them
while
doing
so
many
meetings
remotely
they
come
with
differently
sized
ear
pieces
and
after
finding
the
right
combination
for
me,
they
fit
well
and
have
been
easy
to
use
the
raised
buttons
make
volume
easy
to
control
also
love
how
they
are
magnetic
it
helps
them
store
compactly
while
not
in
use
wow
impressed
these
are
really
comfortable
and
easy
to
use
gonna
get
my
husband
and
daughter
pair
honestly,
these
are
pretty
damn
good
for
the
price
the
sound
quality
is
surprisingly
good,
the
battery
lasts
pretty
long
on
single
charge
not
sure
exactly
how
long
though,
used
it
for
around
hours
once
and
had
only
lost
0%
battery,
and
they
fit
really
well
in
your
ear
overall,
these
are
probably
some
of
the
best
earbuds
i've
ever
purchased,
pricewise
love
these
headphones
the
battery
last
forever
even
with
all
day
use
charge
them
about
every
days
this
is
my
second
pair
because
my
husband
would
always
steal
mine
the
noise
cancellation
is
ridiculous,
in
good
way
sound
quality
is
perfection
love
these
so
much
and
love
using
them
in
the
gym
great
battery
life
and
decent
sound
quality
unfortunately
they
have
horrible
thudding
sound
when
you
take
heavy
step
so
they're
not
good
for
running
was
bit
skeptical
since
am
not
fan
of
any
earphones/earbuds,
and
usually
only
headphone
user
however,
decided
to
try
these
out
and
they
are
actually
great
there
is
no
pain
in
the
ear
after
using
them
at
all,
and
they
fit
in
my
ear
right
in
so
quickly
and
easily
the
sound
quality
is
great
for
the
price
overall,
would
recommend
these
use
these
headphones
for
walking
and
jogging
good
sound
they
stay
in
place
well
purchased
these
headphones
because
was
looking
for
reasonably
priced
wireless
option
for
travel,
running
and
outdoor
exercise
have
found
the
sound
quality
to
be
pretty
good
they
are
simple
to
use
and
suit
my
needs
have
small
ears
so
do
find
them
to
be
little
large/heavy
for
my
ear
and
they
are
not
the
most
stylish
or
minimal
looking
but
the
function
is
there
bought
this
product
for
my
friend
so
far
he
said
he
liked
it
this
is
very
easy
to
use,it
got
manual
of
several
languages
he
spanish
so
it
didn
take
much
to
figure
out
very
simple
as
it
is
sound
quality
is
good
but
he
would
prefer
something
with
more
bass
duh
but
honestly
for
how
much
you
pay,this
is
legit
he
could
use
it
when
at
the
gym
and
it
stays
in
place,too
thank
you
recived
iy
yesterday
it
is
super
excellent
quality
the
sound
is
so
clear
very
quality
,
nosie
cancellation
was
amazing
and
easy
to
connect
the
bluetooth
overall
highly
recomended
worthy
buying
it
am
happy
customer
so
my
powerbeats
wireless
headphones
needed
replacement,
but
wanted
to
spend
less
money
this
goaround
for
some
workout
headphones
after
using
these
for
two
months
now
daily,
they
are
awesome
they
cancel
out
noise,
play
high
quality
sound
and
also
last
multiple
days
would
recommend
these
to
anyone
who
listens
to
music
/
podcasts
for
few
hours
day
and
/
or
during
workouts
these
headphones
have
very
crisp
sound
when
using
for
phone
conversation
you
hear
the
person
very
well
and
they
can
hear
you
worked
fine
for
three
months,
then
stopped
charging
but
company
was
quick
to
offer
replacement
which
works
well
great
for
the
money
little
in
the
heavy
side
long
battery
life
bought
and
gift
this
product
to
my
little
cousin
it
got
the
same
design
as
the
beats
that
got
lot
cheaper
too
and
my
little
cousin
really
loves
it
was
surprised
because
the
sound
quality
and
the
noise
cancellation
is
not
bad
at
all
compared
to
other
product
in
the
same
pricerange
super
easy
to
set
up
with
my
iphone
sound
quality
is
great
love
them
price
was
awesome
absolutely
recommend
bought
these
in
feb
purchased
cause
of
battery
life
is
hrs
they
are
not
charging
the
red
light
goes
off
like
they
are
charged
then
the
voice
in
the
earbuds
say's
"low
battery"
love
them
so
far,
very
good
battery
life,
love
that
it
comes
with
varying
sized
attachments
neat
little
carrying
bag
too
that
didn
expect
used
taotronics
previously
which
loved
but
sweaty
dude
when
workout
and
the
taotronics
kept
breaking
giving
these
guys
shot
but
off
the
initial
first
week
into
it
bought
these
headphones
for
ease
of
working
from
home
so
was
not
tied
to
my
computer
with
cord
the
battery
life
has
been
excellent
and
have
no
complaints
about
the
sound
would
recommend
these
to
anyone
looking
for
good
quality
pair
of
headphones
at
an
affordable
price
the
sound
is
great
am
very
happy
with
the
quality
it
also
came
with
lot
of
extra
of
those
plastic
things
for
the
ear
bud
part
they
are
different
shape
than
ones
normally
see
so
that
was
an
awesome
thing
to
include
the
magnets
that
stick
the
ear
buds
together
for
storage
is
nice
and
strong
too
over
all
great
quality,
especially
for
the
price
charged
as
soon
as
received
and
i'm
thirteen
hours
into
my
first
use
and
just
now
hitting
0%
power
left
have
immersed
myself
in
some
high
bass
music
all
day
and
have
completely
forgot
about
the
world
around
me
you
will
not
regret
this
purchase
three
bud
and
hook
sizes
included
so
you
will
find
comfortable
fit
bass
:
this
is
an
excellent
earbud
for
running
have
tried
several
others
witless
bluetooth
without
cord,
and
once
you
sweat
few
times
they
stop
working
this
one
has
passed
the
sweat
test
it
is
also
very
comfortable
and
don
notice
wearing
it
the
earbud
is
very
soft
and
nonirritating
thank
you
the
left
earbud
did
not
work
out
of
the
box
after
several
rounds
of
back
and
forth
with
the
customer
service
they
expected
to
me
provide
my
own
box
to
post
the
broken
earbuds
before
they'd
replace
them
complete
waste
of
time
for
cheap
pair
of
chinese
earbuds
these
headphones
are
very
comfortable
and
they
cancel
out
the
sound
perfectly
they
are
just
what
was
looking
for
for
the
price
they
are
sold
at
only
been
using
daily
for
months
now
battery
life
is
impressive
and
easily
outlasts
full
hour
workday
if
they
last
full
months
ill
be
more
than
satisfied
they
do
seem
sort
of
fragile
but
time
will
tell
got
these
so
could
work
out
and
listen
to
music
these
are
so
convenient,
with
there
being
only
one
wire
to
connect
the
headphones
it
makes
it
easy
to
not
lose
them
and
also
get
them
from
falling
on
the
floor
if
one
falls
out
of
your
ear
the
quality
is
great
and
the
sound
is
awesome
can
hardly
hear
anything
around
me
when
have
them
in
definitely
worth
it
the
best
set
of
bt
ear
buds
i've
had
over
the
years,
it's
been
lotpaired
easily
when
connecting,
the
voice
messages
are
clear
fit
is
excellent
have
yet
to
fall
out
of
either
ear
comfortable
sound
quality
is
good,
but
only
use
them
for
phone
calls
not
music
magnetic
clasp
powerfulthey're

would
buy
again
wife
uses
them
every
day
for
work
very
satisfied
with
them
these
are
the
best
bluetooth
headphones
have
owned
good
sound
quality,
very
good
battery
life,
good
user
interface
love
the
size
and
fitment
very
comfortable
and
remarkably
secure
in
my
ear
my
wife
will
be
ordering
set
despite
claims
of
sweat
and
water
resistance,
ran
into
issues
almost
right
away
with
sweat
getting
in
the
control
unit
it
started
with
the
volume
down
button
being
constantly
"pressed"
by
sweat,
and
now
they
won't
turn
on
at
all
usually
run
for
minutes
at
time,
and
these
barely
lasted
weeks
of
0x
per
week
of
running
these
headphones
are
truly
amazing
they
cancel
out
noise
without
having
to
blast
my
music
the
battery
life
is
also
exceptional
like
having
the
freedom
of
being
able
to
walk
away
from
my
phone
and
have
the
music
project
the
distance
portrayed
by
the
details
of
the
product
would
definitely
buy
these
for
friend
also
great
that
is
sweat
proof
because
workout
each
day
just
tried
out
my
headphones
in
running
workout
and
the
sound
quality
was
amazing
the
most
important
aspect
that
liked
about
the
headphones
is
that
it
fit
in
my
ear
and
didn't
fall
out
through
my
run
the
headphones
do
great
job
of
cancelling
out
the
noise
around
me,
which
is
important
when
you're
running
around
traffici
would
highly
recommend
purchasing
this
headphone
perfect
good
quality
clear
voice
and
ready
to
use
for
long
time
before
changing
thanks
very
simple
setup,
pairing
was
no
problem
have
using
on
both
samsung
and
apple
phones
like
the
controls,
well
laid
out
and
easily
accessible
use
primarily
for
audio
books
so
really
can't
comment
on
the
music
aspect
like
the
magnetic
backs
which
grab
each
other
and
help
with
storage
hanging
the
sound
quality
is
far
superior
than
my
previous
pair
of
course
that
could
be
the
size
because
even
the
small
is
huge
noise
cancellation
is
okay,
if
you
have
it
loud
enough
and
battery
has
lasted
me
days
with
walking
at
work
and
exercising
at
home
as
in
battery
level
hasn
moved
yet
these
are
very
easy
to
use
and
set
up
so
comfortable
in
the
ear
easy
off
and
on
very
reasonably
priced
good
sound,
nice
features
but
the
charge
does
not
last
hours
as
stated,
but
it
does
give
you
plenty
of
audible
warning
when
the
charge
is
getting
low
just
charged
up
and
wow
these
things
make
apples
air
pods
drown
in
the
water,
amazing
sound
and
quick
pairing
these
little
things
have
transformed
my
workouts
love
being
wireless
they
stay
on
and
don
fall
off
sound
is
great
and
the
battery
lasts
an
amazing
amount
of
time
use
these
things
daily
working
out,
doing
chores
or
just
listening
to
music
got
these
to
go
on
run
they
connected
my
iphone
fine
but
in
two
weeks
of
sweaty
running,
they
gave
up
ll
spend
more
and
just
get
namebrand
product
owned
these
for
four
months
and
the
right
earbud
became
more
quiet
than
the
left
earbud
before
this,
these
headphones
were
astonishing
for
their
pricei
emailed
boltune's
customer
service
through
amazon
we
attempted
to
troubleshoot
them
over
email
after
this
failed,
they
immediately
sent
me
brand
new
pair
of
earbuds
with
zero
hasslei
recommend
these
these
headphones
are
so
comfy
and
produce
great
sound
also
appreciate
that
the
wire
connecting
the
earbuds
is
the
perfect
length
so
it's
not
swinging
around
during
your
workout,
and
the
mic
is
still
close
to
your
mouth
easy
to
use,
good
quality,
and
has
warranty
to
boot
highly
recommend
wire
thicker
than
previous
pair,
rubs
neck,
o/w
great
have
to
say,
ve
tried
other
brands
of
earbuds
and
these
are
by
far
the
best
ones
ve
ever
owned
it
blacks
out
other
sounds
to
the
point
not
allowed
to
have
both
buds
in
my
ears
at
work
because
can
hear
my
phone
or
anyone
talking
to
me
personally
don
see
the
problem
lol
battery
is
long
lasting
and
the
price
is
great
definitely
buy
these
again
quality
is
great
too
this
is
my
third
pair
and
love
it
also
they
gifted
me
with
gift
card
and
going
to
use
it
to
order
an
extra
pair
in
case
lose
these
like
always
do
the
sound
on
these
is
good,
can
hear
lyrics
that
never
made
out
before
balance
is
pretty
nice,
although
may
eventually
upgrade
to
headphones
that
can
be
fine
tuned
more
feel
heavy
in
the
hand
but
barely
noticed
them
while
running
quick
to
connect
in
bluetooth
and
easy
controlswould
recommend
as
budgetfriendly,
active
headphone
option
bought
these
and
love
them
the
bass
is
deep
and
rich
the
treble
is
clear
and
crisp
they
last
long
time
on
charge
and
are
very
comfortable
to
wear
this
headphones
are
very
light,
it
feels
made
from
really
good
quality
components
and
fits
perfect
into
my
ears
sound
quality
is
amazing
"for
the
price",
the
bass
line
is
very
powerful,
even
at
low
volume
levels
the
mid
and
high
ranges
sound
could
be
better,
because
it
feels
little
far
"like
in
second
plane",
because
of
strong
bass
sounds,
nothing
that
you
can
fix
with
rock
equalizer
preset
;
great,
rich
sound
for
it's
class
little
bottom
heavy,
but
robust
the
mic
works
fine,
but
sometimes
is
iffy
on
phone
calls,
especially
where
the
mic
can
end
up
behind
your
neck
pretty
easily
sound
is
good
noise
cancellation
is
good
but
it
keeps
disconnecting
and
when
you're
on
call
the
other
party
can't
hear
you
these
headphones
have
solid
battery
life
and
good
sound
overall,
good
value
like
more
bass
in
my
headphones,
abs
touch
more
volume
couldn
hurt
fits
well
for
me,
and
typically
have
trouble
finding
comfortable
headphones
great
for
price
my
mother
in
law
wanted
earphones
that
wouldn't
fall
from
her
ears,
that
have
great
sound
quality,
and
great
battery
lifethese
earphones
are
perfect
for
her
and
exceeded
her
expectations
was
disappointed
that
the
earbuds
used
to
have
were
no
longer
available,
so
decided
to
try
boltune
version
was
immediately
impressed
with
how
easily
they
connected
to
my
devices
my
only
slight
disappointment
is
the
fact
that
they
are
bit
heavier
than
the
ones
that
am
used
to
but
all
in
all
am
very
pleased
with
this
product
connected
easily
with
my
phone
via
bluetooth
and
sounds
good
work
in
cube
farm
and
it
did
cut
down
on
noise
from
the
colleagues
near
me,
there's
always
one
colleague
who
defies
sound
cancelling
capabilities
overall
i'm
pleased
with
the
purchse
thank
for
taking
care
of
my
problem
so
efficiently
this
is
my
favorite
brand
great
sound
quality,
easy
and
quick
bluetooth
hookup
sound
great,
easy
to
use
and
charge
the
magnets
keep
them
around
your
neck
when
not
in
use
the
fit
is
reasonable
with
the
bud
covers
and
wings
more
selection
would
be
better
m/l
and
xl
awesome
wireless
earbuds
they
paired
right
away
with
my
phone,
sound
great
and
fit
comfortably
without
falling
out
can't
beat
it
for
the
price
came
in
the
box
fully
charged
easy
to
pair
and
sound
quality
on
par
with
my
much
higher
priced
pair
best
battery
life
ve
seen
on
bluetooth
product
for
my
taste
the
cord
could
be
inches
longer
but
still
very
usable
disappointing

lifewill
buy
again
have
to
say
was
exspecting
some
cheap
earbuds
oh
was
wrong
they
are
made
really
nice
not
heavy
easy
to
function
sounds
really
good
am
really
happy
with
them
and
my
next
pair
will
be
of
higher
model
to
see
what
else
they
have
to
offer
love
it
and
keep
up
the
good
work
thank
you
the
headphones
are
excellent
they
have
great
sound
quality
and
they
are
stable
in
my
ears
while
running
and
exercising
they
re
great
for
taking
on
run
or
workout,
and
they
last
for
quite
long
time
so
you
don
have
to
worry
about
running
out
of
power
during
long
periods
of
use
battery
life
is
great,
and
they
get
the
job
done
for
their
purposethese
bluetooth
earbuds
are
solid
for
the
price
great
product
over
all,
the
only
issue
have
with
it,
is
that
it
doesn't
automatically
shut
off
after
not
playing
music
for
while
didn't
realize
left
it
on
through
the
night
and
the
battery
completely
drained
other
than
that
complaint,
everything
else
functions
fine
prefer
the
corded
wireless
ear
buds
better
than
the
buds
that
come
separate
can
never
seem
to
keep
them
secured
in
the
ear
and
am
always
adjusting
them
to
try
and
keep
them
in
with
the
cord
can
also
have
them
hang
over
my
neck
when
not
in
use
the
magnetic
ends
make
me
feel
even
more
satisfied
they
click
together
and
stay
in
place
until
i'm
ready
to
go
again
these
are
great
headphones
and
exactly
what
was
looking
for
i'm
not
too
terribly
picky
about
sound
quality
but
these
exceeded
my
expectations
the
battery
life
has
been
excellent
as
well
the
magnetic
connecting
between
the
two
ear
pieces
is
great
addition
overall,
very
satisfied
with
this
purchase
especially
at
such
great
price
these
are
really
good
earbuds
the
bateery
life
last
for
=
hours
dont
have
to
woory
about
them
dieing
fast
also
they
have
magnet
on
the
end
of
them,
love
it
when
im
not
useing
them
can
clip
the
around
my
necklike
necklece
the
best
headphone
for
your
buy
we
just
ordered
more
pairs
after
my
daughter
stole
the
pair
already
had
they
work
great,
wear
them
for
spartan
races
and
they
hold
up
great
even
with
the
water
obstacles
fabulous
sound
quality
bought
as
gift
for
my
husband
he
was
absolutely
blown
away
by
how
crystal
clear
the
sound
is,
picking
up
all
the
instruments
being
played
will
be
buying
myself
pair
bought
for
my
yr
old
grd
daughter
she
likes
themi
liked
the
fact
that
they
were
magnetized
so
can
slip
off
neck
would
recommend
these
to
anyone
love
them
the
battery
life
is
great
does
last
two
whole
days
of
work
the
fit
in
my
small
ears
and
have
extra
ear
pieces
sound
is
good
comes
in
case
to
travel
with
great
product
these
were
fantastic
for
the
first
use
then
they
never
recharged
again
was
pretty
bummed
these
have
nice
sound
more
sound
canceling
than
had
expected
they
stay
in
your
ears
when
running,
but
the
sound
bar
pulls
slightly
with
weight
when
moving,
but
easily
fixed
with
knot
on
the
opposite
side
finally
have
pair
of
wireless
ear
buds
that
fit
and
are
secure
while
working
out
must
have
very
small
ear
canals
so
these
help
keep
them
in
my
ears
can
speak
on
battery
life
as
just
got
them
today
wow
great
product
i've
had
other
bluetooth
earphonesthese
are
the
bestprice
and
quality
are
top
notch
got
for
christmas
to
listen
to
my
audio
books
gets
hours
and
hours
of
play
connects
to
phone
effortlessly
every
time
sound
is
great
and
love
the
magnetic
connection
to
keep
them
on
my
neck
when
between
use
love
the
magnetic
closure
around
my
neck,
it
ensures
they
won't
fall
off
bluetooth
connection
was
super
easy
they
fit
snug
in
my
ears
and
won't
fall
out
these
are
great
would
totally
recommend
the
sound
and
fit
of
these
are
amazing
used
them
for
full
day
and
the
battery
was
still
alive
and
well
left
stars
for
battery
simply
because
don't
have
the
long
term
experience
to
judge
them
after
many
uses
for
very
reasonable
price
you
cannot
go
wrong
with
these
headphones
got
these
to
use
at
the
gym
they
are
easy
to
use
and
haven
had
to
charge
them
like
that
they
have
the
magnets
so
you
can
keep
them
around
your
neck
when
not
using
and
not
lose
them
earbuds
work
well
with
iphone
and
windows
computer
some
hiss
at
higher
volumes
so
will
limit
use
to
voice
rather
than
music
if
intending
to
use
for
music
consider
this
these
are
really
nice
set
of
earphones
they're
easy
to
work,
and
came
with
several
different
sized
rubber
ends
for
the
earbuds
interchangeable
good
quality
and
straightforward
they're
not
usually
the
kind
of
wireless
earphones
normally
use
so
don't
know
how
long
i'll
use
them
for,
but
knew
that
when
got
them
compared
to
other
earbuds,
this
set
feels
little
cheaper,
but
quality
is
good
for
daily
used
earbuds
very
good
headphones
glad
switched
over
after
some
lessthanideal
headphones
that
while
lasted
longer
had
very
poor
quality
definitely
worth
the
price
great
battery
life,
great
sound
quality,
sound
cancelling
is
perfecto
its
pretty
good,
sounds
good
and
is
pretty
decent
length
love
to
use
them
while
watching
netflix
in
my
bed
the
sound
quality
of
the
headphones
are
great
it
doesn't
fully
cancel
noise,
but
it
does
pretty
decent
job
for
the
most
part
really
do
enjoy
the
long
battery
life
on
them
when
compared
to
other
bluetooth
headphones
overall,
great
product
for
the
priceedit:
so
nice,
had
to
buy
it
twice
wife
really
enjoyed
using
them
so
had
to
purchase
one
for
myself
have
been
enjoying
them
so
far
love
my
boltune
headphones
unfortunately
my
old
ones
quit
working
after
about
yrs
of
wearing
them
everyday
funny
if
you
look
in
my
timeline
photos
you
can
see
them
on
my
neck
in
every
photo
after
yrs
they
stopped
connecting
to
my
bluetooth
it
the
greatest
design
very
comfortable
to
wear,
nice
bass
and
even
treble
so
nice
order
twice
am
enjoying
these
very
comfortable
headphoneslongest

great

this
little
guy
works
good
and
sounds
great
does
exactly
what
needed
thank
you
these
worked
great
until
after
running
out
of
power
the
first
time,
they
never
turned
on
again
they
are
part
of
my
desk
clutter
nowupdate:
boltune
offered
to
replace
them,
they
worked
great
otherwise,
and
would
buy
this
brand
again
when
need
more
headphones
this
pair
of
wireless
earbuds
is
the
first
product
that
has
fit
my
ear
they
are
comfortable,
light,
and
they
are
easy
to
usepairing
was
simple
since
use
them
to
listen
to
news
and
audio
while
walking
can't
really
say
what
they
are
like
while
running
great
product
at
nice
price
point
at
this
point
give
them
start
rating
easy
to
use
great
sound
stays
in
ears
even
during
running
and
other
activities
prefer
the
connected
ear
bud
design
to
individual
ear
buds
much
lower
cost
than
most
alternative
products
at
this
price
point,
not
so
concerned
with
loss
or
accidental
damage
as
with
much
more
expensive
product
was
hesitant
to
purchase
at
first
due
to
the
lower
price,
however
pleasantly
surprised
at
the
quality
sound
is
good
and
they
stay
in
my
ears
when
running
would
definitely
recommend
to
another
these
have
great
sound
quality
and
block
out
almost
all
surrounding
noise
almost
to
fault
prefer
to
be
able
to
hear
my
surroundings
they
come
in
nice
case
and
are
ready
to
use

several
workouts

excellent
they
arrived
in
few
days
and
have
been
using
them
ever
since
didn't
know
why
they
are
magnetic
but
do
now
since
the
fit
comfortable
around
my
next
and
the
magnets
lock
the
earbuds
together
so
they
stay
put
and
are
ready
for
an
incoming
call
or
to
listen
to
music
really
wanted
to
like
these
for
the
price
but
everyone
talk
to
tells
me
they
cannot
understand
word
say
on
the
phone
they're
probably
okay
for
music
listening
very
impressed
with
the
price
and
quality
of
the
earphones
really
nice
sound
and
very
comfortable
to
wear
would
definitely
recommend
really
enjoy
these
headphones
i've
been
using
them
for
about
month
now
and
the
sound
quality
is
great
and
the
fit
nicely
in
my
ears
and
are
not
bulky
feeling
or
uncomfortable
the
magnetic
feature
on
the
back
of
each
ear
piece
is
also
super
convenient
for
when
working
out
with
friend
and
you
need
to
pop
the
ear
buds
in
or
out
goes
to
pairing
mode
everytime
press
power
botton
it
is
really
nice
earphone
for
exercise
and
the
package
is
simple
with
very
nice
bag
for
store
so
far
the
sound
is
great
will
keep
using
for
while
and
see
the
battery
so
far
so
good
pleasure
purchase
so
far
nice
value
was
looking
for
pair
of
bluetooth
earbuds
that
would
stay
in
my
ears
comfortably
for
long
runs
am
female
with
small
ears
and
often
have
trouble
fitting
into
earbudsthis
pair
comes
with
three
sizes
to
adjust
the
fit
of
the
buds
the
smallest
set
seems
to
do
the
trick
for
my
ears
really
like
this
item
because
of
sound
quality,and
battery
life
is
amazing
this
is
phenomenal
product
be
sure
to
read
the
instructions
on
the
button
commands
battery
life
is
amazingly
long
and
lives
up
to
the
promised
hours
super
good
after
comparing
with
other
more
expensive
wireless
good
sound
for
the
price,
haven't
run
into
issues
with
the
battery
life
so
far
but
haven't
used
it
too
much
comfortable
and
convenient
these
are
my
0nd
pair
lost
the
other
one
recently
the
battery
life
lasts
forever
and
the
sound
quality
is
great
two
work
buddies
recommended
these
boltune
headphones
they
told
me
the
bass
is
solid
and
sound
overall
very
good
they
said
the
battery
life
is
incredible
you
can
listen
for
an
entire
hour
shift
and
still
have
more
than
0%
battery
left
noise
cancellation
is
good,
but
we
work
in
wood
shop,
so
expectations
are
high
still
say
the
cancellation
is
good
bough
these
for
friend
of
mine
who
goes
to
the
gym
sound
was
good
and
bass
was
satisfying
during
training,
sweat
did'nt
seem
to
have
any
effect
on
product
earbuds
worked
even
when
phone
was
few
meters
away
without
having
disconnection
issue
the
reviews
on
these
seemed
positive
but
after
about
week
of
using
them
started
to
get
bunch
of
background
static
it
caused
my
ears
to
hurt
after
using
them
for
more
than
mins
so
ended
up
returning
them
exactly
what
expected,
nice
comfortable
bluetooth
headphones
with
amazing
base
and
sound
balance;
not
to
mention,
the
packaging
came
with
well
written
instructions
plus,
didn't
know
these
headphones
could
pair
to
two
devices
honestly
these
headphones
are
amazing
have
had
no
issues
with
them
thus
far
they
feel
comfortable
after
long
hours
of
wear,
the
battery
also
does
last
for
hours
and
lastly
they
sound
great
very
happy
with
earbuds
so
far
excellent
battery
life
previously
had
the
bluetooth
wrap
around
the
ear
beats
by
dre
and
these
are
better
no
cap
for
how
cheap
these
are,
they
are
steal
do
landscaping
and
cut
grass
for
work
and
you
cannot
even
hear
the
mower
or
anything
when
these
are
on
and
you
only
need
them
at
half
blast
have
never
used
these
at
maximum
volume
because
so
good
really
like
these
headphonesthey
are
beautifully
packaged
and
just
the
right
sizeit's
signal
is
stable
and
the
sound
quality
is
clearlong
continuous
playback
allows
me
to
enjoy
wonderful
music
during
travel
and
sportsthe
main
thing
is
that
the
waterproof
effect
is
very
good,i
like
it
too
muchoverall,they
are
really
good
value
for
money
and
well
worth
buying
i've
only
had
these
few
days,
but
i've
been
impressed
with
the
quality
for
the
price
mainly
wear
them
while
walking
the
dog
and
have
been
surprised
by
the
noise
cancelling
feature
they
pretty
much
block
out
the
ambient
street
noise
they
fit
well
and
seem
to
have
good
battery
life
haven't
used
them
on
phone
call
yet
love
these
headphones
the
battery
life
is
amazing
have
been
using
them
lot
since
got
them
and
haven
had
to
charge
them
yet
they
are
very
comfortable
in
your
ears
and
the
magnetic
quality
helps
your
from
losing
them
highly
recommend
these
comfortable
product
as
described
good
value
for
price
purchased
these
in
march,
and
they
worked
pretty
well,
except
they
would
cut
out
once
in
while,
but
today
the
sound
coming
out
of
the
left
side
stopped
completely
would
expect
this
product
to
last
at
least
year
very
disappointed
and
won't
purchase
again
headphones
worked
great
for
the
first
couple
months
battery
life
has
decreased
quite
bit
since
then,
but
customer
service
offered
replacement
for
free
bought
this
for
my
0yr
old
and
she
loves
it
great
for
trips
in
the
car
when
you
don't
want
to
hear
the
music
or
game
they
are
playing
on
their
devices
they
stay
in
her
ears
perfectly
and
the
battery
life
seems
great
and
no
long
extra
wires
to
contend
with
with
attached
ear
buds
christmas
gift
so
we'll
see
how
she
does
with
them
so
far
so
good
these
headphones
replaced
some
from
another
brand
that
loved,
but
broke
unexpectedly
thought
i'd
try
these
ones
based
on
the
good
reviews
and
haven't
been
disappointed
they
sound
so
much
better
than
my
old
pair
and
are
more
comfortable
to
wear
too
highly
recommend
these
for
the
price
great
headset
and
great
sound
quality
definitely
recommend
these
headphones
last
forever
they
never
fall
out
of
your
ears
like
others
have
tried
in
the
past
love
them
so
much
bought
another
pair
in
case
lost
my
other
pair
works
great,
bought
as
replacement
for
similar
headphones
stay
in
the
ears
when
running
and
sound
good
bought
pair
and
was
very
impressed
with
sound
and
battery
life
they
are
comfortable
to
wear
unlike
other
ear
buds
have
had
liked
them
so
much
that
ordered
another
pair
after
misplacing
the
original
pair
wasn't
sure
if
the
earbud
insert
would
be
comfortable
and
firm
fitting,
but
these
are
excellent
in
both
features
the
inserts
set
in
very
securely
and
have
very
soft
comfortable
feel
extra
connection
and
earmount
parts
were
included;
suppose
that
they
might
wear
out
or
need
replacing
eventually
love
these
headphones
the
quality
is
great
when
have
them
in,
can't
hear
any
other
noise
it
cancels
out
all
noise
the
sound
is
very
reach
and
clear
love
the
magnet
feature
also
they
came
with
several
size
ear
pieces
and
carrying
bag
really
great
and
the
price
was
great
was
looking
for
wireless
earbuds
that
would
provide
decent
sound
and
stay
in
place
while
running
/
working
out
this
product
met
all
of
my
expectations
they
are
comfortable
and
always
stay
in
place
sound
is
very
good
controls
are
straightforward
and
conveniently
accessible
ve
now
bought
two,
and
am
very
pleased
with
the
purchase
what
like
about
this
set
of
earbuds
is
that
they
are
all
what
the
product
description
said
they
were
can
you
believe
less
than
$0
would
buy
again
and
recommend
them
to
anyone
who
are
looking
for
good
set
of
earbuds
great
sound,
comfortable,
the
control
piece
and
microphone
are
too
close
to
earpiece
and
the
buttons
are
not
raised
up
to
figure
out
without
seeing
them
also,
microphone
easily
faces
away
from
voice
and
is
too
soft
volume
to
listener
at
the
other
end
in
the
price
range,
these
sound
very
good,
although
have
not
to
hade
the
chance
to
really
test
the
battery
life
they
do
last
an
entire
day
without
problem
haven't
actually
let
them
fully
discharge
the
mic
quality
is
good
based
on
feedback
from
call
had
these
head
phones
are
durable
battery
life
is
extraordinary
buy
with
confidence
these
are
absolutely
wonderful
superior
sound
quality
and
comfort,
and
easy
to
use
would
say
these
are
comparable
to
jaybirds
will
be
telling
my
friends
about
these
best
buy
for
the
money
0%
great
fit,
great
sound
these
replaced
my
beats
and
they're
just
as
good
excellent
quality
find
i'm
in
love
i've
been
searching
for
headphones
to
use
while
bike
most
bluetooth
headsets
are
boxy,
so
they
catch
the
wind
and
create
so
much
noise
have
hard
time
hearing
while
bike
but
these
nest
in
my
ear
and
block
the
exterior
sound
and
they're
super
comfortable
i've
been
using
them
for
almost
three
days
and
they
still
have
battery
life
these
earbuds
are
great
for
listening
to
music
they
have
great
sounding
speakers
and
fit
right
in
your
ear
if
they
don't
fit
in
your
ear,
they
also
include
ear
tips
and
hooks
along
with
the
earbuds,
as
well
as
bag
for
the
earbuds
these
earbuds
are
great
overall
pick
and
the
price
helps
too
love
the
way
that
they
fit
sound
quality
is
great
will
definitely
buy
again
would
recommend
to
other
users
best
headphones
i've
had
in
while
battery
lasts
awhile
too
bought
these
blue
tooth
ear
buds
so
that
would
be
hands
free
with
my
phone
love
the
long
battery
life
and
how
well
they
work
find
the
controls
on
the
neck/ear
connectorcord
bit
awkward
to
use
when
using
the
ear
buds,
so
use
the
controls
on
my
phone
instead
love
that
it
comes
with
different
ear
size
heads,
and
little
mesh
bad
to
keep
it
all
together
didn't
try
it
for
long
time,
but
the
sound
is
amazing
,
completely
isolating
the
noise
from
the
outside,
feeling
like
at
the
concert
lol
definitely
will
order
again
as
gift
to
the
family
btw
came
in
days
really
like
the
headphones
used
them
for
hours
straight,

these
another
shot
and
i'm
so
glad
did
they
are
the
best
earbuds
i've
ever
had
sound
great
they
are
loud
enough
and
don't
slip
from
my
ear
when
run
these
do
decent
job
of
keeping
sound
from
the
outside
out
and
it
is
easy
to
pair
with
different
devices
stayed
in
during
my
first
run
and
sound
good
others
bought
had
the
tips
fall
off
during
run
and
were
hard
to
change
connection
between
devices
love
love
love
these
headphones,
this
is
the
second
time
buys
these,
lost
my
first
ones
had
them
over
year,
was
so
upset
the
sound
quality,
battery
life,
noise
cancelation
is
allll
great
i'll
try
to
be
more
careful
with
these
the
product
broke
within
months
and
emailed
the
company
and
they
sent
new
pair
i'm
grateful
for
their
fast
service
and
confidence
in
their
product
love
these
headphones
second
pair
have
bought
from
them
battery
life
is
pretty
accurate
perfect
for
long
work
hours,
or
for
long
trips
love
how
they
are
magnetic
and
stay
connected
if
have
them
hanging
around
my
neck
quality
is
great
recommend
them
to
anyone
who
like
the
wired
bluetooth
headphone,
they
do
not
reconnect
to
my
iphone
when
turn
them
off
and
back
on
have
to
forget
the
device
on
my
phone
then
pair
them
again
this
is
the
first
pair
have
ever
had
that
have
to
go
through
this
process
love
these
they
stay
well
in
ears
and
fit
well
magnetic
feature
is
great
sound
is
good
easy
to
pair
easy
to
charge
great
purchase
within
the
first
few
weeks
the
left
ear
bud
starting
going
out
and
had
lot
of
static
if
didn't
use
them
for
few
days
they
wouldn't
turn
on
and
had
to
charge
again
boltune
quickly
resolved
it
by
sending
out
free
pair
of
updated
headphone
to
resolve
the
issue
it
was
greatly
appreciated
saw
lot
of
reviews
and
they
were
right
these
headphones
cancelled
out
noise
and
was
the
most
impressed
by
how
well
they
stayed
in
my
ears
have
little
ears
so
had
to
use
the
small
earpieces
but
the
wings
are
so
comfortable
and
they
stayed
in
my
whole
workout
these
stay
in
my
ears
during
workouts
and
the
sound
is
great
would
recommend
these
bought
these
to
connect
to
my
garmin
0m
they
sound
great
and
have
long
battery
life
have
already
worn
the
headphones
running
in
colorado
hail/rainstorm
and
they
are
definitely
waterproof
as
well
can't
speak
to
the
durability
so
far
as
have
only
had
them
few
weeks,
but
am
very
confident
they
will
last
long
time
amazed
at
how
well
these
stay
in
the
ear
comfortable
as
well
love
the
magnetic
feature
when
not
in
use
noise
cancellation
is
very
good
as
well
sound
seems
bit
bass
heavy,
but
good
enough
for
the
price
got
these
for
my
husband
he
absolutely
loves
them
he
said
the
battery
lasts
long
time
which
he
needs
because
he
uses
them
all
day
at
work
he
also
says
they
are
very
comfortable
which
is
big
deal
to
him
he
usually
hates
wearing
headphones
he
thinks
should
order
myself
pair
next
am
runner
and
very
hard
on
headphones
typically
look
for
bluetooth
connectivity,
long
battery
life,
and
ability
to
withstand
sweat/rain/snow
for
the
price,
these
are
great
in
all
honesty,
better
than
many
more
expensive
ones
that
i've
purchased
over
the
years
nothing
fancy,
but
definitely
get
the
job
done
these
earbuds
are
great
sound
is
good,
but
would
like
to
add
touch
of
base
as
sometimes
the
music
sounds
little
off
extra
ear
piece
sizes
make
this
wonderful
for
each
individual's
needs
these
wireless
buds
are
amazing
great
clarity,
comfortable,
they
send
different
size
buds
to
pick
your
fit
would
definitely
recommend
this
product
stable
transmission
so
far
so
good
and
don't
have
any
complaints
for
this
because
it
is
so
awesome
it
doesn't
bring
me
issues
at
the
moment
and
truly
enjoy
using
it
during
my
leisure
time
hasslefree
love
these
headphones
great
battery
life,
comfortable,
nice
sound,great
price
and
love
the
magnetic
attachment
when
not
in
use
hanging
around
my
neck
they
stay
together
all
around
great
quality
and
price
been
using
for
nearly
month
excellent
sound
quality,
range,
battery
life
and
price
walk
to/fro
work
and
find
myself
leaving
my
boltune
headphones
in
for
while
instead
of
turning
the
stereo
on
when
get
home
these
are
so
comfortable
and
the
ear
clips
are
amazing
have
bought
many
different
wireless
headphones
and
these
are
the
best
sound
is
awesome
and
battery
life
is
great
all
in
all
am
very
happy
with
my
purchase
received
these
headphones
and
came
fully
charged
and
easy
pairing
noise
cancellation
is
good
but
the
sound
quality
is
not
that
great
good
earbuds
for
the
price
packaged
well
and
good
sound
very
comfortable
and
stay
in
ears
well
it
was
easy
to
connect
with
my
cell
phonei
usually
used
it
for
running
and
it
fit
to
me
and
didn't
falling
off
the
earalso
the
sound
quality
was
very
satisfactory
made
of
magnetic
design,
it's
easy
to
carry
don't
have
to
worry
about
twisting
the
lines
liked
these
headphones
so
much
bought
another
pair
just
one
little
thingthe
cover
for
the
usb
attachment
is
pretty
flimsy
and
the
cord
provided
is
pretty
short
guess
that's
two
things
otherwise,
sound
quality
is
good,
price
is
reasonable,
very
happy
they
are
good
for
reasonable
pricesound
quality
and
battery
life
are
both
great
clear,
clean
sound
unlike
other
headphones
in
this
price
range,
the
base
sounds
solid
comfortable
fit
no
reason
to
spend
for
more
expensive
headphones,
these
do
nicely
just
love
the
clarity
of
the
earphone
it
holds
on
to
the
ear
very
welli
once
had
bose
earphones
and
this
came
close
to
it
will
be
buying
more
of
their
products
had
problem
with
this
set
and
they
promptly
replaced
it
working
from
home
while
the
"stay
at
home
order"
is
in
effect
needed
some
bluetooth
headphones
for
my
increasing
number
of
conference
calls
these
have
great
battery
life
and
the
noise
canceling
is
very
good
my
only
challenge
is
that
sometimes
hear
just
bit
of
static
but
overall
for
the
price
these
are
great
great
headphones
considering
the
price
point
battery
life
is
superb
running
is
easy
to
wear
the
sound
quality
is
good,
and
i'm
not
afraid
to
lose
it
finally
pair
of
earbuds
that
are
comfortable
they
sound
really
good
when
listening
to
music
i've
received
feedback
from
others
that
the
microphone
sound
quality
is
also
very
good
when
use
these
for
conference
calls
ordered
these
for
my
little
sister
because
her
old
earphones
broke
she
loves
these
because
they
have
noise
cancellation
system
and
the
battery
life
is
spectacular
so
she
doesn
have
to
put
them
on
charge
every
other
hour
or
so
sound
quality
on
these
is
also
great
did
lot
of
research
for
the
best
first
time
product
for
new
bluetooth
user
and
also
compared
many
specifications
ie
distance
for
connectivity
and
battery
life
after
month
of
using
it,
thought
it
was
great
everyone
should
give
this
product
at
least
one
time
try
have
bought
few
pair
of
these
headphones
listen
daily
in
the
shower
and
use
frequently
while
traveling
for
work
good
sound
quality,
quick
to
connect,
good
range,
good
battery
life,
however
have
had
the
microphone
stop
working
on
pair
which
eliminates
the
ability
to
use
on
phone
call
or
online
meeting
these
are
the
best
love
that
they
stay
put
in
my
ears
without
looping
around
the
top
of
my
ears
where
my
glasses
go
they
have
great
sound
volume
and
clarity
use
them
during
exercise
with
no
problems
am
glad
purchased
them
am
so
happy
with
this
purchase
these
headphones
are
super
comfortable
and
stay
securely
in
place,
which
is
important
because
use
them
while
running
they
deliver
clear
sound
and
the
volume
controls
are
easily
accessible
am
considering
gifting
these
to
friends
and
family
once
they
fully
charged
they
are
awesome
they
come
with
different
size
buds
to
fit
to
you
and
most
importantly
they
stay
securely
in
place
bought
this
because
was
tired
of
my
old
headphone
wires
always
getting
caught
and
pulled
on
objects
the
sound
quality
isn
terrible,
but
sometimes
get
dull
fuzzy
static
sound
the
wire
also
keeps
moving
to
one
side,
which
can
be
annoying
since
it
has
to
be
adjusted
this
is
the
second
pair
my
husband
has
gotten
and
he
wears
them
all
the
time
if
it
wasn
for
my
grandson
the
other
ones
would
still
be
working
this
wireless
headphone
has
relatively
good
sound
quality
considering
its
cheap
price
power
charging
is
convenient
and
blue
tooth
connection
is
easy
to
set
up
the
magnet
in
the
back
makes
two
headphones
stick
together
so
the
wire
doesn't
twist
great
gift
spend
many
hours
on
calls
during
the
day
and
these
earbuds
have
made
my
life
much
easier
since
i've
started
using
them
can
leave
my
phone
in
one
place
and
walk
around
the
house
with
no
signal
problems
the
mic
quality
is
good
too
would
recommend
them
nice
price
love
the
sound
and
noise
canceling
and
that
they
actually
stay
in
my
ears
ve
tried
many
and
they
don
usually
stay
out
great
price
only
negative
is
the
wire
and
not
sure
if
turn
them
off
the
magnets
are
great
feature
if
uoh
take
them
off
and
wear
around
your
neck
this
wireless
bluetooth
headset
has
fast
transmission
speed,
stable
signal
and
clear
sound
quality
the
sound
quality
is
very
good
when
listening
to
music
it
is
comfortable
to
wear
it
can
be
played
continuously
for
hours
after
charging
minutes
you
can
also
listen
to
your
favorite
music
when
running,
which
will
not
affected
by
sweat
and
rain
don't
worry,
they
work
like
my
new
headphones
lot
love
these
headphones
was
looking
for
wireless
set
that
could
use
while
working
out
and
these
did
not
disappoint
once
put
the
largest
earpieces
on,
they
held
firmly
even
while
running
battery
life
seems
great
and
sound
quality
is
surprisingly
good
for
the
price
if
these
broke,
wouldn
hesitate
to
reorder
another
pair
love
these
battery
last
for
days
perfect
for
riding
on
the
motorcycle
good
sound
could
be
little
louder
but
clear
sound,
wellbuilt
and
the
battery
lasts
long
timei
use
them
daily
for
outdoor
work
and
they
are
great
at
canceling
noise
these
headphones
are
good
for
workouts,
especially
running
the
sound
quality
is
good
and
they
connect
seamlessly
to
my
phone
via
bluetooth
out
of
the
wireless
headphones
have
bought
in
the
past,
would
say
these
are
on
the
upper
end,
given
their
price
this
was
random
order
to
try
out
something
new,
and
was
pleasantly
surprised
how
fantastic
these
sound
charged
em,
went
out
for
few
runs
this
week,
they
stay
in
the
ear
comfortably,
and
the
trebles
are
crisp
and
bass
is
clear
and
bassy
just
as
it's
intended
buy
these
an
amazing
deal
excelente
was
very
sad
when
lost
my
first
pair
of
boltunes
so
promptly
ordered
another
have
hard
time
with
headphones
because
they
often
fall
out
of
my
ears,
especially
during
exercising
these
fit
well
even
when
sweaty
and
are
easy
to
pair
and
use
highly
recommend
especially
for
the
reasonable
price
the
ear
buds
are
fantastic
once
you
put
then
in
you
no
longer
hear
the
outside
world
the
sound
quality
is
great
for
the
price
range
love
the
magnetic
clip
for
when
i'm
taking
break
then
can
take
them
out
and
they
basically
become
necklace
really
nice
great
sound
stays
charged
for
long
period
of
time
have
been
using
mine
for
couple
of
weeks
now
and
am
very
happy
with
them
they
are
user
friendly
&
good
battery
life
work
much
better
than
different
brand
that
had
tried
there
was
one
earhook
that
was
bent/curved
too
much
but
it
comes
with
other
pair
so
just
switched
and
worked
fine
recommend
these
connected
to
my
phone
and
laptop
quickly
and
easily
works
with
both
very
well
necessary
in
the
teleworking
mode
pauses
and
restarts
music
with
the
click
of
button
both
recorded
and
youtube
great
tool
for
work
or
entertainment
like
the
headset,
stick
outside
the
ear
and
get
bumped
sometimes
good
sound
this
is
my
third
pair
lost
the
last
pair
and
keep
coming
back
to
them
they're
an
allaround
good
pair
of
headphones
they
sound
great,
noise
cancelling
is
great,
and
the
battery
lasts
whilewould
recommend
them
these
have
great
sound
and
great
battery
life
the
only
downside
find
to
them
is
that
they
don
fit
my
ears
as
comfortably
as
would
like
and
start
to
hurt
after
or
so
hours
otherwise
they
would
be
five
stars

the
price

few
months

price
just
got

so
can't
much
else
other
than
they
seem
lot
like
my
old
taotronicswhich
really
liked,
but
with
better
materials
also
the
magnets
seem
lot
snappier
and
are
quite
satisfying
bought
these
for
my
boyfriend
and
his
son
loved
them
so
much
that
bought
him
pair

great
sound

for
our
gym
workouts
good

immediately
out
of
the
boxperfect
for
my
exercise
walks
they
are
very
secure
and
comfortable
not
as
much
bass
as
would
prefer
but
for
the
price
and
purpose
wanted
these
are
great
watch
tv
in
bed
while
others
sleep
good,
loud
sound
battery
good
for
nights
great
product
have
been
using
these
headphones
since
over
past
months
regularly
for
my
office
calls
as
well
as
for
listening
to
call
while
running
or
working
out
sound
quality
is
good
and
convenient
for
regular
use
came
with
power,
connected
just
fine
what
expect
for
the
price
the
magnets
are
little
weak,
and
one
of
the
ears
dud
things
fell
off
while
was
wearing
it
around
my
neck
the
first
day
super
comfortable
great
sound
love
the
look
and
feel
of
them
great
value
highly
recommend
purchased
months
ago
no
sound
in
right
ear
their
customer
service
pulled
thru
and
made
sure
my
problem
got
resolved
even
tho
was
beyond
the
warranty
period
love
mine
and
it
has
bass
not
as
bulky
of
wire
than
my
other
one
was
so
more
comfortable
and
stays
in
my
ears
better
too
usually
hate
inear
headphones,
but
these
very
comfortable
to
wear
and
the
package
comes
with
different
earbud
sizes,
use
the
smallest
and
they
work
fantastic
the
audio
is
crisp
and
precise
am
not
an
audiophile,
but
these
headphones
really
sound
great
they
charge
quickly
and
find
can
use
them
for
about
hours
before
need
to
recharge
them
great
soundproof
buds
that
for
well
in
your
ears
love
these
so
far
so
good
am
hard
of
hearing
so
things
usually
sound
muffled
these
earbuds
help
tremendously
on
phone
calls
and
while
listening
to
music
they're
also
pretty
comfortable
this
is
tremendous
value
this
headset
works
much
better
than
the
one
had
before
that
cost
twice
as
much
very
comfortable
and
sound
quality
is
excellent
can't
recommend
these
enough
gave
star
on
battery
but
not
totally
confirmed
these
have
more
bass
than
my
not
near
as
cheap
headset
lost
my
first
set
on
cross
country
trip
immediately
ordered
another
pair
they
are
awesome
their
charge
lasts
for
days
and
was
able
to
drive
from
colorado
to
minnesota
straight
through
hours
while
listening
to
music
and
talking
on
the
phone
without
charging
love
these
headphones
like
that
they
stay
in
place,
sound
is
good,
they
do
what
need
them
to
do
my
first
set
broke
right
away,
but
now
with
the
great
customer
service
they
are
making
it
right
great
set
of
wireless
headphones
for
the
price
i'm
impressed
with
these
earphones
great
sound
quality
and
ability
to
block
out
background
noise
seem
to
be
durable
as
well
good
value
for
the
price
the
only
reason
that
didn't
provide
stars
is
the
tendency
of
the
right
earbud
to
come
out
of
my
ear
while
run
i've
resisted
purchasing
bluetooth
headphones
but
after
upgrading
my
smartphone
no
longer
had
headphone
jack
setup
was
easy
charge
has
held
up
packaging
was
very
nice
and
the
magnets
on
the
headphones
make
it
easy
to
packup
and
store
this
is
the
0nd
time
ordering
this
product
in
the
last
month
was
negligent
while
hiking
and
lost
them
off
the
trail
several
days
later
found
them
in
tall
brush
having
been
in
days
of
wet
weather
and
ice
they
worked
just
as
good
as
when
purchased
them
so
now
have
pair
your
browser
does
not
support
html0
video
it
is
my
first
time
bought
the
blue
tooth
headphones,the
battery
life
is
good,one
time
charge
can
last
many
daysand
the
looking
is
my
favorite
style
alsoi
love
this
product
all
around
very
good
headphone
easy
set
up
and
works
great
sounds
is
very
crisp
&
clear
good
bass
like
the
pouch
that
holds
the
earbuds
and
the
extra
sizes
of
buds
easy
to
pair
very
happy
with
my
purchase
also,
quick
delivery
high
stereo
quality
it's
so
satisfying
for
its
quality
and
the
price
is
much
lower
the
craftsmanship
is
not
really
poor
for
this
and
have
lot
of
affection
for
this
huge
satisfaction
for
it
recommended
have
tried
several
kinds
of
wireless
headphones,
including
airpods,
and
like
these
the
best
by
far
the
sound
is
great,
the
battery
lasts
forever,
and
don
worry
about
losing
them
like
do
the
air
pods
but
also
if
did,
they
re
so
inexpensive
to
repurchase
highly
recommend
trying
them
they're
light,
sound
quality
is
pretty
good,
have
great
battery
life,
and
the
inner
ear
hooks
are
comfymy
biggest
complaint
is
when
use
them
to
run/exercise,
the
mic
part
is
heavy
and
bounces
around
next
to
your
face,
making
it
kind
of
irritating
not
enough
to
want
to
return
them
the
headphones
are
but
the
that's
annoying
about
this
product
is
everytime
turn
on
these
headphones
have
to
program
it
to
the
phone
everytime
it
supposed
to
be
programmed
once
not
every
time
used
the
headphones
it
my
be
defective
use
these
for
work
where
leave
them
on
for
roughly
0+
hours
using
them
sporadically
yet
the
battery
has
never
died
on
me
the
sound
range
and
quality
is
great
especially
for
the
price
accidentally
threw
the
first
pair
got
away
and
did
not
hesitate
to
purchase
them
again
comfortable
in
ears
and
fit
securely
battery
charges
quickly
and
easy
to
use
the
magnets
are
great,
since
often
forget
have
headphones
around
my
neck
so
far
so
good
just
got
it
few
days
ago
and
love
it
so
far
just
received
these
headphones
and
was
surprised
by
the
quality,
both
of
the
headphone
materials
and
the
sound
quality,
both
of
which
you
can't
beat
for
this
price
great
earbuds
for
the
right
price
good
overall
sound
quality,
including
deep
bass,
good
battery
life,
and
the
mic
is
clear
and
crisp
for
phone
calls
also
like
the
strong
magnets
on
the
buds
which
let
me
wear
around
my
neck
when
not
using
so
can
quickly
insert
if
receive
call
these
headphones
are
good
value
for
the
price
they
stay
in
my
ear
don
hurt
my
ear
when
wear
them
for
hours
am
using
them
for
phone
calls
the
people
am
talking
to
can
hear
me
clearly
the
volume
on
my
side
is
good
with
them
in
both
ears,
they
do
good
at
dampening
the
background
noise
behind
me
very
comfortable
fit
they
stay
put
reasonably
well
despite
their
weight
which
like
bass
and
overall
sound
is
very
good
bluetooth
range
is
excellent
my
only
criticism
is
the
constant
faint
white
noise
only
notice
it
when
there's
no
sounds
playing

during
audiobooks

be
disappointed
friend
recomended
these
headphones
to
me,
and
my
am
glad
to
have
purchased

more

than
the
apple
airpods,
and
love
and
they're
connected
so
they
don't
get
lost
definitely
must
for
anyone
looking

amazing
battery
life
reliable
reception
and
sound
long
battery
life
and
quick
connection
great
product
the
bluetooth
connection
is
very
solid
i've
used
them
running,
doing
housework,
and
yard
work
even
if
my
phone
is
not
on
me,
but
just
nearby,
they
stay
solidly
connected
the
magnetic
ends
that
keep
them
around
your
neck
after
you
take
them
out
of
your
ears
is
very
helpful
feature,
also
use
them
all
the
time
the
range
is
pretty
bad,
but
the
battery
is
amazing,
they
charge
quick
and
are
cheap
as
hell
worth
it
to
me
comfortable
fit
perfect
for
workouts
earbuds
fit
nicely
in
the
ear
without
being
uncomfortable
love
these
headphones
the
battery
lasts
all
day
and
the
sound
quality
is
on
par
with
headphones
those
twice
the
price
or
more
the
bluetooth
pairing
works
very
simply
and
has
decent
range
recommend
these
to
anyone
looking
for
an
affordable,
high
quality
product
ve
purchased
few
of
these
but
this
one
doesn
hold
battery
charge
for
more
than
minutes
so
disappointed
fully
charged
it
out
of
box,
did
all
things
ve
done
before
would
not
buy
again
not
recommend
very
impressed
with
both
the
sound
quality
and
battery
life
the
battery
especially
was
nice
surprise
lasts
much
longer
than
other
wireless
headphones
i've
had
there
was
minor
issue
with
the
audio
sync
on
my
first
pair
customer
service
was
extremely
quick
and
responsive
and
sent
me
new
pair
right
away
very
impressed
with
their
support
love
these
headphones
the
sound
quality
is
great
and
the
option
of
different
ear
bud
pieces
is
perfect
for
noise
cancellation
and
finding
the
perfect
fit
love
the
magnetic
piece
so
can
easily
take
them
out
of
my
ears
if
needed
and
do
not
loose
them
definitely
recommend
these
headphones
really
are
great
great
sound,
amazing
battery
life,
month
warranty,
and
quality
materials
am
pretty
picky
about
sound
quality
and
these
headphones
have
been
pleasant
surprise
for
the
money,
can't
imagine
you
can
do
much
better
highly
recommend
these
were
my
first
pair
of
bluetooth
earphones
i've
since
bought
few
others
and
these
are
still
the
easiest
to
deal
with
to
me
they're
almost
hard
to
lose,
they
dont
need
case,
and
the
battery
life
is
great
consistently
decent
sound
quality
was
so
sick
of
buying
expensive
name
brand
headphones
like
bose
and
beats
just
to
have
them
crap
out
on
me
these
are
so
comfortable
and
easy
to
setup
the
sound
is
good
and
the
battery
lasts
long
time
would
definitely
recommend
these
love
them
i'll
be
using
them
for
my
upcoming
trip
really
good
wireless
headphones
have
been
using
them
for
two
months
and
had
no
issues
with
them
they
connect
to
the
bluetooth
really
easy
and
have
really
good
microphone
the
only
downside
is
the
microphone
also
takes
background
noise
the
battery
last
for
at
least
three
days
when
constantly
use
them
i've
had
these
few
weeks
and
they
work
great
easy
to
pair
with
my
phone,
quality
sound,
and
easy
to
use
like
the
magnetic
feature
so
don't
lose
them
when
they're
around
my
neck
too
really
loved
these
headphones
but
they
died
on
me
after
only
months
not
sure
what
went
wrong
but
they
won
power
back
on,
even
though
the
charging
light
comes
on
when
plug
them
in
aside
from
that,
for
the
price
they
had
great
sound
and
volume
cancellation
have
lawn
care
business
and
used
these
when
was
mowing/weedeating
today
and
they
were
amazing
usually
go
through
several
headphones
per
mowing
season
but
these
are
amazing
and
highly
recommend
them
do
not
anticipate
having
to
buy
anymore
after
the
great
quality
saw
today
these
headphones
were
recommended
to
me
when
was
looking
at
really
expensive
wireless
headphones
so
glad
went
with
these
because
they're
perfect
even
had
my
mom
and
brother
purchase
pair
so
far
all
is
good
have
not
been
running
with
it
sound
great,
the
mesh
draw
string
bag
is
great
to
protect
it,
very
good
sound
quality
stays
in
my
ears
during
my
workouts
and
the
battery
life
is
great
amazing,
best
ever
had
they
did
not
fall
out
when
went
on
run
easy
to
use,
like
the
magnet
that
links
them
they
sound
good
and
still
could
hear
cars
passing
by
which
like
when
am
jogging
switched
the
ear
pieces
to
the
smallest
and
it
was
pretty
easy
to
change
them
they
are
very
comfortable
to
wear
and
good
sound
arrived
on
schedule
right
out
of
the
package
had
terrific
sound
quality
adjustable
ear
pieces
allow
for
comfortable
and
secure
fit
these
are
my
go
to
earbuds
for
working
out
and
long
runs
these
are
well
built
i'm
impressed
by
the
sound
quality
like
this
headset
it
so
easy
to
use
and
has
very
good
quality
and
price,
too
the
magnets
are
plus,
so
can
close
them
on
my
neck
when
don
use
them
i'm
enjoying
the
boltune
bluetooth
headphones
also
love
that
they
came
day
early
thanks,
amazon
if
could
change
one
thing
about
this
device,
it
would
be
to
make
the
section
of
wire
behind
the
neck
little
heavier
so
it
does
not
move
around
so
much
other
than
that,
am
loving
them
trusted
and
bought
by
the
user
reviews
and
it
was
absolutely
right
it's
easy
to
set
up,
it
sounds
great,
and
it
has
great
microphone
the
instructions
are
written
in
different
languagesthis
is
very
valuable
product
at
this
cost
absolutely
love
these
earbuds
they
have
great
battery
life,
good
sound,
are
comfortable
to
wear,
and
connect
very
quickly
to
paired
devices
really
like
the
comfortability
in
my
tears
sound
quality
is
above
average
and
haven't
had
them
go
dead
on
me
in
an
hour
shift
call
me
use
them
at
work
as
truck
driver
for
music
and
to
make
phone
calls
to
my
customers
great
item
sleep
with
these
they
are
great
did
order
these
again

am
disappointed
that

of
months

first
pair

not
charge
now,
bought
late
may
and
will
not
charge
early

de
muy
buen
sonido

totalmente
recomendable
am
very
satified
with
my
boltune
bt
headphones
they
are
easy
to
connect
and
the
battery
is
longlasting
used
them
outside
on
long
walks
and
my
calls
are
clear
even
on
rainy
days
don't
leave
the
house
without
them
replacing
my
old
bluetooth
headphone
due
to
battery
no
longer
holding
the
charge
gave
this
one
try
and
it
exceeds
my
expectation
no
problem
with
pairing
my
phone
and
the
sound
quality
is
way
better
in
this
price
range
the
phone
calls
are
clear
too
no
regret
about
this
one
looking
for
reasonably
priced
bluetooth
headphones
that
would
stay
in
my
earsthese
do
just
thata
plus
that
they
are
waterproofeasy
to
pair
via
bluetooth
good
bluetooth
headphones
for
the
money

comfortably
in
my

and
don
fall
out
when
working
out
ve
worn
them
in
the
shower
to
see
how
water
proof
they
are
have
not
had
any
issues
the
headphones
sound
wonderful
and
fit
snuggly
in
my
ears
haven't
tried
running
with
them
yet,
but
think
they
will
stay
in
my
ears
nicely
overall,
the
quality
seems
sufficient,
and
would
recommend
these
to
others
ive
had
the

it
is
solid

and
simple
up
and
down
for
volume

master
button
for
pause/call

array
of
extra
rubbers
aswell,
nice
that
when
not
in

they
have
magnets
on
the
back
and
stick
together
rather
than
flap
around
these
little
wireless
ear
buds
exceed
my
expectations
for
work
in
the
office
it
is
comfortable
to
wear
in
one
ear
as
well
as
both

lasted
couple
days
now
with
no
recharging
and
bluetooth

was
simple
great
headphones
ve
had
really
hard
time
find
pair
of
headphones
that
actually
stay
in
my
ears
when
run
and
think
ve
finally
found
pair

you
can
sell

to
get
the

was
skeptical
because
have
been
burned
in
the
past
with

blown
away
by

battery
life
these
are
exactly
what
was
looking

this
price
point
is
worth
every
dollar

star
rating
the
sound
is
good,

no
issues,
but
would
watch
out
for
putting
it
on
the
loudest
volume
setting,
it's
not
all
that
great
but
at
this
price
point

boltune
so
far
love
my
boltune
wireless
earbuds
the
earbuds
themselves
are
magnetic,
so
it
helps
it
from
twisting
together
it
came
with
multiple
options
for
the
earbuds
itself,
which
like
bc
in
case
loose
one
or
if
the
current
selection
is
uncomfortable
so
far
i'm
liking
my
new
buds
am
quite
pleased
with
the
quality
of
these
am
also
very
pleased
with

with
an
inexpensive

great
headphones

stays
in
my
ears
the
product
is
great
quality,
gave
these
as
present
and
decided
to
buy
another
pair
for
myself
this
is
great
product,
low
cost,
durable
battery
and
amazingly
crisp
and
reliable
audio
must
have
headphones
are
super
lightweight
everything
feels
quality
and
sounds
very
high
quality
would
recommend
to
anyone
for
$0
bucks
good
price
for
this
bluetooth
headphones
love
that
while
running
or
exercising
or
any
kind
of
big
movement
they
don't
fall
which
is
big
one
for
me
love
the
pouch
it
comes
with
to
store
them
they
are
not
heavy
at
all
so
you
hardly
even
notice
them
easy
to
pair
with
my
phone
my
girlfriend
has
these
headphones
and
am
always
borrowing
them
because
love
how
secure
they
are
when
running
also
love
the
magnetic
feature
so
you
can
hang
them
around
your
neck
without
fear
of
them
falling
off
work
as
expected
use
these
with
my
tv
transmitter
receiver
it
pairs
easily
&
works
well
especially
like
the
voice
notifications
really
loved
these
headphones
good
audio
quality,
really
effective
noise
canceling,
but
one
earbud
stopped
working
after
months
like
the
magnets,
and
how
they
hold
in
my
ears
the
bass
is
decent
easy
to
setup
and
use
thanks
:
this
product
was
easy
to
pair,
charges
fast,
fits
great,
sounds
awesome
and
very
pleased
with
my
purchase
can
use
these
for
over
0hrs
talking
on
the
phone,
listening
to
music
and
still
have
over
half
battery
at
the
end
if
the
night
for
$0
wasn't
expecting
much
but
they
sounded
very
good
voices
in
songs
were
very
clear
only
issues
had
was
the
bass
was
slightly
muddy
but
hardly
noticeable
at
lowere
level
feel
good
and
solid
went
to
charge
these
after
run
and
came
back
to
the
smell
of
burning
and
melted
plastic
turns
out
the
headphones
were
melting
highly
doubt
these
are
anything
resembling
ipx0
and
definite
hazard
to
keep
around
bought
these
as
christmas
gift
to
my
son
who
is
rather
forgetful
so
the
tethered
together
feature
works
well
they
fit
his
ears
well,
he's
yrs
old
everything
good
so
far,
great
price
in
case
he
loses
them
so
far,
so
good
this
bluetooth
headset
is
solid
and
the
sound
is
great
using
it
as
hands
free
device
works
well,
the
battery
life
seems
good
have
not
ran
out
of
battery
time
while
using
it
and
the
magnetic
part
the
ear
piece
has
great
use
was
concerned
about
the
quality
of
$0
headphones,
but
these
complete
with
other
pairs
paid
$0+
for
the
bass
these
things
put
out
is
much
better
than
would
have
guessed
the
wire
isn't
as
thin
as
thought
and
should
last
long
time
highly
recommended
product
these
headphones
feel
like
$0
headphones
to
me
they
are
better
than
my
bose
especially
great
for
those
that
are
runners,
working
outside,
any
activities
have
never
had
any
problems
with
them
falling
out
great
headphones
these
headphones
are
amazing
the
sound
quality
is
superb
and
the
battery
life
is
long
as
someone
who
travels
often,
these
are
the
perfect
headphones
lightweight
and
well
made,
i'd
recommend
them
to
anyone
the
headphones
were
good
value
for
the
money,
but
lasted
less
than
months
before
becoming
unusable
they
no
longer
charge
when
plugged
in
and
thus
became
useless
also,
difficult
to
figure
out
how
to
contact
the
seller
for
replacement
or
refund
most
amazing
one
great
performance
is
the
first
stuff
what
got
favored
very
much
no
nasty
noisy
stuffs
and
the
songs
could
be
listened
in
clear
way
great
price
is
the
second
one
got
me
satisfied
in
general
it's
an
advantageous
deal
for
me
the
sound
was
terrific
was
pleasantly
surprised
at
the
built
quality
the
right
ear
just
wouldn't
stay
in
otherwise,
terrific
product
these
headphones
feel
sturdy
like
how
the
magnets
keep
them
together
when
not
in
use
can
easily
listen
to
music
on
my
phone
while
on
the
lawnmower
or
treadmill
must
say
that
if
you
are
looking
for
cheap
really
good
quality
earphones
this
is
what
you
want
to
buy
the
noise
cancellation
is
really
good
and
finally
can
workout
withiut
hearing
the
gym
music
as
well
as
my
songs
bought
as
gift
for
my
boyfriend
no
complaints
and
he
seems
to
enjoy
using
them
over
the
cord
earbuds
now
say
it
worth
the
price
bought
these
wireless
earphones
for
my
daughter
she
is
runner
and
really
liked
the
boltune
they
are
comfortable
and
have
good
sound
quality
they
also
stay
in
your
ears
well
while
running
would
definitely
recommend
initially
loved
these
they
cancelled
outside
noise
and
had
great
sound
quality
but
the
sound
quality
just
went
downhill
after
sweat
in
them
during
workout
super
disappointed
very
happy
with
these
headphones
very
comfortable,
while
staying
in
my
ear
unlike
other
earbuds
on
three
mile
walk,
did
not
have
to
adjust
once
sound
quality
is
good
and
microphone
quality
seems
good
as
well
i'd
recommend
this
purchase
soo
must
have
gotten
glitch
on
my
first
wireless
ear
buds,
seller
reached
out
to
me
and
sent
me
replacement
am
throughly
pleased
with
the
quality
and
amazing
sound
am
experiencing
now
thank
you
for
standing
behind
your
product,
very
happy
these
headphones
are
great
they
stay
in
my
ears
while
running
and
working
out
at
the
gym
quality
sound
for
quality
price
great
value
for
the
money
these
earbuds
are
awesome
for
exercising,
they
stay
in
place
and
are
light
weight
would
definitely
get
these
again
these
synced
very
easily
to
my
phone
and
the
sound
quality
is
great
chose
these
because
of
price
and
the
magnetic
closure
so
don
lose
themm
and
they
had
good
reviews
really
liked
these
earbuds
the
sound
is
great,
but
they
don't
fit
well
in
my
ears,
so
had
to
return
them
really
wanted
them
to
work,
because
they
seem
to
be
great
quality
and
not
terribly
expensive
great
headphones
that
actually
stay
in
your
ear
i've
always
had
problem
with
headphones
falling
out
and
these
are
great
really
like
these
they
are
super
comfortable
and
work
great
left
ear
dead
in
year
wire
seems
brokengood
battery
life
while
alive
for
the
price
that
paid,
these
are
the
best
bluetooth
earbuds
ve
owned
runner,
and
the
sweat
was
no
issue,
and
the
earbuds
stayed
in
my
ear
and
sound
great
highly
recommend
like
them
they
seem
to
be
ok
thanks
so
far
so
good
haven't
had
any
problems
with
battery
life
and
to
my
admittedly
untrained
ear
the
sound
quality
is
fine
no
problems
with
regular
amount
of
wetness
from
heavy
rain
or
sweat,
haven't
tried
using
in
the
pool
though
loved
the
first
pair
bought,
but
eventually
they
don't
hold
charge
the
first
pair
lasted
few
months,
the
second
barely
has
lasted
two
weeks
disappointing
because
the
first
pair
had
was
impressive
until
all
this
excelente
sonido,
fácil
de
conectar,
liviano
conveniente
sistema
de
imán
para
asegurarlo
these
were
gift
for
my
adult
kids
and
they
both
love
these
ear
buds
they
say
the
sound
quality
is
awesome
and
so
is
the
call
quality
we
would
buy
them
again
the
appearance
is
good,
the
sound
quality
is
also
very
good,
it
can
be
used
for
sports
or
going
out,
and
it
is
waterproof
boombest
bluetooth
buds
by
boltuneyeeeeaaaaa
love
these
are
everything
wanted
for
fraction
of
the
cost
runner
and
needed
something
lightweight
and
that
wouldn
fall
out
of
my
ears
with
the
impact
of
movement
these
are
perfect
great
battery
life
as
well
as
sound
quality
highly
recommend
recently
wore
these
in
an
airport/on
plane
they
were
fairly
comfortable,
slipped
out
of
the
ear
bit
on
one
side
but
overall
not
bad
fantastic
sound
quality
they
are
not
really
noise
cancelling
but
they
are
far
sight
better
than
the
ones
previously
had
so
i'm
happy
with
them
really
nice
pair
of
headphones,
especially
for
the
price
light
weight,
good
sound,
solid
and
comfortable
fit
and
long
battery
life
all
in
all
great
pair
of
headphones
the
sound
is
really
good,
but
not
fantasticbut
what
did
you
expect
for
this
price
point
i've
been
using
these
headphones
interchangeably
from
my
cellphone
to
my
computer
and
the
transitions
are
so
simple
they
are
comfortable
and
the
battery
lasts
long
time
i'm
very
happy
with
my
purchase
this
is
exactly
what
was
looking
for
good
quality,
light,
comfortable
earphones
that
won
brake
the
bank
ve
had
them
for
week
now
and
couldn
be
happier
bought
two
good
at
noise
cancellation,
long
battery
life
they
both
work
great
but
wire
between
ear
buds
needs
to
be
little
longer
to
go
around
the
neck
of
real
person
would
buy
again
though
love
how
they
cancel
all
the
noise
around
you
and
you
can
focus
on
the
music
your
listening
to
,
the
battery
life
is
amazing
and
they
fit
very
comfortably
don
have
any
complaints
might
end
up
buying
second
pair
to
give
to
friend
good
quality
sound
for
the
price
love
these,
but
when
connect
them
have
to
forget
the
device
everytime
then
turn
off
the
bluetooth
and
on
again
and
search
for
new
devices
otherwise
it
an
amazing
product
good
quality
this
is
my
second
boltune
earphone
and
can
see
improvement
in
this
model
it
fits
well
in
ear,
sound
quality
and
battery
life
is
good
these
headphones
are
perfect
ride
motorcycle
and
like
to
be
able
to
answer
my
phone
or
listen
to
music
while
i'm
riding
and
these
are
perfect
for
that
very
quick
shipping
too
definitely
would
buy
again
these
are
good
headset
and
come
with
few
different
sized
tips,
which
is
nice
first
product
didn
work,
but
great
customer
service
and
they
sent
me
replacement
pair
noise
cancelling
is
so
good
have
to
keep
one
earbud
out
while
wearing
at
work
battery
life
is
better
than
expected
the
quality
is
what
would
expect
from
much
pricier
item
my
favorite
part
is
the
battery
life
these
headphones
work
great
for
my
year
old
to
run
with
he
had
trouble
with
other
headphones
not
staying
in
his
ears
these
probably
could
fit
little
better
which
is
why
only
gave
stars,
but
the
fact
they
stay
in
while
he
runs
is
win
comfortable
sound
quality
for
media
and
music
is
decent
more
importantly,
audio
is
clear
and
crisp
on
calls
battery
life
is
impressive
lasting
the
entire
day
for
me
so
overall
these
headphones
do
not
disappoint
comfortable
and
decent
sound
quality
not
bad
for
the
price
only
use
it
for
audio
books,
it
works
great
customer
service
was
amazing
to
work
with
they
quickly
solved
my
problem
by
sending
replacement
replacement
works
great
with
teenagers
these
get
misplaced
often
and
will
definitely
be
buying
these
again
am
enjoying
these
so
far
use
them
for
running
really
like
they
magnet
together
so
they
stay
around
me
neck
when
they
are
not
in
my
ears
slight
buzzing
noise
when
there
is
no
music
playing,
and
you
can
still
hear
little
amount
of
background
noise
overall
great
battery
life
&
very
easy
to
pair
with
my
iphone
they
do
also
fall
out
of
my
ears
when
run
but
get
that
with
every
type
of
headphone
super
easy
to
pair
and
to
use
was
gift
for
my
husband
like
how
it
adjustable
for
ear
comfort
with
various
padding
sizes
great
value
have
nothing
to
say
about
these
headphones
they
are
amazing
the
sound
quality
is
magnificent
it's
very
easy
to
charge,
and
the
battery
life
is
long
it
is
also
easy
to
pair
with
phones
or
tablets
like
the
sound
quality
but
do
not
like
the
fact
that
the
battery
is
in
the
control
rather
than
in
the
earbud
the
weight
tend
to
pull
the
bud
out
of
my
right
ear
excellent
set
of
bluetooth
headphones
for
great
price,
fit
perfectly
into
your
ears
and
love
that
they
are
sweat
proof
the
ear
bud
itself
is
huge
sticks
out
of
my
ears
way
too
far
for
comfort
and
even
with
the
different
sized
pieces,
still
couldn
get
them
to
fit
comfortably
love
it
can
hear
my
music
as
love
around
house
without
disturbing
others
ve
really
enjoy
these
bluetooth
headphones
the
sound
quality
is
much
more
than
expected
for
this
price
point
they
re
also
very
comfortable
with
three
different
sizes
of
both
the
loop
for
the
outside
of
the
ear
and
inner
ear
too

recommend

are
like
dollar
pods

for
hiking
and
just
answering
my
phone
excellent

until
they
broke
they
were
good
headphones
but
not
worth
the
price
for
just
0/0
months
cardboard
eco
packaging
was
nice
wish
the
earphones
themselves
weren
in
plastic
very
comfortable,
sound
good,
great
deal
for
money
bought
these
for
my
husband
he
wanted
bluetooth
pair
that
was
still
attached
he
loves
the
convenience
of
adjusting
volume
and
next
they
fit
comfortably
in
his
ears
great
purchase
they
sound
good
and
fit
very
well
needed
some
wireless
earbuds
that
would
last
at
least
0hr
this
last
the
whole
day
so
definitely
would
recommend
it
bought
these
for
my
son
who
is
teenager
get
caught
having
one
sided
conversations
because
don't
realize
that
he's
wearing
them
noise
cancellation
must
really
work
well
worth
it
for
$0
have
pair
of
jaybirds
tera
pro's
that
paid
for
and
these
boltone
blows
them
away
it
been
just
few
days
since
bought
it
like
the
sound
quality
so
far
it
is
p/p
producti
was
using
anker
soundbuds
slim
before
it
stopped
working
in
less
than
yearif
compare
to
anker,
boltune
sound
quality
is
better
but
anker
is
more
comfortable
bought
this
because
of
all
of
the
star
reviews
and
the
price
am
not
disappointed
it
is
very
comfortable
and
has
great
sound
quality
very
comfortable
headphones
noise
cancellation
is
excellent
and
sound
quality
is
amazing
would
definitely
recommend
great
bang
for
your
buck
they
were
ready
to
use
out
of
the
box
connected
very
quick
and
they
sound
pretty
good
overall
they
are
doing
great
job
for
me
amazing
sound
fits
perfectly
and
doesn't
fall
out
during
my
most
intense
workouts
great
quality
and
great
sound,
at
this
price
point
there
is
nothing
better
for
the
cost
these
they
are
really
great
sounding
and
comfortable
love
the
little
mesh
bag
they
come
in
as
well
exactly
as
advertised
easy
to
use,
easy
to
pair
with
my
watch
or
phone,
and
the
sound
quality
is
much
better
than
expected
no
regrets
purchasing
this
at
all,
as
it
exceeds
my
expectations
all
around
may
buy
another
one
for
my
wife
pairs
well
battery
lasts
ridiculously
long
the
fewer
charges
need
to
make,
the
less
wear
on
the
charge
port
sound
quality
is
as
good
as
can
discern
at
0+
years
comfortable
either
in
ear
or
worn
around
my
neck
this
set
of
headphones
are
sweet
three
sizes
of
earpieces,
piece
of
cake
to
set
up
bluetooth,
stylish,
totally
convenient
with
the
magnet
on
the
sides
highly
recommend
i'm
very
happy
with
these
bluetooth
headphones
since
they
arrived
i've
been
using
them
nonstop
and
they're
performing
perfectly
really
good
headphone
for
running
they
stay
in
your
ear
and
block
out
they
sound
of
you
huffing
and
puffing
also
have
really
long
battery
life
i've
had
my
headphones
for
over
weeks
now
and
have
only
needed
to
charge
the
twice
these
earphones
were
just
as
advertised
they
provide
great
sound
quality
and
charged
up
really
fast
the
only
problem
is
that
now
that
my
husband
is
try
them,
he
wants
his
own
pair
great
product
for
great
price
good
sound
quality,
however
the
microphone
is
terrible,
can't
make
calls
with
it
use
these
to
listen
to
music
everyday
love
that
they
aren
wired
to
my
phone
so
can
wear
them
without
worrying
about
my
getting
pulled
out
of
my
pocket
great
sound
very
happy
with
this
purchase
very
pleased
with
the
productit
is
able
to
pair
to
devices
at
the
same
time
might
experience
some
drops
here
and
there
but
overall
very
solid
performance
for
the
pricevery
comfy
as
well
great
headphones
can
use
them
for
over
week
at
the
gym
without
having
to
charge
them
lost
my
first
pair
and
knew
wanted
to
buy
another
pair
just
like
them
ve
been
happy
with
this
brand
most
liked
the
range,
better
than
most
comfort
is
good,
battery
life
great
as
well
great
value
for
the
money
got
these
because
my
previous
headphones
broke
as
student,
i'm
on
budget
so
wanted
something
that
was
quality
and
affordable
use
these
everyday
studying
in
the
library
these
were
just
what
needed
you
won't
be
disappointed
great
sound
for
the
price
can
walk
or
run
and
they
don't
fall
out
sturdy
but
loose
enough
around
the
neck
i'd
recommend
them
very
nice
product
without
selling
your
first
child
this
is
the
0rd
one
have
bought
first
one
for
my
uncle
and
it
works
really
nice
then,
my
aunts
heard
about
it
and
want
it
as
well
extremely
satisfied
purchased
this
product
and
haven't
had
it
for
not
even
month
and
the
headphones
mic
to
answer
phone
calls
and
speak
when
making
the
calls
doesn't
work
anymore,
so
am
disappointed
with
this
purchase
great
sound
and
easy
to
use
they
seem
to
work
great,
sound
was
nice,
had
bit
of
hard
to
me
at
first
with
them
staying
in,
but
figured
out
the
right
size
and
now
they're
good
great
for
my
jigs
arrived
earlier
then
expected,
still
adjusting
the
to
get
good
fit,
but
overall
like
them
lot
these
work
great
for
the
price
which
was
surprising
they
have
great
battery
life
and
quick
charging
not
very
good
at
noise
cancelation
but
an
overall
great
product
for
the
price
love
this
earphones
affordable
and
good
quality
my
airpods
microphones
for
some
reason
died
out
switched
to
use
this
and
have
no
regrets
ever
since
these
ear
buds
are
roughly
the
same
price
as
my
previous
ones
and
definitely
feel
like
an
upgrade
they
re
great
addition
to
my
workouts
great
quality
for
the
price
got
these
because
my
other
cheap
earbuds
do
not
fit
anymore
am
very
impressed
with
the
quality
for
the
cost
definitely
not
top
quality
sound,
but
honestly
for
under
$0
you
get
some
really
decent
noise
cancellation
these
were
such
great
value
that
bought
pairs,
one
for
each
of
us
so
we
can
be
hands
free
in
the
car
and
at
the
gym
got
these
earphones
to
replace
the
set
lost
very
impressed
with
this
product
they
fit
well
and
stay
on
during
the
exercises
even
while
jogging
good
sound
quality,
connect
easily
to
my
phone
happy
with
my
purchase
love
these
headphones
they
stay
in
place
while
moving
around
and
running
and
have
great
sound
quality
very
long
battery
life,
been
using
them
for
days
straight
and
still
going
this
is
my
second
pair
of
these,
first
ones
lasted
couple
of
years
use
them
almost
everyday
when
running
love
that
these
headphones
stay
in
when
doing
hiit/plyometrictype
workouts,
sound
quality
is
good
for
the
price
the
play
button
was
messed
up
so
had
to
exchange
them
but
overall
pretty
good
quality
for
the
price
these
are
the
best
headphones
ve
ever
owned
they
sound
great
and
the
batteries
stay
charged
for
hours
wow
battery
life
seems
to
be
really
good
so
far
there
is
slight
static
sound
when
there
is
nothing
playing,
but
i'm
not
sure
it
that's
the
headphones
fault
so
far
they
work
really
well
and
sound
good
pretty
good
earphones
for
the
cost
this
bluetooth
headphones
have
very
good
sound
quality
it
are
comfortable,
have
long
battery
life,
are
waterproof
and
includes
carrying
case
are
perfect
for
use
it
for
answers
my
phone
calls
would
recommend
this
these
are
great
and
at
reasonable
price,
bought
pair
these
headphones
stopped
holding
charge
after
two
months
of
use
they
show
as
charging
and
will
work
briefly
but
die
in
minutes
very
disappointed
in
the
product
do
not
buy
really
great
and
simple
to
use
over
time,
the
battery
life
does
decrease
but
that
is
acceptable
at
this
price
point
these
are
my
goto
ear
buds
and
they
also
make
great
gift
the
product
it's
perfect,
the
sound
it's
really
good
and
the
batery
get
me
pluged
all
day,
the
bluetooth
range
it's
very
good,
higly
recomended
had
it
for
over
month
now
and
despite
the
excellent
battery
life
the
left
earbud
sizzles
all
the
time
used
it
about
times
and
need
new
headphones
already
product
arrived
in
timely
manner
and
was
nicely
packaged
bought
this
as
gift
and
they
absolutely
love
the
headphones
great
quality
for
great
price
am
very
satisfied
with
the
sound
quality,
noise
cancellation,
and
the
battery
life
good
deal
for
the
price
the
magnet
helps
keep
them
on
my
head
and
they
fit
well,
unlike
other
headphones
ve
used
would
recommend
them
good
quality
product
the
headphones
were
easy
to
turn
on
and
had
quality
sound
the
connection
extended
great
distance
was
very
pleased
with
the
product
nice
head
phones
really
was
impressed
with
these
my
gf
has
jbl
that
used
to
borrow
and
the
battery
doesn
last
nearly
as
long
and
they
weren
as
loud
either
ve
bought
another
two
pairs
since
thanks
very
comfortable
my
all
time
fave
the
headphones
are
made
well,
easy
to
use
and
have
very
good
sound
quality
just
received
them
today,
paired
them
to
my
iphone
and
i'm
ready
to
go
so
far
am
very
happy
died
within
month,
if
you
don't
use
them
for
working
out
you
may
be
okay
but
they
definitely
don't
stand
up
to
sweat
the
sound
quality
as
well
as
the
noise
cancelling
ability
of
nearly
eliminating
everything
and
everyone
around
me
makes
it
easier
to
work
now
wohoooooo
with
average
use
expect
set
of
these
to
last
at
least
months
don
waste
your
money
weeks
and
they
don
work
anymore
very
disappointed
spend
your
money
elsewhere
my
first
wireless
pair
of
ear
buds
and
they
are
great
like
the
convenience
of
having
the
cord
hanging
around
my
neck
the
buds
stay
in
place
in
my
ears
well,
too
arrived
quickly
in
great
condition,
paired
easily
with
my
iphone,
and
the
earbuds
fit
well
right
out
of
the
box
sounds
quality
is
nice
for
the
price
quite
happy
works
great
clear
sound,
good
outer
appearance
but
for
physical
activity
purposes
like
running
or
any
kind
of
sports
it
drops
down
quickly
from
the
ear,
doesn't
hold
much
longer
in
the
ear
during
physical
activity
very
pleased
with
the
fit
of
these
headphones
they
provide
few
different
ear
bud
sizes
for
the
perfect
fit
the
sound
quality
is
much
better
than
any
head
phones
that
i've
owned
before
love
the
options
of
ear
sizes
this
product
was
above
and
beyond
what
expected
the
sound
quality
it
great
plus
they
give
you
every
size
earbud
to
possibly
fit
your
ear
the
battery
charges
fast
and
last
really
long
time
this
is
steal
for
the
price
bought
these
because
my
old
headphones
died
these
are
great
for
my
workouts
sound
is
great
and
light
in
weight
on
my
ears
the
only
gripe
is
no
mic
for
using
my
phone
overall
best
headphone
purchase
for
my
workouts
great
sound
really
comfortable
stays
in
ear
securely
is
good
product
bat
they
don't
have
to
much
bass
great
product,
wear
these
for
exercising
and
travel
and
love
them
i've
even
been
able
to
use
these
to
take
calls
while
i'm
cycling
with
no
noise
complaints
great
price
and
quality
i've
tested
these
headphones
both
running
and
with
my
weight
room
workout
and
they
stayed
securely
in
my
ears
with
no
trouble
the
sound
quality
is
pretty
good,
especially
for
the
price
leagues
above
my
$0
pair
had
before
these
are
great
for
the
price
and
the
battery
life
is
amazing
ve
had
them
for
more
than
month
and
use
them
when
go
to
the
gym
have
yet
had
to
charge
them
&
they
don
slip
out
of
my
ear
easy
to
use
sound
is
good
got
my
daughter
these
and
she
loves
them
great
quality
and
amazing
battery
life
use
these
headphones
for
working
out
at
the
gym
they
work
fabulously
and
love
the
price
highly
recommend
great
product
well
worth
it
my
young
child
uses
them
for
distance
learning
for
pe
sound
is
great
and
stays
in
the
ear
the
ergonomic
form
of
the
buds
do
not
hurt
very
comfortable
battery
life
is
fantastic
my
only
complaint
is
how
large
the
buds
are
they
don't
fall
out
of
my
ears
but
they're
still
very
bulky
the
mic
stoped
working
definitely
great
product
for
the
price
music
sounds
great
while
walking
outside
and
when
talk
on
the
phone
on
them
people
say
sound
perfectly
clear
battery
would
only
last
hours
or
so
after
months
ve
had
them
for
almost
months
and
today
they
stopped
charging
voice
sounds
muffled
to
whoever
you
are
talking
to
headphones
fit
perfectly
in
my
ear
after
found
the
right
size,
good
bass,
battery
lasts
or
days
on
full
charge
listening
about
hours
day
overall
great
headphones
bluetooth
is
very
good,
good
sound
quality,
inexpensive,
no
noise,
moderate
volume,
clear
sound,
no
intermittent
sound
any
mobile
phone
can
be
connected
great
headphones
very
useful
for
counseling
out
noise
sounds
clear
and
loud
no
issues
hearing
the
person
on
the
other
end
or
people
hearing
me
during
call
batter
life
even
amazed
me
used
this
one
day
and
my
husband
told
me
sounded
like
was
talking
through
tin
can
and
he
heard
everything
in
the
background
this
is
my
second
time
buying
boltune
bluetooth
headphones
and
i'm
really
satisfied
the
sound
quality
and
noise
cancellation
properties
are
definitely
worth
the
price
and
they're
quite
sturdy
in
design
great
product
for
the
price
seller
shipped
fast
nice
packaging
and
all
accessories
really
like
these
earbuds
they
fit
well
in
my
ears
without
causing
pain
after
hours
of
wear
also
like
the
magnetic
feature,
it
helps
them
not
slip
off
when
not
in
use
highly
recommend
the
sound
is
awesome
really
can
here
the
base
in
music
came
in
as
expected
time
fram
the
only
thing
didn't
like
was
how
big
they
are
length
wise
in
the
ear
but
all
in
all
really
nice
earphones
perfect
for
the
gymmy
ears
are
pretty
small
so
air
pods
don
work
for
me
but
they
are
light
and
come
with
different
sizes
so
they
fit
great
in
my
ear
and
they
re
affordable
they
don
break
the
bank
good
quality
so
far
the
design
is
good
these
earbuds
are
great
deal
battery
life
exceeded
my
expectationsi
use
them
for
workouts,
working
outside
or
just
around
the
house
and
they
are
great
for
everythinggreat
value
for
the
money
it's
light
weight,
comfortable
headphone
especially,
like
its
magnetic
design
:
very
nice
design
for
gym
and
daily
use
love
how
these
fit
in
my
ear,
and
create
nice
seal
to
cancel
the
outside
noise
great
for
running
inside
or
outside
and
doing
all
kinds
of
yard
work
sound
is
fantastic,
and
plenty
loud
to
hear
while
using
amazing
quality
for
the
price
tend
to
have
trouble
with
earbuds
not
fitting
my
ears
well,
but
these
fit
me
perfectly
have
not
experienced
sound
this
good
anywhere
near
this
price
point
before
nice
headphones,
and
good
company
to
work
with
if
you
run
into
any
issues
these
earbuds
are
alot
more
bulky
then
thought
they
were,
noise
cancellation
is
limited,
but
battery
life
is
great
so
the
bulkyness
is
understandable
wouldn't
buy
again
don't
think
but
am
mostly
satisfied
everything
worked
really
well
for
about
month
and
half
about
two
weeks
after
the
return
window
closed
then
they
stopped
working
altogether
won
accept
charge
or
even
turn
on
any
more
product
would
not
take
charge
did
not
received
support
from
company
this
is
for
my
grandson
that
is
autism,
this
is
wonderful
for
him
great
protection
for
the
protection
on
one
of
those
day
he
loves
batman
and
soooooooo
exciting
when
he
saw
it
alot
of
other
ppl
got
itwhere
can
find
it
the
sound
quality
was
awful,
it
sounded
like
crappy
mp0
download
returned
this
item
good
quality
bluetooth
earbuds
that
are
perfect
for
running
comfortable,
good
sound
quality,
and
don't
fall
out
have
used
the
headphones
while
working
my
hour
shifts
and

have
any
issue
with
the
battery
life

is
really
good
as
well
easy
to
set
up,
sounds

and

in
the
ears
please
note
that
the
boltune
bluetooth
headsets
do
not
stay
in
the
ears
as
demonstrated
by
the
pictures
must
show
tutorial
on
installing
the
headset
has
great
sound
and
very
light
bought
for
race
saturday
it
will
be
great
these
are
really
good
headphones
my
husband
uses
them
at
the
gym
and
says
they
stay
put
he
likes
the
sound
quality
they
look
pretty
cool
lit
up
it's
great
that
they
come
with
several
sizes
of
ear
buds
so
you
can
get
proper
fit
these
are
good
headphones
with
long
battery
life
but
the
battery
suddenly
failed
to
hold
charge
after
about
months
excellent
phone,
convenient
daily
to
use,
but
the
charger
connection
has
an
issue
after
halfyear,
then
they
replace
new
one
for
me,
and
it
works
fine
the
headphones
are
little
bulky
but
highly
recommend
because
they
have
magnets
on
the
ends
so
when
your
not
wearing
them
they
stay
on
your
neck
like
necklace
battery
life
is
awesome

good
sound,
three
sizes,
just
little
bit
bigger
than
though
it
would
be
but
really
like
it
they
stopped
working
about
week
after
they
arrived
this
is
clearly
not
the
norm,
just
another
data
pointthe
sound
quality
was
fine,
but
had
slight
background
fuzz
when
the
media
was
silent
the
direction
the
product
came
from
were
really
helpful
it
also
comes
with
little
bag
to
keep
the
head

in,
and

solid
hearing

great
headphones
you
can
purchase
them
with
no
worries
compared
to
other
head
phones,
at

they
seemed
too
heavy/bulky
and
that
they
might
fall
out,
however
after
testing
with
several
runs
they
stay
snug
in
the
ear
would
buy
again
got
these

already
tell

them
on
great
sound
and

what
to
expect
for
$0,
but
it
was
worth

day
multiple
ear
pieces

sturdy
product
not
flimsy
good
sound

had
very

love
my
boltune
headphones,
was
skeptical
with
it
being
such
low
price
but
sounds
great
and
easy
to
use
definitely
recommend
so
far
satisfied
with
the
boltune
wireless
headset
ve
paired
it
to
my
iphone
0+
and
lenovo
flex
computer
very
comfortable,
sounds
great
and
has
great
noise
cancellation
the
magnetic
ends
are
great
touch
for
not
losing
the
headphones
when
not
in
use
overall
it
is
great
product,
wish
it
would
come
with
clip
to
attach
to
the
shirt
this
is
my
second
time
to
order
same
one,
one
for

one
for
ipad
love

great
experience
already
wrote

few
months
and
since

frustrating
the
microphone
doesn
work
well
for
phone

unless
you
re
holding
it
upthey
also
completely
stop
working
after
about
days
excellent
value
for
price
great
product
for
the
money
the
battery
life,
magnet
feature
and
sizing
options
make
this
an
awesome
wireless
headphone
option
bought
these
for
my
wife
for
christmas
and
she
loves
them
quality
is
good
and
the
best
part
is
the
design,
i've
seen
others
failing
easily
during
workout
and
also
i've
charge
only
once
week
it
takes
less
time
to
charge
excelent

nice
sound
granted
that
i'm
only
using
them
to
listen
to
my
podcasts
at
work
and
movies
and
whatnot
at
home,
these
are
great
quality
product
for
the
price
the
product
is
not
very
comfortable
to
wear
the
sound
and
sound
cancellation
are
okay
not
good
for
phone
calls
it's
good
product
for
the
price
the
sound
quality
is
good
and
the
battery
life
is
great
also,
they
stay
in
your
ear
even
during
workouts
this
headset
sound
good
packaging
is
excellent
this
is
one
of
the
best
investment
have
made
am
happy
with
my
purchase
would
recommend
the
seller
and
the
product
good
battery
life,
nice
size
and
fit
the
actual
pod
has
his
weight
to
it
so
it
feels
nicer
than
the
plastic
ones

these
headphones

week
ago
and

using
these
they
just
arrived
and
they
look
nice
they
are
little
large
but
fit
&
look
nice,
work
well
for
working
out
and
are
much
louder
than
expected
for
wireless
earbuds
comfortable,
stay
in
ear,
long
battery,
strong
magnet
to
stay
in
place
when
not
in

it

fall
off

the
money

that
they
also
give
you
extra
ear
pieces
too

from
my

and
like
them

nothing
fancy
but
the
accessories
they
come
with
are
good
plus,
for
the
price
these
headphones
are
worth
it
need
to
amend
my
previous
0star
review
as
these

broke
apart
after
week
disappointed
comfortable
and
clear
sound
love
these
head
phones
they
are
so
clear
and
have
awesome
sound
for
my
work
outs
these
are
some
of
the
best
ear
buds
have
had
in
long
time
because
the
length
of
time
of
usage
is
banging
great
value
these
headphones
are
great
have
smaller
ears
and
these
fit
perfectly
and
stay
in
place
during
workouts

my
only
complaint

that
they

bit
more
difficult
to
pair
to
the
bluetooth
the
price
is
fair
for
the
quality
of
the
earbuds
i'm
enjoying
my
purchase
i'd

about
to
days

about
hours
week
and

them
once
weekly
i'm
really
enjoying
these
wireless
headphones
think
its
great
quality
for
the
price
the
magnetic
earbuds
is
great
feature
product
work
for
week
only
excellent
sound
qualityi
actually
got
it
mainly
for
answering
phone
calls
and
it
works
perfectly
for
that
great
for
use
at
the
gym
bought
another
pair
for
myself
the
first
pair
was
for
my
husbandwe
are
super
pleased
with
the
small
case
and
the
magnetic
feature
it
pretty
good
size
and
doesn
slip
out
also
love
the
case
i'm
having
to
learn
how
to
use
them,
but
so
far
think
boltune
bluetooth
headphones
are
the
bomb
these
things
are
very
comfortable
and
the
sound
is
great
bit
bulky
in
my
opinion
but
not
enough
of
an
issue
to
complain
about
good
sound
quality,
easy
to
use,
comfortable
to
wear
the
battery
lasts
all
day
and
the
sound
quality
is
great
overall
good
product
but
length
of
cords
would've
been
deciding
factor
in
purchase
cord
length
is
to
short
for
my
liking
love
this
headphones
battery
lasts
for
long
time,
sound
is
great,
very
comfortable
to
wear
and
very
good
price

this
is
my
second
pair

these

cutting
grass
to
workouts
including
running
and
jumping
rope
these
headphones
are
worth
the
dollar
great
product
for
an
affordable
price
sound
is
decent,
not
sure
about
battery
life
yet
but
