bought
this
because
the
types
with
an
earhook
are
problem
when
wearing
glasses
and
now
mask.
this
doesn't
interfere
with
either,
it's
super
lightweight
and
barely
notice
i'm
wearing
it,
except
that
my
hearing
of
ambient
sounds
on
that
side
is
limited
because
it
fits
so
well.the
sound
is
very
good;
when
first
got
it,
played
some
music
on
my
phone
to
test
it
out,
and
was
amazed
at
the
clarity
of
the
bass.i
could
see
where
those
people
who
misplace
things
would
easily
lose
this
or
its
usb
charger,
as
they
are
quite
little.
keep
things
in
specific
spot,
every
time
after
use,
so
i'm
not
worried
about
losing
them.so
far,
i'm
happy
with
this.
i'll
update
at
later
date
if
there's
any
additional
good,
or
any
bad,
aspects.
am
mainly
using
this
earbud
for
listening
to
podcasts
as
fall
asleep
at
night.
so
far
after
the
first
week
or
two
can
say
the
following
about
the
strengths
and
maybe
minimal
weaknesses
of
this
earbud:>perfect
size
and
fit
for
my
ear--doesn't
fall
out
in
the
middle
of
the
night.>i
often
fall
asleep
with
it
in
my
ear
and
suffer
no
discomfort
even
if
end
up
lying
on
that
side
with
my
earbud
ear
pressed
against
the
pillow.>i
don't
wake
up
with
it
blaring
low
battery
in
my
ear
so
the
battery
life
has
been
very
good
at
least
until
morning
now
granted
that
is
not
on
the
whole
time
but
it's
mixture
of
couple
hours
of
use
and
maybe
four
or
five
hours
of
standby>the
little
silicone
ear
caps
are
the
good
kind
that
fit
over
little
ridge
and
don't
just
slide
on
the
end
of
the
nub
of
the
earbud--those
other
kind
invariably
end
up
staying
in
your
ear
when
you
remove
the
earbud
because
they
slip
off
the
earbuds
so
easily.>connects
automatically
when
remove
from
the
charger
and
disconnects
when
put
it
back
on
the
charger.
this
latter
fact
is
really
important
as
anyone
knows
who
has
had
the
experience
of
missing
phone
calls
because
they're
going
to
the
earbuds
that
didn't
disconnect!>volume
is
plenty
loud.>tiny
unobtrusive
light
when
charging
but
not
when
in
use
in
your
ear.>this
last
one
maybe
obvious
but
some
earbuds
are
not
shaped
like
this
and
only
fit
in
the
left
ear
or
right
ear--
this
one
is
interchangeable
between
left
and
right
ear.i
have
to
be
really
nitpicky
here
to
think
of
negatives
but
here
they
are:>even
the
lowest
volume
on
my
phone
and
podcast
player
is
just
maybe
hair
louder
than
would
prefer
for
nighttime
listening
with
at
least
some
podcasts...but
not
deal
breaker.
ymmv
depending
on
your
phone,
volume
control,
app,
original
source,
etc.>uncertain
fidelity
for
music...it
might
be
just
fine
but
who
listens
to
music
with
one
ear?
i'm
simply
not
using
it
for
that
purpose
at
this
point
in
time
at
least
so
don't
know
how
good
it
is
for
music.>the
button
to
pause
and
play
requires
little
bit
of
hard
clicky
pressure
but
here
again
not
deal-breaker--
it
doesn't
hurt
or
anything
like
pressing
it
into
your
ear
drum.so
there
you
have
it
...oh
almost
forgot
another
positive--it
was
dirt
cheap...
think
paid
eight
bucks.thumbs
up
please
if
this
was
helpful!
absolutely
love
this
single
wireless
earbud!!
it
exactly
what
was
looking
for
and
so
much
more
than
expected
for
the
price.
wanted
to
get
single
earbud
so
could
listen
to
podcasts
and
books
as
walk
my
dog.
only
wanted
single
earbud
bc
wanted
to
still
be
able
to
still
hear
cars
and
things
around
me
on
my
walk.
this
earbud
is
the
best!
it
so
comfortable
and
fits
in
either
ear.
it
also
very
discreet.
you
can
only
see
have
it
in
my
ear
if
you
are
looking
at
that
side
of
my
face.
looking
straight
on,
you
can
even
tell
that
it
in
my
ear.
the
battery
life
is
great
and
love
that
the
charger
is
also
holder
for
the
earbud.
the
sound
quality
is
amazing,
very
clear
and
the
volume
control
is
great.
was
so
surprised
bc
can
even
talk
on
the
phone
with
it
in
my
ear!
the
ppl
on
the
phone
said
they
can
hear
me
just
like
was
holding
my
phone.
this
is
great
bc
can
multitask,
talk
on
the
phone
and
use
both
of
my
hands
to
do
whatever
want.
like
to
use
it
when
clean
too.
the
bluetooth
distance
is
also
very
remarkable.
can
have
my
phone
inside
and
still
carry
in
groceries
from
my
car
without
losing
connection.
can
also
have
my
phone
rooms
away
and
the
bluetooth
earbud
stays
connected
perfectly.
honestly
don
know
how
made
it
this
long
without
this
single
earbud
in
my
life
lol.
it
great
deal
and
an
amazing
earbud.
pretty
good
for
the
price.
wanted
single
earbud
to
listen
to
podcasts
at
work.
you
can
just
push
the
button
to
pause
it
and
having
just
one
earbud
in
makes
it
easier
to
listen
at
work
when
you
might
get
interrupted.
i've
had
several
different
kinds
of
this
product
and
this
is
as
good
as
any
of
them.
can't
say
what
the
sound
quality
is
like
because
don't
use
it
for
music.
sounds
fine
for
podcasts.
i've
only
used
this
few
times
for
phone
calls
and
was
surprised
that
could
be
heard
by
the
other
party
so
good
and
they
come
through
clearly
as
well.
usually
use
this
at
night
to
listen
to
books
before
go
to
sleep,
so
that
don't
disturb
my
husband.
it
stays
in
place
while
i'm
awake.
when
fall
asleep
it
does
end
up
coming
out
and
have
to
hunt
for
it
bit.
overall
good
buy
and
would
buy
it
again.
this
is
very
portable
and
functional
earbud.
usb
charger
is
included.it
came
in
charged
and
ready
to
use.i
was
able
to
use
it
to
connect
to
my
iphone
and
listen
to
music
and
make
phone
calls.very
functional
and
easy
to
use.i
think
it
can
be
good-to-have
when
driving.great
product!
great
item.
it
fits
in
my
ear
well
and
sounds
good
for
basic
earbud.
one
thing
*really*
like
is
that
it
uses
standard
micro
usb
cable
to
charge
instead
of
custom
one
that
is
device
specific.
have
tons
of
these
cables
so
it
makes
it
easy
and
convenient
to
charge
the
item.
also,
it
provides
battery
level
indicator
on
my
android
phone.
the
sound
quality
of
this
ear
bud
is
quite
impressive
along
with
nice
price.
can
only
use
one
ear
bud
at
work
because
have
to
keep
one
ear
open
for
the
phone
or
people
at
the
door.
listening
time
is
very
good
and
get
at
least
hours
of
listening
time
if
not
more.
it
was
very
easy
to
sync
to
my
