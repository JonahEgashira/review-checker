my
year
old
daughter
loves
these,
they
fit
her
comfortably
and
has
said
they
have
great
sound
this
is
wonderful
product
they
are
very
comfortable
with
bendable
rubber
piece
that
wraps
around
the
ear
the
directions
are
easy
to
figure
out
with
the
pamphlet
included
the
sound
quality
is
good
for
the
price
love
the
compact
case
that
shows
the
battery
life
for
each
ear
which
lasts
long
all
in
all
10/10
i've
only
had
these
headphones
for
couple
of
days,
but
so
far
i've
been
impressedtook
them
out
of
the
package,
charged
them
and
they
paired
perfectly
with
my
laptop
and
my
iphone
no
issues
therei
have
problems
with
fitting
earbuds
in
my
ear,
so
bought
these
with
the
plastic
ear
wraps
the
ear
wraps
are
soft
and
flexible
and
not
noticeable
the
earbuds
fit
great
and
have
no
fear
of
them
falling
outthe
sound
is
clear
the
quality
is
comparable
to
decent
set
of
headphones
it's
not
going
to
rock
your
world,
but
for
the
price
it
definitely
does
what
its
supposed
tobattery
has
lived
up
to
expectations
used
one
ear
bud
for
almost
hours
before
getting
the
"low
battery"
warning
swapped
to
the
other
one
with
no
problem
at
allthe
led
indicators
in
the
case
show
the
power
level
of
the
case
0100
which
is
great
the
individual
power
bands
don't
seem
to
be
registering
properly,
but
this
isn't
deal
breaker
for
mei
noticed
that
the
listing
said
"noiseisolating"
not
"noisecanceling"
didn't
expect
these
to
be
noise
canceling,
but
they
do
decent
job
of
covering
background
noise,
again
like
decent
pair
of
headphonestomorrow
i'm
going
running
in
them,
so
can't
speak
to
that
yet,
but
tried
really
hard
to
get
them
to
fall
out
i'll
update
the
review
after
the
runit's
definitely
worth
giving
shot
at
this
price
point
and
as
company
they
seem
interested
in
building
brand,
so
they
actually
care
about
what
you
think
well,
so
far,
so
good
bass
is
waaay
better
than
another
set
of
sport
earbuds
had;
it's
not
thumping,
but
ir's
decent;
good
enough
for
me
also,
microphone
for
phone
calls
seems
to
be
good,
people
i've
called
said
they
hear
me
loud
and
clear,
no
buzzing
or
static
like
the
case,
too,
with
it's
digital
display
bought
these
initially
as
back
up
to
my
jlabs
ear
buds
of
similar
style
these
have
outperformed
the
jlabs
in
battery
life
but
not
quite
in
sound
quality
the
sound
is
quite
good
but
just
not
quite
as
crisp
as
the
jlabs
for
online
gaming,
which
use
them
most
for,
these
earbuds
are
now
my
go
to
as
the
jlabs
rarely
last
more
than
two
to
three
hours
of
constant
use
where
the
occiam
earbuds
last
more
than
hours
yes,
know,
need
to
get
out
more,
blame
covid
also
like
the
digital
display
in
the
charging
case
this
indicates
how
much
charge
is
left
in
the
case
battery
for
recharging
the
actual
charge
of
each
ear
phone
is
indicated
by
an
led
light
bar
with
led
scale
for
each
ear
phoneon
side
note,
have
not
paired
these
with
my
phone
probably
will
when
go
hiking
and
may
update
the
review
when
that
happensin
the
end,
am
very
happy
with
the
performance,
the
battery
life
and
of
course
the
price
will
be
buying
second
pair
of
these
real
soon
to
be
back
ups
to
my
first
pair
great
pair
of
headphones
at
the
right
price
point
have
two
little
kids
and
move
around
lot
at
work
and
do
lot
of
chores
at
home
have
long
days
and
having
dependable
headphones
that
just
work
is
important
i've
had
them
for
couple
weeks
and
so
far
they
connect
to
the
bluetooth
every
time
without
failure
the
sound
quality
is
good
think
for
the
price,
no
complaints
the
most
fabulous
thing
about
these
headphones
is
the
fit
if
inside
the
ear
tiny
buds
don't
work
for
you
this
might
they
are
very
light
and
the
fit
is
very
lite
on
the
ear
it's
lovely
the
displays
inside
the
case
are
fine
they're
bright
they
work
the
other
favorite
thing
that
like
about
these
headphones
is
that
they
have
button
instead
of
touch
pad
and
like
button
that
clicks
it's
more
dependable
know
it's
not
going
to
come
on
inside
of
my
pocket
if
have
to
throw
my
headphones
inside
my
pocket
at
work
definitely
big
button
fan
over
the
touchpad
yeah
nothing
less
than
five
stars
at
this
price
own
many
different
bluetooth
phones
for
different
applications
have
big
headphones
to
listen
to
music
however,
also
search
for
small
earbuds
for
non
music
usagesmy
first
criteria
is
single
ear
want
to
keep
the
other
ear
open
to
the
surrounding,
when
am
on
call/teleconference
or
just
listen
to
music
this
is
very
important
when
need
to
watch
for
kids
at
home
or
roam
on
streets,
subways,
airportsi
also
want
them
to
be
small,
easy
to
carry
in
pockets,
and
can
be
paired
quickly
started
with
plantronics
m50
many
years
ago,
the
main
complaint
is
the
inflexible
plastic
ear
hook
that
may
be
broken
and
uncomfortable
in
long
calls
later
bought
some
other
airpodstyle
earphones,
but
they
are
always
prone
to
fall
off
my
ear
canals
when
bend
or
lean
towards
side
it
is
pain
to
constantly
raise
hand
to
cover
the
earbud
in
my
earmy
third
criteria
is
left
and
right
can
be
paired
to
different
devices
independently
b/c
constantly
deal
with
multiple
devices
and
don't
want
to
carry
too
many
earphones
for
this
reason
skipped
jlab's
jbuds
air
sportthis
occiam
tws
earbuds
fit
all
my
criteria
perfectly
just
need
to
carry
single
box
in
my
backpack,
b/c
can
pair
one
earbud
to
my
laptop
and
the
other
to
my
cellphone
can
take
it
out
of
the
box
and
get
it
connected
in
few
seconds
the
soft
ear
hook
feels
very
comfortable
on
my
ears
in
hourslong
teleconferences
and
stay
securely
on
my
ear
no
matter
how
my
body
movesi
also
commend
the
customer
service
representatives
in
occiam
they
responded
back
to
my
inquiries
very
fast
and
provided
very
satisfactory
service
love
these
headphones
great
price
and
work
the
same
as
most
expensive
ones
only
wear
one
at
time
when
i'm
doing
things
around
the
house
and
the
sound
quality
is
excellent
the
range
seems
to
work
pretty
well
too
leave
my
phone
in
the
kitchen
lot
to
go
level
up
or
level
down
in
my
house
and
can
still
hear
crystal
clearmy
husband
was
trying
to
talk
to
me
the
other
night
while
only
had
one
side
in
and
nothing
was
playing
on
my
phone
at
the
time
he
was
about
feet
away
and
couldn't
make
out
clearly
what
he
was
trying
to
say
so
had
to
take
the
piece
out
obviously
the
noise
cancelation
part
works
greatthey
are
also
really
comfortable
and
don't
hurt
the
inside
of
my
ear
like
the
style
that
are
just
buds
dothe
charge
lasts
long
time
wear
one
side
during
most
of
the
day,
about
hours
and
never
had
to
recharge
it
they
come
with
the
charging
cord
you'd
need,
its
newer
version
the
kind
that
came
with
my
galaxy
s10
pairing
is
easy
as
well
did
have
one
issue
with
one
of
the
ear
buds
sound
going
in
and
out
but
emailed
the
customer
care
team
and
they
quickly
responded
to
resolve
the
situation
haven't
found
anything
dont
like
about
them
yet
besides
you
can't
travel
too
far
from
your
connected
device
but
for
me
the
distance
is
perfect
this
pair
of
occiam
bluetooth
headphones
are
the
best
bluetooth
headphones
i've
ever
had
speaking
from
djs
point
of
view
the
sound
is
amazing
and
it
has
incredible
bass
with
clear
highs
the
phone
quality
is
excellent
with
very
clear
voice
sounds
and
very
clean
microphone
for
so
peaking
the
battery
life
is
very
good
it
lasted
me
all
day
and
was
at
68%
at
the
end
of
my
work
day
would
and
am
going
to
highly
recommend
the
occiam
bluetooth
headphones
to
anyone
who
wants
excellent
quality
pair
of
headphones
at
very
affordable
price
product
arrived
in
nice
packaging
i'll
test
these
out
at
the
gym
tomorrow
love
the
look
and
they
feel
very
comfortable
will
test
the
battery
life
once
they
are
fully
chargedupdate:successful
time
at
the
gym
wearing
these
the
sound
was
really
good
other
buds
seem
too
low
in
volume
never
felt
like
these
were
coming
out
of
my
ear
like
with
other
budsand
most
importantly
the
battery
lasted
through
my
whole
work
out
had
experience
with
another
brand
that
had
to
return
because
they
would
die
after
45
minutes
these
worked
fine
the
whole
time
have
used
several
types
of
bluetooth
before
now
and
not
happy
with
one
thing
or
the
other
about
them
but,
now,
am
happy
with
everything
about
occiam
bluetooth
headphone1
the
bluetooth
fits
firmly
to
ears
with
its
strong
hanger2
the
sound
quality
of
the
bluetooth
is
100%
satisfactory3
the
noise
cancellation
of
the
bluetooth
is

the
battery
life
of
the
bluetooth
is
100%

the
charger
case
is
not
too
big
or
bulky
to
carry
around6
the
charger
case
charges
faster
than
many
other
bluetoothi
am
sure
anyone
that
buys
occiam
bluetooth
headphone
would
not
regret
buying
it
won't
fall
out
of
ear
but
if
wearing
facemask
the
buds
entangle
with
the
mask
easy
to
use,
just
charge
up
earbud
bank
and
it
will
charge
the
buds
for
one
week
use
one
ear
bud
for
each
use
battery
life
is
ok,
one
bud
lasts
from
morning
till
almost
evening
with
spaced
out
use
got
into
the
routine
of
giving
bud
break
and
switch
out
buds
mid
evening
sound
quality
is
also
ok
but
not
great,
if
using
high
volume
the
music
distorts
and
garbles,
but
like
medium
low
level
anyways
so
its
not
an
issue
i've
been
able
to
pair
my
phones
fairly
easily
with
these
buds,
but
sometimes
pairing
can
be
stubborn
so
just
pop
em
back
into
the
charger
bank
and
start
over,
usually
it
corrects
this
way
nosie
cancellation
is
great,
was
able
to
hear
my
music
while
vacuuming
on
the
highest
volume
these
have
gone
beyond
my
expectations
and
love
them
my
husband
has
wireless
headphones
and
always
complains
about
them
not
working
about
months
into
using
them,
so
was
expecting
cheap
pair
that
would
last
me
few
months
and
have
to
replace
nope
these
headphones
have
great
sound
quality
the
battery
life
is
excellent,
use
them
all
the
time
and
rarely
run
out
of
charge/do
not
charge
them
that
often
are
resilient
let
me
tell
you
storyi
used
these
outside
working
in
the
yard
and
left
them
on
my
windshield
to
remind
myself
to
bring
them
indoors
of
course
forgot
to
bring
them
in
also
forgot
left
them
there,
so
the
next
morning
leaving
for
work
my
windshield
was
frosted
so
turned
on
the
wipers
and
left
for
work
when
got
to
work
remembered
forgot
them
on
my
windshield
searched
my
windshield
to
not
find
them
anywhere
devastated
that
thought
might
have
lost
them
driving
on
the
highway,
was
about
to
order
replacements
when
got
home
thought,
well
maybe
the
wipers
threw
them
in
the
driveway
sure
enough
found
them
in
my
driveway,
they
had
been
sitting
in
the
rain
for
4+
hours,
and
ran
them
over
the
darn
things
still
work
the
case
is
cracked
but
the
earpieces
themselves
are
perfect,
and
they
still
charge
buy
these
wireless
headphones
they
are
super
light
and
very
comfortable
and
very
easy
to
set
up
my
only
complaint
is
that
the
case
makes
noise
when
it
is
on
charging
itself
or
the
headphones
but
it
isn't
super
loudupdate*
really
like
these
headphones
the
sound
quality
is
great
but
had
to
lower
my
rating
slightly
got
second
pair
of
these
and
have
now
discovered
that
the
noise
spoke
of
was
actually
defect
in
the
first
pair
so
don't
know
of
how
frequently
that
occurs
the
battery
on
the
case
would
also
drain
very
quickly
even
when
not
in
use
would
go
to
bed
with
charged
headphones
and
case
at
85%
only
to
wake
up
to
the
case
dead
which
then
had
to
be
plugged
in
to
get
the
headphones
to
just
connect
upon
removal
from
the
case
we
will
see
if
that
was
also
part
of
the
defect
or
not
they
do
have
very
quick
and
responsive
customer
service
and
immediately
contacted
me
to
rectify
the
situation
awesome
customer
service
super
fast
response
even
in
the
weekend
and
they
work
to
make
things
right
bought
these
for
just
keeping
handy
for
doing
things
around
the
house,
but
i've
started
carrying
them
with
me,
and
they've
come
in
handy
when
the
stores
are
already
playing
insipid
christmas
music
alreadyi
like
the
overtheear
style
did
not
buy
them
for
running,
but
if
my
running
earbuds
fail,
would
not
hesitate
to
use
these
while
running,
especially
seeing
as
how
can
use
either
of
them
independently
in
fact,
that's
how
i've
been
using
these,
mostly,
with
just
one
in
while
listening
to
podcaststhe
sound
quality
is
fine,
and
no
better
and
no
worse
than
another
pair
have
that
is
not
the
overtheear
style
and
tend
to
fall
out
that
cost
$80some
people
talk
about
good
or
bad
"noise
cancelation"
but
people
say
all
kinds
of
things
no
earbuds
in
this
price
range
are
going
to
offer
noise
cancelation
as
for
sound
isolation,
these
are
just
fine,
with
three
sizes
of
silicone
not
foam
earpieces
and
it
looks
like
it's
pretty
standard
size
hub,
so
you
can
probably
put
earpieces
from
other
earbuds
on
here
if
none
of
the
three
included
make
you
as
happy
as
clambattery
life
has
been
good,
and
the
indicator
is
pretty
slick
feature
dig
it
just
got
these
and
i'm
impressed
spent
quite
some
time
researching
different
wireless
headphones
and
earbuds
before
came
across
these
love
that
these
are
completely
wireless
but
still
go
over
the
ear
for
more
secure
fit
they're
comfortable
for
my
ears
as
well
which
is
absolutely
fantastic
other
earbuds
i've
tried
more
mainstream
brands
such
as
skullcandy
and
other
ones
always
fit
ok
at
first
but
within
an
hour
or
sometime
less
my
ears
are
in
painthe
noise
reduction
is
spot
on
for
both
ends
like
to
play
my
music
loud
enough
to
block
out
most
sounds
but
usually
that
means
others
around
me
can
hear
the
beat
of
my
music
or
something
of
the
sort
with
these
not
only
do
not
need
to
have
the
music
very
loud
to
cancel
out
noises
going
on
around
me,
no
one
else
hears
my
music
fantastic
dont
know
about
any
one
else
but
that
is
something
that
would
drive
me
insane
way
too
oftenbattery
life
is
solid
and
like
that
you
can
see
how
much
battery
life
is
left
for
each
earbud
sometimes
like
to
only
have
one
earbud
in
so
can
have
conversation
with
someone
at
the
same
time
while
doing
task
ok
was
using
different
brand
and
i've
had
them
for
months
and
now
the
right
ear
won't
seat
in
the
charging
case
without
me
having
to
jimmyrigit
with
toothpick
contacted
that
seller
and
they
didn't
ever
get
back
with
me
would
have
just
ordered
another
set
but
didn't
want
to
spend
$65
on
an
item
that
only
lasted
for
monthsi
ordered
another
brand
that
had
great
ratings
got
them
used
them
hated
them
why
lemme
tell
you
why
love
these:first,
longevity
of
these
bluetooth
headphones
is
pretty
awesome
sometimes
work
10
hour
or
12
hour
shift
and
need
them
to
last
me
that
long
to
get
thru
it
take
lunch
at
hours,
put
them
back
in
their
charger
box
and
i'm
good
to
go
for
the
last
or
hours
also,
the
other
brand
was
using
before
they
stopped
charging,
had
control
buttons
on
each
ear
piece
you
have
volume
up
and
down
button
on
the
top
of
the
ear
piece
itself
and
then
on
the
side
or
outward
facing
part
of
the
ear
piece
is
button
for
pause
and
play
it
may
have
another
function
but
am
unsure
the
second
set
bought
did
not
have
these
features
you
had
to
hold
the
outward
button
down
for
seconds
to
increase
volume,
quick
button
push
to
pause/play
and
what
if
the
volume
was
too
high
didn't
know
how
to
fix
thatsecond,
comfort
is
also
key
element
everybody
has
different
ears
the
first
day
wore
these
my
left
ear
didn't
like
them
too
much
but
wasn't
ready
to
give
up
yet
it
took
me
couple
of
more
days
to
figure
out
just
how
to
set
them
in
my
ear
so
they
were
comfortablethird,
sound
quality
is
pretty
great
don't
listen
to
lot
of
music
yeah
know
i'm
weird
but
do
an
awful
lot
of
podcasts
and
audiobooks
and
if
the
"readers"
sound
tinny
don't
wanna
listen
you
know
great
balance
need
to
be
able
to
hear
the
low
notes
or
tones
and
the
higher
notes
sometimes
these
are
really
rounded
in
sound
like
thatfourth,
cost
$40
was
about
my
price
range
knew
didn't
want
to
spend
any
less
because
the
quality
also
goes
down
with
lower
prices
but
also
liked
that
didn't
have
to
donate
an
arm
and
maybe
leg
for
thesefifth,
have
yet
to
use
them
as
bluetooth
connected
to
my
phone
for
phone
calls
but
i'm
sure
i'm
going
to
like
it
lot
talk
to
my
parents
everyday
on
the
way
to
work
and
hands
free
is
essential
and
everybody
should
be
hands
free
but
don't
make
the
lawsmy
only
complaint
and
it's
really
quite
minor
is
when
take
them
out
of
the
case
and
put
them
in
my
ear
it
takes
probably
full
to
seconds
for
them
to
say
"connected"
one
other
thing:
the
earbud
tips,
they
give
you
different
sizes
but
prefer
the
memory
foam
ones
and
have
to
remove
them
to
get
the
earbuds
back
into
the
charging
case
this
is
the
only
thing
would
change
if
could
just
little
more
space
in
the
case
for
different
earbud
tipsso
a+++
so
far
am
very
happy
with
the
product
my
coworkers
say
the
mic
picks
me
up
clearly
and
the
audio
is
good
too
my
husband
said
the
wires
earbuds
from
apple
are
better
but
if
hadn
done
comparison
mid
call
he
wouldn
have
noticed
the
differencei
like
the
smallest
size
ear
pads,
they
are
very
comfortable
for
my
ear
most
are
usually
too
big
and
hurt
after
biti
like
that
can
use
both
or
one
earbuds
as
need
or
want
like
the
storage
case
and
the
charge
indicator
they
pair
very
easily
and
and
are
comfortable
to
weari
decided
needed
bluetooth
earbud
set
after
my
cat
caused
phone
catastrophe,
getting
caught
on
the
wire
from
my
wired
earbuds,
yanking
the
phone
off
the
table,
and
shattering
my
phone
even
with
case
on
the
size
of
the
ear
phones
are
great
can
never
get
ear
buds
to
stay
in
so
especially
love
the
added
security
of
over
the
ear
feature
just
received
them
so
haven't
really
got
any
miles
on
them
but
they
look
like
the
quality
is
good
will
have
to
leave
an
update
after
using
them
for
period
of
time
the
earbuds
have
wireless
charging
which
is
huge
added
feature
i'm
pretty
confident
wont
lose
these
bad
boys
the
only
negative
see
so
far
is
you
have
to
leave
review
in
order
to
claim
the
free
earbuds
offered
as
prize
kinda
hard
without
getting
to
use
these
first
they
do
look
promising
though
will
update
if
they
wind
up
sucking
well,
finally
got
tired
of
wired
earbuds
especially
as
started
piling
on
the
winter
layers,
tried
few
pairs
of
wireless,
one
of
them
was
poor
sound
quality
and
static
so
wasn't
too
bummed
when
it
easily
fell
out
of
my
ear
for
the
30th
or
so
time
and
got
lost,
the
second
sounded
ok
but
also
easily
fell
out
got
these
backup
to
try
different
brand
because
knew
the
2nd
pair
would
soon
follow
the
fate
of
the
first
love
the
occiam,
the
sound
quality
is
exceptional
for
music
and
passed
my
elderly
moms
hearing
issues,
they
are
very
comfortable
so
much
so
that
fell
asleep
in
one
once,
thought
i'd
lost
another
and
then
found
it
in
my
pillows
they
really
hug
your
ear
and
am
confident
that
will
not
lose
this
pair,
but
if
do
will
replace
with
another
of
this
brand
highly
recommend
and
great
value
i've
been
looking
for
headset
that
replaces
my
bulky
and
heavy
plantronics
voyager
it's
been
quite
search
but
think
have
the
closest
one
yetwhat
really
like
about
this
pair
is
how
clear
the
sound
is
both
in
the
sound
that
hear
and
from
the
volume
of
what
the
person
speaking
with
is
hearing
it
does
the
job
and
like
itone
thing
that
wish
the
headset
will
have
is
slightly
more
bass
and
definition
but
other
than
that
it
provides
adequate
sound
and
signal
am
completely
satisfied
so
coworker
of
mine
chomps
her
gun
so
loud
that
could
hear
it
in
my
old
head
phones
and
needed
to
have
the
sound
up
so
high
it
would
give
me
headache
but
hate
when
people
eat
like
they
were
born
in
barn
and
no
matter
how
many
times
asked
her
to
stop
she
would
for
bit
then
it
would
sound
like
cow
eating
anyway
so
got
these
headphones
to
see
if
it
would
help
and
these
work
so
good
can
have
it
at
normal
sound
level
and
can't
hear
my
coworker
plus
it
gives
me
the
flexibility
to
move
around
with
out
having
to
carry
my
phone
they
are
loud
enough
can
ignore
people
or
just
zone
out
they
don't
fall
off
which
was
big
thing
don't
like
headphones
because
they
either
fall
out
or
the
big
ones
hurt
my
ears
they
work
with
my
very
picky
bluetooth
music
playeralso,
these
bad
boys
survived
an
accidental
excursion
through
my
washing
machine
and
dryeri
love
theseedit
1/10/21:
did
notice
that
lot
of
people
were
commenting
on
the
charging
device
holding
charge
will
say
this
is
does
die
after
whilemine
in
particular,
noticed
it
does
hold
charge
up
to
about
12
days
before
hitting
zero
if
not
using
it
if
use
after
charging
obviously
that'll
deplete
it
if
don't
charge
it
again
love
my
airpods,
but
they
aren't
quite
secure
enough
to
stay
in
my
ears
while
on
my
runs,
requiring
me
to
keep
reseating
them
back
in
my
ears
every
minutes
or
so
so
was
looking
for
pair
that
would
be
more
secure
while
working
out,
but
not
break
the
bank,
and
providing
some
of
the
conveniences
of
my
airpods
these
seem
to
be
an
excellent
value
and
meet
my
needs
the
ear
hooks
keep
them
seated
correctly
while
run
68miles,
the
battery
is
perfect
for
my
use,
and
love
the
charging
case
has
battery
and
charging
indicators
sound
quality
is
good,
not
great,
but
given
the
cost,
it
should
meet
your
expectations
very
happy
with
these
headphones
these
are
the
first
pair
of
earbuds
after
trying
on
quite
few
that
actually
stay
on
my
ear
the
whole
time
while
running
most
ear
hooks
have
found,
are
either
way
too
ridged
or
like
"wet
noodle"
as
others
have
said
these
are
perfect
inbetween
to
me
they
even
stay
on
while
take
my
mask
on
and
off
have
had
some
trouble
with
the
volume
working
consistently
but
the
sound
quality
is
great,
the
range
is
great,
and
they
are
very
comfortable
have
had
to
contact
the
company
and
they
were
quick
to
respond
and
very
helpful
bought
these
to
use
with
my
metal
detector
they
link
up
quickly
and
easily
have
used
them
for
hours
and
they
barely
use
battery
they
fit
my
ears
comfortably
and
after
of
hours
of
use
they
remain
so
have
the
volume
turned
down
very
low
as
they
will
blow
your
head
off
at
up
around
max
would
imagine
the
little
charging
case
is
great
as
well
and
if
you
dont
put
it
in
pants
pocket
it
should
be
sturdy
enough
to
last
long
time,
just
be
aware
of
the
case
and
be
gently
with
it
it
could
stand
to
be
sturdy
enough
to
carry
it
in
jeans
etc,
but
alas
it
is
not
that
notwithstanding
would
highly
recommend
this
product
to
anyone
needed
such
devices
if
you're
looking
for
decent
wireless
ear
buds
on
budget
these
are
great
option
the
sound
quality
doesn't
match
say,
bose
or
sennheiser,
but
neither
does
the
price
they
sound
good
though
and
are
easy
to
wear
you
won't
forget
that
you're
wearing
them
but
you
won't
be
uncomfortable
either
the
tips
are
soft
and
the
ear
loop
is
low
profile
so
you
can
wear
them
for
extended
periods
without
wanting
to
rip
them
outmy
husband
has
comparable
pair
of
vislla
ear
buds
at
the
same
price
and
nearly
identical
design,
also
with
good
sound
compared
to
these,
visllas
are
heavier
on
the
bass
and
these
occiams
have
more
emphasis
on
midrange
/
vocals
which
likethe
case
charging
display
is
helpful
and
the
size
fits
nicely
in
pocket
it's
little
odd
that
when
you
open
the
case
the
right
ear
bud
is
on
the
left
and
vice
versa,
but
no
big
deal
battery
life
is
great
like
the
separate
volume
buttons
on
the
top
of
each
ear
bud
and
that
either
one
can
be
the
master
pairing
is
simple
and
after
the
initial
scan,
the
process
is
automaticit
happens
when
you
remove
them
from
the
case
update
11/21/2020since
my
last
post
of
star
occiam
contacted
me
again
and
explained
the
situation
and
rectified
my
faith
and
trust
in
them
it
takes
real,
true
person
to
be
honest,
admit
their
mistake,
apologize
and
make
up
for
it
really
do
love
the
buds,
they
even
offered
me
money
instead
of
the
free
pair
of
earbuds
as
my
prize
but,
really
wanted
pair
for
my
husband,
so
am
waiting
for
them,
and
have
no
doubt
that
if
have
any
further
problems,
sammi
will
be
there
to
help
me
out
if
they
had
more
stars
i'd
give
them
more
update
11/20/2020what
said
below
is
true,
but
the
company
did
spoof
job
on
my
it
emailed
few
times
asking
for
stars
and,
with
the
buds
came
this
card
about
gift
of
percentage
off
my
card
was
for
gift,
all
the
cards
are
probably
gift
they
were
going
to
send
me
another
pair
of
buds
for
free,
and
give
me
year
warranty
for
free
we
were
conversating
back
and
forth
really
well,
still
had
not
done
the
review
yet
my
last
email
to
them
asked
if
the
warranty
was
for
both
the
buds
this
was
right
after
the
review
all
of
sudden
the
same
email
we
went
back
and
forth
on
came
back
to
me
no
more
contact
poof,
they
disappeareddo
not
give
your
review
until
you
get
everything
that's
bad
business
man,
just
really
bad
business******************************************love
the
fit,
sound
is
dynamic
battery
life
is
ok
usually
have
problems
with
the
buds
going
in
my
ear
these
buds
have
extra
small
covers
and
that's
just
what
needed
the
sound
is
out
of
this
world
think
it
lowers
the
sound
also
so
that
you
won't
have
music
blasting
in
your
ear
battery
life
is
ok
guess,
haven't
really
paid
attention
to
its
length
of
time
it
lasts
for
as
long
as
need
it,
and
the
case
recharge
is
great
too
have
gone
through
good
half
dozen
wireless
earbuds
while
the
sound
is
off
one
will
fall
out
of
my
ear
and
get
lost
that
will
not
be
the
case
with
these
the
sound
is
crisp
and
clear
with
good
base
of
course
have
only
had
these
for
one
day
especially
love
the
lighted
number
tell
me
how
much
charge
in
the
box
and
the
lighted
scale
telling
me
how
much
charge
is
in
the
earbuds
the
hooks
for
the
ears
will
be
master
stroke
for
very
active
people
like
me
this
is
an
addendum
week
later
these
are
so
conformable
forgot
to
remove
them
when
went
to
bed
woke
the
next
morning
and
had
shower
later
found
my
earbud
in
the
shower
stayed
in
my
ear
all
night
and
only
fell
out
while
was
taking
shower
after
drying
it
off
with
towel
set
it
aside,
not
in
the
charger
for
few
hours
and
then
charged
it
and
it
worked
just
fine
am
going
to
buy
another
set
so
when
finally
find
way
to
break
or
lose
these
will
have
back
up
pairing
was
easy,
sound
is
amazing,
fit
is
superior
to
any
other
headphones
i've
owned
i've
owned
earbud
style
headphones
including
$200
bose
that
are
too
heavy
&
fall
out,
over
theear
headphones
that
can
get
sweaty,
aroundyourneck
styles
that
fall
out
or
get
in
the
way,
and
wired
earhook
styles
like
these
which
think
fit
best
these
offer
the
best
of
everything
fit,
weight,
sound,
and
let
me
say
this
about
noise
cancelation:
even
at
moderate
volume,
can't
hear
word
anyone
is
saying,
even
right
next
to
me
to
say
that
i'm
impressed
is
an
understatement
use
these
for
work
daily
10+
calls
per
day
and
love
them
easy
to
pair,
battery
life
is
decent,
but
between
calls
will
just
pop
them
in
the
case
since
it
charges
the
headphones
several
times
on
single
chargei
have
used
them
on
couple
runs
and
they
were
comfortable
with
great
sound
for
music
didn't
have
to
adjust
them
even
with
bouncing
highly
recommended
have
been
buying
alot
of
earbuds
have
big
family
and
every
one
wants
something
different
but
these
do
it
all
great
sound
and
low
price
most
of
the
buds
have
bought
have
less
then
great
stable
connection
most
the
time
they
work
well
but
drop
out
occasionally
these
haven't
dropped
out
once
another
thing
is
most
are
ok
but
when
making
call
they
have
issues
these
seem
great
sound
clear
and
can
hear
with
no
issues
even
wear
them
while
vacuuming
and
still
hear
well
they
stay
on
my
ear
even
during
walks
oh
and
unlike
most
they
have
an
up
and
down
volume
so
no
accidentally
turning
it
up
trying
to
turn
down
all
in
all
they
are
well
rounded
and
don't
seem
to
have
downsides
would
recommend
these
to
anyone
needing
ear
buds
the
only
thing
would
change
is
to
have
bigger
battery
and
port
to
use
to
charge
my
phone
like
some
other
brands
but
would
get
again
either
way
bought
these
earbuds
to
replace
my
broken
ones
and
very
happy
with
these
they
fit
well
and
comfortable
battery
life
is
great
overall,
it's
solid
set
for
the
price
couple
possible
improvements:
wish
they
come
with
additional
sizes
of
the
silicone
hooks
to
fit
younger
people
with
smaller
ears
also,
clear
lid
on
top
would
help
seeing
the
charging
led
without
opening
the
box
pick
berries
in
the
summer
and
like
to
listen
to
music
when
i'm
in
the
woods
the
wires
on
wired
ear
buds
kept
catching
on
things
and
wireless
ear
buds
that
just
stick
in
your
ears
kept
falling
out
i've
now
used
these
twice
and
both
times
they
stayed
on
perfectly,
the
sound
is
great
and
are
very
comfortable
only
down
to
85%
on
the
batteries
after
using
them
for
over
hours
have
tried
at
least
dozen
different
types
of
wireless
earbuds
over
the
past
few
years
in
desperate
attempt
to
find
some
that
don't
hurt
my
ears
after
30
minutes
can
truly
say
that
these
are
the
first
ones
that
don't
bother
me
at
all
put
the
smallest
earbuds
on
them
and
because
they
go
over
my
ear,
the
weight
isn't
constantly
pressing
on
my
inner
earthe
sound
is
great
crisp
and
clearthey
auto
pair
no
problem
i've
had
other
headphones
that
are
nightmare
to
pair,
so
this
was
very
nicethe
battery
life
is
amazing,
and
you
can
recharge
them
several
times
from
the
case
plus,
there's
digital
charge
meter
so
you
can
see
when
you
need
to
recharge
the
caseall
in
all,
am
super
happy
with
these
earbuds,
and
would
highly
recommend
them
especially
considering
how
comfortable
they
are
and
the
great
price
these
work
great
they
are
very
comfortable,
the
sound
quality
is
good,
and
the
charging
case
is
nice
have
many
other
bt
headphones
but
they
are
attached
by
wire
to
each
other
these
are
great
without
that
wire
especially
when
working
out
gives
you
complete
freedom
and
no
more
wire
sticking
to
your
neck
would
highly
recommend
buying
these
needed
earbuds
that
would
stay
in
my
ears
during
fast
spins
and
twizzles
and
also
allow
me
to
leave
my
phone
at
the
wall
of
the
rink
this
set
does
that
need
to
say
that
am
not
able
to
tell
you
if
the
sound
quality
is
that
of
pair
of
beats,
per
se,
since
have
no
real
experience
here
but
for
my
needs,
the
distance
is
about
185
feet
from
the
wall
to
the
end
of
the
arena
and
the
broadcast
not
only
reaches,
it
never
skips
out
if
face
the
other
direction
which
happened
with
older
bluetooth
hookups,
so
annoying
they
are
comfortable
and
the
volume
controls
work
well
the
sound
quality
is
great
for
my
uses
the
battery
life
of
the
case
is
great
and
allows
me
to
only
need
to
recharge
once
week
i'm
happy
bought
these,
they
are
performing
as
needed
and
hoped
these
wireless
headphones
stay
in
great
with
their
soft
ear
hooks
and
have
an
impressive
sound
quality/volume
for
the
cost
the
battery
indicator
in
the
case
goes
the
extra
mile
by
giving
you
reading
on
the
case
itself
and
each
individual
ear
piece
the
package
came
with
little
scratch
card,
and
won
second
pair
these
headphones
sit
very
well
in
my
ears
without
being
too
tight
the
sound
quality
is
amazing,
and
can
listen
to
my
podcasts
without
having
the
volume
on
my
phone
all
the
way
upthe
mic
works
really
well
too
all
my
phone
calls
are
crystal
clear
and
can
answer
and
hang
up
with
the
press
of
button
it
works
so
much
better
than
other
earbuds
i've
tried
that
have
you
tap
it
like
fish
in
an
aquarium
really
recommend
these
headphones,
especially
when
wearing
mask
can
have
other
earbuds
fall
out
have
tried
numerous
other
kind/types
of
ear
buds
and
had
returned
all
of
them
because
of
the
way
they
fit/sound/or
other
negative
issuesyours
is
the
only
one
would
rate
at
delivering
what
you
suggested
on
the
amazon
description
and
morewhat
mean
is
no
other
ones
give
me
the
length
of
play
back
time
yours
does
the
volume
control,
sound,
fit,
especially
when
you
are
active
neat
display
of
battery
levels
ease
of
connecting
to
recharge
by
type
"c"
usb
and
most
important
at
affordable
pricemy
opinion
those
high
level
earbuds
that
cost
timeslike
apple
more
than
yours
don't
even
come
close
to
what
your
occiam
offersas
you
can
tell
am
very
unpaid
happy/satisfied
customer
love
these
head
phones
hike
or
do
some
sort
of
pt
everyday,
and
use
these
while
do
so
they
stay
in
my
ear
while
am
running
or
taking
sweatshirt
off
they
stay
in
my
ear,
which
is
why
got
them
can
stand
it
when
they
fall
out,
or
when
have
to
continually
have
to
readjust
them
don
have
to
do
that
with
these
additionally,
they
do
not
hurt
my
ear
after
wearing
them
for
many
hours
oh,
which
reminds
me
the
battery
life
is
great
go
out
hiking
for
maybe
1/2
hours
they
always
last
the
entire
hike,
just
as
long
as
charge
them
after
each
use
do
have
to
recharge
them
every
night,
they
do
not
hold
charge
otherwise
all
in
all,
these
have
been
my
favorite
earbuds
loved
these
so
much,
that
after
day,
of
receiving
them
bought
pair
for
my
friend
these
are
the
perfect
set
for
work
from
home
and
conference
calls
that
you
get
on
since
am
database
administrator
for
health
care
organization,
these
are
perfect,
since
need
to
type
lot
in
my
work
you
can
also
listen
to
music,
without
disturbing
others
one
of
the
most
amazing
features
it
that
you
can
use
one
or
the
other
and
they
both
have
the
ability
to
control
your
phone
one
other
feature
that
is
also
amazing
is,
you
can
use
one,
while
the
other
is
charging,
and
switch
between
the
two,
which
doubles
your
talk
time
it
also
means
that
you
will
always
have
fully
charged
and
ready
one
to
use
lewie
this
is
my
first
pair
of
having
earbuds
i've
always
be
skeptical
about
earbuds
because
it
doesn't
appear
that
they'll
stay
in
your
ear
so,
the
wrap
around
ear
piece
is
plus
for
me
also,
love
the
fact
that
these
earbuds
can
be
used
either
together
or
independent
of
each
other
very
easy
to
sync
to
my
phone
and
the
quality
of
sound
is
not
bad
the
charger
case
gives
you
the
exact
battery
strength
as
well
i'm
totally
satisfied
at
this
point
stopped
charging
after
first
use
both
worked
one
time
then
the
left
stopped
working
then
both
stopped
charging
and
we
have
not
been
able
to
get
them
to
work
since
my
fiance
was
excited
to
get
over
the
ear
buds
for
christmas
but
i'm
going
to
have
to
return
themcompany
keeps
reaching
out
to
me
telling
me
they
will
pay
me
to
delete
this
review
very
dishonest
company
just
got
it
easy
to
pair,
only
tested
for
music,
which
is
my
main
purpose
nice
balanced
warm
sound,
bass
could
be
heard
at
40hz
at
median
level
high
frequency
is
heard
up
to
about15k
hz,
stopped
suddenly
at
above
frequency
tested
another
earbud,
same
scenario,
sudden
sound
dieoff
above
15k
hz
perhaps
my
hearing
capability
two
drives
are
balanced
well
listened
few
8d
music,
very
locational
the
hook
is
soft
so
there
is
no
stress
around
the
ears,
hrs
on
didn't
feel
thing
didn't
test
for
call
and
waterproof
btw,
this
earbud
is
the
pick
after
two
returns
of
other
brands
not
the
hook
type
overall,
do
recommend
it
the
product
was
bought
to
replace
another
brand
that
was
not
very
good
at
all
this
product
worked
exactly
how
the
manufacture
said
it
would
the
ear
pieces
paired
together
right
out
of
the
case
immediately
without
problem
after
the
two
ear
pieces
paired
then
they
both
paired
with
my
computer
without
problem
it
was
simple
easy
and
quick
the
product
has
held
charge
over
at
least
hours
of
continued
use,
the
case
has
held
90%+
charge
over
the
past
days,
even
after
charging
the
ear
pieces
twice
during
that
period
so
far
like
these
this
review
is
after
using
them
for
days
have
always
struggled
with
airpods
and
earbuds
staying
in
which
meant
couldn't
really
use
them
unless
was
stationary
otherwise
might
lose
themi
received
these
at
christmas
and
have
been
using
them
the
past
weeks
and
really
like
them
these
have
loop
that
goes
over
your
ear
so
falling
out
is
no
longer
problem
that
is
huge
thing
for
methey
are
very
comfortable,
hold
their
charge
very
well,
and
have
great
volume
rangethey
do
have
builtin
microphone
so
can
be
used
for
phone
calls,
but
have
been
told
by
those
on
the
other
end
of
the
line
that
the
clarity
is
not
the
best,
so
use
these
only
for
listening
purposesfor
the
price,
these
are
an
excellent
value
and
would
recommend
them
when
first
got
these
today,
also
was
very
disappointed
with
the
sound
quality
and
the
volume
control
would
not
work
then
learned
that
you
need
to
go
into
your
bluetooth
settings
on
your
phone,
then
go
to
the
advanced
settings
see
picture
you
will
then
need
to
turn
on
the
media
volume
sync
see
picture
after
doing
this
the
headset
will
then
match
your
phone's
volume
and
the
volume
control
will
also
work
hopefully
this
will
help
the
ones
that
are
having
issues
with
the
volume
have
galaxy
phone
so
i'm
not
sure
if
the
same
solution
will
work
for
an
apple
phone
now
that
the
sound
is
fixed,
actually
have
to
turn
it
down
because
it's
too
loud
this
is
great
buy
just
to
think,
almost
returned
them
i'm
so
happy
that
didn't
blessing
always,
gene
pairing
took
about
minutes
to
complete,
and
then
got
to
listen
to
the
sound
for
the
price,
you
just
can't
beat
these
headphones
was
really
impressed
made
couple
calls
to
friends
and
call
quality
was
good
on
both
ends
as
well
the
case
could
use
little
work;
it's
not
very
user
friendly
for
arthritic
hands
haven't
had
them
llong
enough
to
run
down
the
battery
yet,
so
that's
good
thing
seems
like
battery
life
is
pretty
darn
good
because
i've
been
using
them
lot
during
workouts
and
around
the
house
cleaning
may
even
order
second
pair
to
use
just
for
my
tablet
while
watching
movies
in
bed
at
night
so
won't
be
disturbance
love
them
just
got
this
product
yesterday
the
shipping
was
great
timing
charged
them
but
they
keep
saying
78%
charged
even
though
left
them
hours
will
leave
them
over
night
to
charge
se
of
that
changes
but
did
try
them
connected
easy
to
portable
mp3
player
and
sounds
great
said
would
buy
again
but
no
wouldn
sound
is
great
and
connect
easy
to
device
but
don
charge
completely
charged
overnight
and
only
said
68%
they
are
comfortable
and
stay
secure
excellent
lightweight
and
comfortable
on
the
ears
the
hook
is
flexible
and
soft
which
makes
it
plus
am
able
to
literally
shake
my
head
and
the
earbud
stays
in
and
on
my
ears
the
sound
is
good
and
you
don't
have
to
turn
it
up
very
high
to
hear
it
the
display
is
bright
and
easy
to
read,
really
helpful
for
someone
like
me
that
uses
corrective
lenses
the
price
is
great
too,
paid
double
what
this
cost
for
another
brand
earbud
that
had
the
same
quality
would
definately
buy
againbecause
bought
for
husband
and
can't
keep
them
:
sound
quality
is
very
good
and
nearly
as
good
as
the
airpod
pros
tried
out
the
battery
life
is
between
810
hours
people
can
hear
clearly
when
talking
on
the
phone
for
the
most
part,
the
audio
stays
synced
when
watching
videos
if
it
gets
out
of
sync
pausing
and
hitting
play
fixes
it
these
also
are
very
light
and
sit
snugly
and
comfortably
for
multiple
hours
dayareas
of
improvement
being
able
to
view
the
charge
status
through
the
top
would
be
great
and
the
ability
to
be
paired
to
two
devices
at
the
same
time
got
these
for
my
girlfriend
for
christmas
she
says
they
work
really
well
and
she
is
enjoying
them
enjoyed
the
price
and
the
fact
that
she
could
have
ear
buds
to
see
if
they
worked
for
her
had
no
issues
pairing
them
up
via
bluetooth
the
only
thing
keeping
me
from
star
review
is
the
battery
life
is
far
less
than
advertised
also
the
charging
cord
did
not
work
but
had
another
one
to
use
so
charging
up
for
initial
use
was
accomplished
also
the
cord
was
very
short
for
the
method
we
use
to
charge
guess
if
you
had
charging
station
you'd
be
fine
anyway,
customer
support
was
very
good
about
staying
in
touch
and
quite
responsive
also
it
was
nice
that
they
came
with
three
sizes
of
ear
cushions
so
she
was
able
to
find
set
that
fit
in
her
ears
decent
earbuds
and
comfortable
to
wear
around
ears
downside
to
them
is
that
while
sitting
and
charging,
they
make
small
buzzing
sound
that
and
the
earbuds
don't
sit
well
in
the
case,
constantly
then
hooking
up
to
your
phone
even
though
they
should
be
off
had
to
fill
my
case
with
foam
and
cloth
to
push
them
down
onto
the
charger
and
prevent
it
from
connecting
seriously,
for
the
price
how
can
you
go
wrong
had
some
of
the
well
known
fruit
themed
ones
and
they
died
within
weeks
if
these
last
months
could
buy
new
pair
every
six
months
for
years
they
turn
on
automatically
like
the
other
well
known
brands
they
re
really
good
deal
can
stress
that
enough
the
ear
buds
are
fantastic
but
my
case
pin
broke
first
day
so
now
have
to
rubber
band
it
to
keep
case
together
great
quality
and
like
that
it
automatically
connects
when
you
remove
from
case,
makes
switching
from
phone
call
to
ear
buds
quick
and
not
noticeable
to
caller
that
is
probably
my
favorite
feature,
but
also
really
like
that
the
percentage
of
battery
life
is
easy
to
see
they
are
very
comfortable
to
wear
and
don't
fall
out
easy
and
am
in
and
out
of
vehicle
75
+
times
day
for
the
price,
these
headphones
are
really
quite
good
really
appreciate
that
each
one
has
different
volume
control,
and
they
can
be
worn
together
or
soloi
purchased
these
headphones
to
wear
listening
to
music
and
podcasts
while
doing
chores
or
working
out
the
charging
case
is
good
size
not
so
small
you'll
lose
it
but
still
fits
in
pocketi
did
have
one
little
flub
where
it
almost
seemed
like
they
were
cutting
out
from
each
other
while
was
wearing
them
charged
them,
and
it
solved
the
issue,
so
who
knows
they're
fine
now
the
battery
life
seems
little
shorter
than
expected,
but
they
still
last
long
time
do
love
that
you
can
charge
the
casethey
are
also
very
comfortable,
and
don't
feel
like
they're
going
to
fall
out
of
my
ears
even
when
runningall
in
all,
they're
worth
every
cent,
and
i'm
very
pleased
have
sent
two
other
models
from
other
companies/sellers
back
the
others
just
weren
loud
and
just
by
turning
my
head
,
would
sometimes
fall
off
my
ear
one
model
would
charge
one
ear
piece
up
to
about
70%
and
the
other
to
about
48%
this
occiam
is
plenty
loud
enough
and
stays
on
my
ear
pairing
was
automatic
only
had
to
select
the
model
on
my
phone
,
and
it
paired
in
seconds
can
speak
to
the
noise
cancellation
they
advertise
as
feature
just
haven
used
it
long
enough
but,
for
my
short
use
15
weeks
this
brand
gets
stars
have
tried
lot
of
headphones
in
my
day
and
was
skeptical
about
buying
another
set
however,
the
sound
quality
from
these
is
far
superior
to
others
have
owned
they
are
comfortable,
actually
forgot
was
wearing
them
the
other
day
they
charged
quickly,
also
like
the
case
and
the
way
you
can
see
how
much
charge
is
left
they
were
super
easy
to
pair
to
each
other
and
then
to
my
phone
they
feel
light
on
my
ears,
even
when
exercising
and
jogging
they
stayed
put
without
pinching
my
ears
have
not
had
them
long
so
cannot
say
for
sure
that
the
battery
life
is
great
if
it
fails
will
update
my
review
so
far,
would
highly
recommend
these
for
daily
use,
during
work,
exercise,
or
just
all
day
wear
this
is
the
third
set
of
wireless
headphones
have
purchased
the
sound
is
good,
noise
cancellation
is
good,
but
not
too
good
like
to
be
aware
of
my
surroundings,
so
usually
wind
up
taking
one
out
when
walking
aloneyou
can
pause
and
restart,
and
answer
the
phone
with
touch
on
the
side
one
brand
tried
were
so
sensitive
that
my
hair
brushing
against
them
would
turn
them
off
these
are
perfecti
also
have
smaller
ears
and
other
brands
don't
fit
right
and
pop
out
these
are
better
fit,
but
the
overear
part
sold
me
for
surethird
time's
charm
bought
of
these
one
for
me
and
one
for
my
husband
30
days
ago
they
worked
great
good
battery
life
and
great
sound
very
few
disconnects
and
could
hear
clearly
35+
feet
away
from
my
device
then
one
of
my
buds
stopped
getting
sound
after
trying
the
trouble
shooting
steps
contacted
the
seller
and
requested
replacement
and
with
in
day
they
had
me
new
set
haven't
even
made
it
down
to
return
the
prior
set
yet
though
they
give
you
quite
while
to
do
so
but
great
quick
service
and
am
very
happy
with
this
purchase
pleasantly
surprised
by
the
fit,
feel,
sound,
style
and
battery
lifefit
and
feel:
not
too
tight
or
loose
the
hook
adds
more
retention,
taking
less
pressure
off
the
inner
ear
it's
snug
enough
to
be
very
noise
cancelling
or
can
loosen
the
earbud
and
have
the
hook
on
so
that
can
hear
someone
talk
while
still
listening
to
my
audiosound:
the
balance
of
bass
and
treble
is
better
than
expected
sound
may
depend
on
your
phone,
app,
or
choice
of
music
for
me
the
bass
is
deep
and
clearbattery:
days
of
15
to
hours
listening
each
day
and
the
battery
is
at
40%
remaining
much
better
than
other
buds
have
i've
had
other
pairs
like
the
handy
case
/
battery
pack
that
shows
the
level
of
charge
for
the
ear
buds
and
the
case
itself
when
you
put
the
earbuds
in
the
case,
they
start
to
charge
when
you
take
them
out,
they
automatically
turn
on
and
pair
with
your
device
the
controls
on
the
earbuds
to
turn
them
on,
off
and
volume
control
are
pretty
easy
to
work
with
my
wife
purchased
one
pair
and
we
liked
them
so
much
that
purchased
second
pair
for
myself
unfortunately,
the
second
pair
had
problem
and
over
24
hours
would
discharge
the
battery
on
the
charging
case
contacted
occiam
by
email
and
they
are
correcting
the
problem
first
time
use:
case
fully
charged,
paired
with
them
and
my
phone
showed
80%
charge
started
listening
and
within
minutes
they
said
"power
low"
two
minutes
later
they
shut
down
from
loss
of
power
fantastic
fit
and
build
quality
too
bad
they
couldn't
get
the
actual
function
to
match
the
form
factorupdate:
recharged
them
and
watched
the
power
level
on
my
phone
as
they
went
from
100%
to
10%
within
the
span
of
one
song
battery
discharge
that
fast
doesn't
seem
safe
in
your
ears,
imo
good
sound
quality
and
fits
securely
like
the
power
display
on
the
case
not
for
noise
cancellation
but
you
can
hear
the
audio
good
over
external
sounds
have
only
had
set
for
days
but
overall
satisfied
with
purchase
this
company
offers
you
free
gift
if
give
them
star
rating
the
only
thing
is
they
never
deliver
on
the
gift
after
you
give
them
the
rating
they
will
tell
you
to
buy
the
product
again
and
give
them
another
star
rating
what
scam
company
first,
really
like
the
fit
and
feel
of
these
they're
not
cumbersome
and
the
hook
around
the
ear
makes
them
feel
secure
the
sound
is
very
nice
and
the
charging
case
is
well
made
and
holds
them
nicely
also,
the
case
holds
charge
for
very
long
time
obviously,
that
would
depend
on
how
often
you
have
to
charge
your
headphones
fully
from
very
low
state
however,
the
battery
life
appears
to
be
quite
long
and
adequate
for
just
about
anyone's
needs
appreciate
that
you
can
use
either
one
or
both
if
you
don't
want
to
break
the
bank
and
still
get
some
quality
headphones,
these
are
nice
choice
great
form
factor,
charging
case
fits
in
my
pocket,
comfortable,
never
fall
off,
can
be
used
one
at
time
or
paired,
easy
to
pair,
charge
in
the
case
multiple
times
sound
quality
is
good,
although
not
audiophile
quality,
but
great
for
the
price,
good
microphones
in
either
or
both
earpieces,
get
about
hours
of
podcasts
on
charge
when
battery
gets
low,
audio
announcement
just
pop
one
in
the
charging
case
fr
few
minutes,
then
swap
earphones
and
charge
the
other,
so
no
interruptions
the
occiam
bluetooth
headphones
came
well
packaged
the
charging
station
works
well
and
like
that
can
use
one
earbud
independently
of
the
other
they
paired
with
my
phone
on
the
first
try,
and
the
sound
is
clear
haven't
used
them
long
enough
to
gauge
true
battery
life
yet,
but
i'm
not
sure
necessarily
need
to
if
put
the
earbuds
right
back
in
the
charging
station
when
i'm
done
using
them
the
earbuds
came
with
three
different
size
rubber
earpieces
so
they
are
comfortable
to
wear
and
don't
really
pull
on
your
ear
as
some
earbuds
do
i'll
write
another
review
in
about
six
months
once
have
put
these
earbuds
through
their
paces,
but
first
impressions
say
these
are
quality
earbuds
couldn't
be
happier
to
step
into
the
modern
era
of
wireless
headphones
am
battery
life
challenged
in
all
things
cellular
and
love
that
can
charge
the
ear
phones
and
the
case
simultaneously
and
if
the
ear
phones
go
dead
can
pop
them
back
into
the
case
to
charge
without
needing
to
plug
in
somewhere
plan
on
using
them
on
future
flights
i'll
update
later
if
anything
changes,
but
for
now
couldn't
be
happier
with
the
sound
quality
and
the
fact
that
they
stay
in
my
ears
over
the
years,
i've
spent
small
fortune
on
headphones
from
the
most
expensive
to
disposable
i've
never
owned
earbuds
because
am
notorious
for
losing
things
this
has
been
the
best
purchase
i've
made
this
year
love
the
hooks
that
keep
the
buds
and
love
the
different
cushionsthe
sound
quality
is
good
sound
is
not
of
particular
interest
what
is
most
important
is
the
ability
to
connect
to
my
phone
easily
these
earbuds
connect
seamlessly
it
comes
with
an
electronic
charger
case
for
storage
and
easy
charging
love
it
product
pairs
easily
with
an
iphone
and
sounds
good,
but
in
use
it
randomly
loses
contact
with
one
or
both
ears
it
reconnects
but
after
gaps
in
playback
very
annoying
wanted
headphones/buds
that
were
easy/quick
to
put
in
and
take
out,
had
good
sound,
had
sensible
controls
for
mute/volume
etc,
and
would
stay
firmly
in
place
for
running/exercise
after
considering,
trying
and
returning
number
of
other
products,
these
satisfied
all
my
requirements
the
range
of
sound,
including
base,
is
clear
and
pleasing;
not
earpods
sound
quality
but
not
too
much
of
step
down
for
the
huge
price
difference
the
case
is
well
made
and
the
charging
indicator
is
plus
the
controls
on
both
left
and
right
ear
are
intuitive
and
easy
to
access
overall,
am
impressed
by
the
intelligent
design
and
quality
of
this
product
this
is
my
first
review,
so
will
try
to
keep
it
short
just
got
these
headphones
so
can't
say
anything
about
battery,
but
pretty
much
everyone
gave
it
stars
so
i'm
expecting
good
results
originally
chose
these
because
of
the
high
ratings
from
everyone,
and
they
were
not
wrong
the
audio
is
amazing
and
its
so
easy
to
connect
i've
been
using
this
on
both
my
laptop
and
phone
and
it's
been
an
amazing
experienceupdate:
so
thought
had
an
issue
with
the
charge
because
they
wouldn't
charge
no
matter
how
much
used
my
nintendo
switch
charger
to
charge
them
lol
turns
out
it
didn't
work
like
that
so
plugged
the
case
in
with
the
charger
it
came
with
and
it's
been
charging
these
are
10/10
earbuds
and
recommend
them
to
anyone
ok,
so
bought
these
because
apple
air
pods
just
don
stay
inthat
being
said,
these
do
plus
don
have
to
push
them
all
the
way
into
my
ear
to
here,
so
no
ear
fatigue
eitheryou
can
use
one
at
time,
which
doubles
the
battery
lifeplus
with
battery
charge
display
inside
the
box
ow
when
to
recharge,
which
for
my
use
is
about
once
weekso
far
so
good
only
one
month
in
will
update
later
hope
this
helps
my
son
needed
new
ear
buds
and
wanted
these
after
reading
the
reviews
and
researching
different
ones
they
definitely
cancel
noise
cause
he
can
hear
us
calling
him
when
he
has
them
in
when
he
in
his
moods
you
can
hear
the
music
across
the
room
word
for
word
battery
life
could
be
better
but
they
last
him
48
hrs
then
he
has
to
charge
them
now
that
he
back
in
school
and
can
use
them
all
day
when
used
all
day
he
has
to
charge
them
that
night
he
very
happy
with
them
was
little
skeptical
of
the
warranty
registration
process
originally,
since
it
was
supposed
to
come
with
free
gift,
and
figured
it
might
come
with
something
like
this,
an
ask
to
leave
5star
review
with
that
said,
purchased
these
for
my
wife
and
we
have
both
used
them
over
the
last
couple
of
weeks
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
the
sound
quality
and
the
general
ease
of
use
my
wife
has
tiny
ears,
so
even
the
smallest
ear
pillows
don't
fit
her
perfectly,
despite
this,
still
see
her
regularly
use
them
it
seems
her
favorite
mode
is
just
using
single
one
to
listen
to
the
news
in
the
mornings
while
sitting
outside
with
her
coffee
personally
love
the
stereo
mode
have
had
number
of
overear
studio
headphones,
gaming
headsets,
and
midhigh
tier
ear
buds,
both
bluetooth
and
wired
over
the
years,
and
so
far
these
are
proving
to
be
an
incredible
value
the
sound
cancelling
also
works
great
would
not
be
giving
this
product
this
review
if
felt
the
quality/price
quotient
was
not
there
do
still
love
my
significantly
more
expensive
overear
studio
headphones
while
i'm
at
the
house
yes
would
like
pair
of
these
if
ever
need
to
go
back
to
the
office
or
listen
to
music
in
public
also,
yes
these
are
worth
there
price
like
these
better
than
my
past
overpriced
samsung
earbuds
the
sound
is
great
they
sounds
honestly
better
than
any
others
have
tried
like
that
these
don't
have
dominant
earbud
so
if
want
to
use
either
bud
@
anytime
it
works
have
small
ears
&
this
style
is
great
don't
even
no
there
on
after
short
time
the
case
is
nice
as
well
shows
individual
charge
of
each
earbud
the
case
is
durable
&
not
overly
big
overall,
these
are
nice
and
have
sizes
of
ear
inserts
included
they're
awkward
to
put
on,
but
securesound

and
the

is

bought
one
pair
different
brand
for
my

and
we
had
to
return
them
because
one
ear
kept
dropping

replaced
them

so
far
they
have
been

they
sound
great,
last
long

after
charging
and
keep
up
with
her
active
lifestyle
we
are
very
happy
with
the
purchase
and
would
recommend
them
to
anyone
else
to
try
so
many

also
very
good,
you
are
hardly

sound
is
great
for
something
in
this

range,
nice
low

without
distorting,
mids
are
clear

distinct,
highs
are
sharp
and
clearwhile
putting
them
away
for
the
night
just
bit
ago
the
lid
fell
off

casewe
found
the
lid
but
there
was
only
one
hinge
pin
where
it
clearly
looks
like
there
should
have
been

was
able
to
get
it
back
together,
and
tried
opening
it
and
it
easily
fell
off
againover
all
the
case
is
the
weakest
part
of
these
earbuds
the
buds
them
selves
have
good
sturdy
feel,
the
case
give
clear
information
on
the
status
of
both
the
case
power
supply,
and
the
earbuds
power
supply,
but
the
outer
feel
and
construction
appears
to
have
been
overlooked
by
quality
controlwill
send
the
company
an
email
and
see
if
they
address
the
issue,
if
they
stand
by
the
product,
will
increase
my
rating,
if
not,
then
buyer
beware
don't
get
me
wrong
this
is
awesome
product
want
to
give
it
higher
review
if
it
wasn't
for
the
fact
that
every
time
put
the
the
bluetooth
in
the
case
the
bluetooth
bounce
up
and
down
causing
the
case
to
charge
them
when
already
at
100
percent
the
case
dies
really
fast
but
other
than
that
it
works
well
for
the
price
these
headphones
are
incredible
given
the
price
point
and
how
well
they
perform
they
hold
charge
extremely
well,
sound
quality
is
great
as
well
as
the
comfort
minor
glitches
sometimes
when
out
running
but
it
once
or
twice
max
and
it
reconnects
itself
without
any
intervention
from
me
second
break
in
sound
and
then
smooth
sailing
small
price
to
pay
for
using
them
68
times
before
needing
to
recharge
the
base
and
having
zero
issues
otherwise
i've
been
using
this
product
for
about
two
weeks
now,
and
below
what
found:sound
for
music:bass
is
good
i've
tried
few
music
styles,
from
jazz,
classic,
rnb
to
metalsound
for
phone:the
person
on
the
other
side
can
hear
me
quite
clearly
however,
notice
more
complaints
when
using
whatsapp
for
an
international
call
but
so
far,
the
domestic
call,
regular,
and
voip
are
just
finebattery:i
consistently
get
perhaps
35
charges
from
the
charger,
for
total
of
2428
hours
of
use
the
earbuds
themselves
can
be
played
for
close
to
hours
couple
of
times
used
them
for
calls
all
day,
and
they
worked
perhaps
56
hoursoverall:for
the
price
less
than
$25,
found
these
earbuds
satisfy
my
need
and
would
probably
get
another
seti
will
continue
reviewing
and
testing
them
for
their
other
features
and
will
update
my
review
accordingly
really
wanted
to
write
good
review
for
these
but
in
all
honesty,
can
not
i've
been
wearing
these
for
few
weeks
now
and
every
time
begin
to
sweat,
it
seems,
the
right
one
cuts
out,
repeats,
"power
on"
several
times
take
it
out,
dry
it
off,
play
with
it
little
bit,
and
then
put
it
back
it
sometimes
that
works,
sometimes
it
doesn't
now
the
left
one
is
starting
to
do
the
same
thing
these
are
supposed
to
be
sweatproof
and
used
during
exercising
can't
tell
you
how
annoying
it
is
to
try
to
get
these
to
work
while
still
trying
to
keep
pace
and
exercise
was
so
excited
to
get
these
and
begin
using
them
because
for
the
most
part,
the
reviews
were
good
now,
i'm
disappointed
these
wireless
headphones
are
great
buy
am
very
pleased
with
the
sound
quality
for
listening
to
music
and
voice
calls
the
microphone
is
excellent
too
and
provides
excellent
voice
clarity
the
sound
is
little
on
the
base
side
but
not
distracting
they
style
of
the
headphones
look
little
dated
but
wanted
something
that
would
stay
in
my
ear
100%
of
the
time
and,
can
control
playback
from
the
earpiece
which
is
super
convenient
when
im
exercising
don't
have
to
pull
my
phone
out
to
skip
songs
or
take
voice
call
the
headphones
fit
great
in
my
ear
and
the
piece
that
goes
around
my
ear
is
super
comfortable
can
easily
forget
that
am
wearing
them
the
customer
service
of
occiam
is
tops
the
first
set
received
would
not
charge
due
to
bad
port
on
the
charging
case
occiam
promptly
sent
me
new
pair
no
issues
at
all
got
these
as
backup
for
when
my
airpods
needed
charging,
but
it
turns
out
prefer
them
they
stay
in
and
they're
better
at
noise
cancelling
like
the
fact
that
the
charging
pod
tells
you
what
percent
battery
it
has
sometimes
there's
little
connectivity
issue,
which
is
why
can't
star
it,
but
i've
had
the
same
types
of
connectivity
issues
with
the
airpods,
too,
and
these
were
much
less
expensive,
so
can't
complain
too
much
about
it
sound
quality
is
just
ok
left
earpiece
doesn
stay
in
place
for
me
when
jogging
and
it
also
powers
off
and
on
frequently
after
jogging
for
while
not
sure
if
it
from
sweat/moisture
touching
the
charging
contacts
but
it
extremely
annoying
for
the
price
they
re
ok
overall
but
they
don
work
well
for
me
so
returning
them
think
lot
of
the
star
reviews
on
here
are
because
the
company
promises
free
gift
if
you
write
one
i've
only
had
these
few
days
now
but
i'm
impressed
with
the
sound
quality
knowing
that
can
recharge
with
the
case
power
supply
earbud
at
time
when
necessary
is
another
great
plus
they
have
been
easy
and
comfortable
to
wear
and
are
the
first
earbuds
i've
purchased
that
needed
to
turn
down
in
volume
instead
of
up
all
or
nearly
all
the
way
now
that
i'm
retired
i'm
looking
forward
to
listening
to
lot
of
music
before
needing
to
recharge
instead
of
worrying
do
have
enough
power
left
to
complete
call
to
tech
support
before
my
earbuds
drop
me
from
completing
call
well,
as
the
title
implies,
these
are
my
first
pair
of
wireless
bluetooth
headphones
have
bluetooth
single
earpiece
for
phone
calls
but,
thanks
to
these,
guess
won't
be
needing
it
anymorethere
are
two
earpieces
with
guards
for
your
ears
so
you
don't
have
to
worry
about
them
falling
out
they
come
in
case
which
doubles
as
charger
the
usb
cable,
that
is
included,
is
really
short
you
may
want
to
get
longer
one
setup
is
breeze
you
pair
the
headphones
with
your
favorite
device
they
turn
on
and
connect
automatically
whenever
you
remove
the
earpieces
from
the
case
and
disconnect
when
you
put
them
back
in
to
chargethey
fit
beautifully
like
hand
in
glove
they
are
comfortable,
too
like
pair
of
your
favorite
shoes
i'll
use
these,
mainly,
for
listening
to
music
and
for
that
they
are
perfect
controls,
right
at
your
fingertips
play/pause,
skip
track
and
volume
with
simple
tap
on
the
buttons
located
on
the
earpieces
itself
best
of
all,
no
wires
great
quality
for
the
price
got
these
as
spare
set
to
replace
bose
sport
plus
set
which
are
great
but
find
that
these
are
way
faster
at
connecting
between
devices
and
can
use
them
while
gaming
playing
some
fortnite
with
no
issues
they
stay
on
and
are
comfortable
can
have
them
on
for
an
hour
or
longer
with
no
ache
in
my
ears
i'm
not
too
worried
about
noise
cancellation
as
like
to
hear
what's
going
on
around
me
while
out
exercising
on
while
using
them
as
headset
paired
to
my
phone
while
driving
all
in
all
great
set
of
buds
for
the
price
highly
recommended
really
happy
with
these
headphones
don
like
the
kind
that
just
sit
in
the
ear
prefer
this
style
that
hooks
over
the
ear
it
more
comfortable
to
me
don
listen
to
music
with
them
much,
so
can
comment
on
the
sound
quality
for
that
mainly
use
them
to
listen
audiobooks,
podcasts,
or
watching
tv
for
that
purpose,
they
work
great
ve
been
using
them
awhile
now
and
they
seem
to
be
holding
up
well
was
so
surprised
by
the
quality
of
sound
in
these
earbuds
wow
the
sound
is
so
clear,
the
bass
is
deep,
perfect
eq
noise
cancellation
is
good
on
music,
haven't
tried
it
on
phone
call
yet
lots
of
little
tricks
to
learn
yet
but
so
far
very
impressed
bought
these
because
needed
pair
of
bluetooth
earbuds
so
could
walk
around
and
listen
to
music
while
doing
tasks
around
the
house
without
dealing
with
wires
or
having
to
bother
my
spouse
while
they
worked
these
are
decent,
especially
for
the
price
after
about
week
of
using
them
haven't
had
to
deal
with
the
signal
dropping
out
or
the
buds
falling
out
of
my
ears
while
moved
around,
like
i've
had
to
deal
with
using
other
affordable
earbuds
in
the
past
really
easy
to
set
up
too
random
note,
but
also
like
the
design
of
the
charging
casenot
*as*
important
though
i'm
glad
to
see
the
charge
levels
of
both
earbuds,
that's
helpful,
but
just
thought
i'd
mention
itall
in
all,
pretty
happy
with
these,
they
get
the
job
done
without
hassle
love
this
item
originally
bought
this
since
had
another
pair
of
headphones
like
these
but
connected
with
string
with
wearing
mask
and
having
more
strings,
wanted
to
try
cordless
pairsome
highlights
that
love:you
can
wear
one
headphoneit
automatically
turns
on
and
off
when
you
take
it
in
and
out
of
the
casecontrols
on
each
headphonemicrophone
works
well;
use
this
to
connect
to
my
laptop
and
make
calls
from
there
too
as
well
as
my
phonei
was
debating
on
getting
airpods,
but
am
so
glad
got
these
instead;
esp
this
type
of
headphone
that
has
hook
to
your
ear
and
controls
on
them
love
how
the
case
displays
both
the
charge
left
on
the
case
and
on
each
headphone
the
sound
is
crisp,
clear,
and
good
base
they
fit
comfortably
and
very
ease
to
pair
with
my
devices
the
noise
cancellation
is
excellent
even
with
the
volume
not
turned
up
very
loud
excellent
product,
great
quality,
and
one
of
the
best
bluetooth
headphones
i've
had
in
long
time
highly
recommend
was
not
paid
for
this
review
these
headphones
work
pretty
well
the
fit
is
perfect
as
can
seem
to
keep
any
apple
product
in
my
ears
sound
quality
is
good
ajd
the
ease
of
charging
is
convenient
and
simple
it
seems
that
sometimes
the
context
of
the
ear
bud
in
the
case
isn
the
greatest
and
doesn
register
to
charge
unless
push
the
ear
bud
in
to
force
contact
otherwise,
the
earbuds
have
worked
well
for
running
long
distances
10
miles
think
i've
found
the
one
great
balanced
sound
with
enough
bass
for
me,
voice
calls
clear
for
both
parties,
fit
snugly
and
comfortable,
good
pairing,
and
love
the
'old
fashioned'
volume
up/down
and
on/off
buttons
no
need
to
remember
how
many
times
to
tap
which
bud
and
for
what
plus
rechargable
case
is
great
let's
you
know
the
charge
left
on
each
bud
great
price
for
what
you
get
now
let's
hope
they
last
think
they
will:
they're
pretty
sturdy,
with
good
sound
quality,
and
not
too
techy
returned
the
item
as
could
not
get
it
to
charge
went
on
their
web
site
and
followed
their
instructions
for
non
charging
device
but
to
no
avail
looked
like
nice
set,
but
if
cant
get
it
started
now,
not
sure
want
to
try
it
again
like
how
you
can
use
both
or
just
one
at
time
just
received
today,
so
far
so
good
sounds
good,
comfortable
to
wear
additional
info:
been
wearing
few
days
after
fully
charging
charge
has
lasted
days,
it
only
at
75%
usage
now
which
is
awesome
the
music
comes
through
with
clear
melodic
sound
and
receiving
phone
calls,
folks
commented
that
they
could
hear
my
responses
loud
and
clear
as
you
can
see
the
part
that
goes
around
your
ear
has
broken
it
just
snapped
in
twoalso
the
noise
canceling
is
nonexistent
everyone
complains
about
the
background
noise
you
can't
walk
outside,
drive,
wash
dishes
or
anything
elsebattery
life
of
the
headphones
is
good
the
charging
case
works
well
and
it
holds
charge
for
long
timenow
to
see
about
replacing
since
they
broke
the
sound
on
this
unit
is
very
low
just
like
other
newer
waterproof
earbuds
have
tried
recently
and
must
have
tried
more
than
10
of
them
the
wireless
headset
got
last
year
that
is
not
waterproof
has
much
better
sound
in
terms
of
volume
and
bass
tried
it
for
few
minutes
and
decided
to
return
so
cannot
say
much
about
the
call
quality
or
battery
life
also
it
disconnected
couple
of
times
:
these
things
are
great
ve
had
ton
of
wireless
headphones
from
cheap
to
pricey
and
these
are
lot
of
bang
for
the
buck
would
definitely
recommend
to
someone
who
uses
wireless
buds
for
working
out
ve
had
cheap
headphones
go
bad
due
to
moister
from
workouts
and
running
in
the
rain
these
hold
up
great
and
the
charging
case
and
the
buds
feel
like
quality
product
in
hand
unlike
other
similar
ones
ve
had
would
definitely
recommend
and
will
buy
them
again
when
lose
this
pair
like
always
do
really
want
to
like
these
earbuds,
but
the
charging
is
so
inconsistent
that
they're
basically
useless
charge
them
every
day
from
when
leave
work
to
when
get
back
to
work
the
next
morning,
and
about
half
the
time
they're
complaining
of
low
battery
within
the
first
ten
minutesoh,
and
if
you
try
to
charge
the
earbuds
and
the
charging
case
doesn't
have
enough
power
to
charge
them
fully,
all
three
items
will
shut
down
entirely
until
you
charge
the
case
again
fun
stuff
was
never
able
to
get
earbuds
to
turn
on
ensured
proper
battery
charge
twice
tried
turning
on
using
both
the
auto
on
feature
when
removed
from
case
and
manual
switch
neither
workedalso,
admittedly
only
one
earbud
worked
left,
but
overall
tonal
quality
was
mediocre
at
best
bass
response
was
sub
par
even
though
on
line
description
advertised
deep
bass
response
have
enjoyed
this
product
they
are
light,
cancel
out
other
noises
well,
and
comfortablethese
will
work
for
talking
on
the
phone
but
the
other
person
complained
about
hearing
an
echothey
don't
shut
off
automatically
when
put
in
charging
case
which
really
effects
the
battery
lifeoverall,
would
recommend
these
and
plan
on
buying
set
for
my
husband
great
sound;
i've
had
other
headphones
that
just
focused
on
heavy
bass
these
have
more
balanced
sound,
which
prefer
because
listen
to
all
kinds
of
music
and
podcasts
these
are
lightweight
and
the
hooks
fit
really
well
around
ear
really
like
these
and
for
the
price
it
is
hard
to
beat
if
i'm
going
for
long
run
or
ride
don't
have
to
worry
about
having
headphones
that
are
not
charged
enough
these
wireless
earbuds
are
awesome
the
sound
is
very
clear
and
the
volume
can
easily
be
adjusted
even
while
you're
wearing
them
when
listening
to
music
they
hold
their
charge
for
around
hours
and
love
the
fact
that
the
case
can
be
charged
separately
without
the
buds
in
them
and
from
that
single
charge
the
case
can
recharge
the
ear
buds
about
to
times
without
being
plugged
in
again
love
the
freedom
these
earbuds
give
bought
these
mainly
for
use
with
my
phone
while
working
at
the
restaurant
bit
of
hassle
trying
to
access
phone
when
your
hands
are
covered
with
some
kind
of
food
70%
of
the
time
and
having
bit
of
music
is
always
great
morale
boost
during
prep
ear
buds
were
almost
fully
charged
when
had
received
them
and
paired
quickly
and
easily
with
both
my
phone
and
switch
with
bluetooth
attachment
they
came
with
usb
to
micro
usbc
charging
cord
as
well
as
additional
ear
pad
coverings
in
different
sizes
that's
always
nice
to
have
around
the
ear
buds
fit
nice
and
snug,
don't
move
around
as
i'm
running
up
and
down
the
restaurant,
and
most
importantly
can
wear
my
glasses
with
them
without
the
ear
piece
being
in
the
way
audio
is
amazing
battery
life
is
amazing,
and
the
charger
case
fits
well
in
my
coat
pocket
overall
super
happy
and
already
have
family
member
dropping
hints
as
to
what
they
want
for
christmas
have
constant
struggles
with
most
earbuds
as
they
don't
stay
in
my
ear,
even
when
i'm
not
exercising
these
are
fantastic,
they're
easy
to
put
on,
and
the
overear
clip
keeps
them
firmly
in
place
like
that
you
can
use
one
at
time,
and
the
case
shows
you
how
charged
each
isi
mostly
use
it
for
podcasts,
so
can't
rate
the
sound
quality
but
am
very
satisfied
easy
enough
to
set
up
like
that
you
can
use
either
one
or
both
together
often
like
to
walk
and
listen
to
podcasts,
and
prefer
to
do
that
with
one
ear
openupdate
after
the
first
weekend:i
used
them
both
with
my
laptop
and
iphone
battery
life
is
good
so
far,
and
after
few
days
of
frequent
use,
i'm
still
on
the
first
charge
of
the
charging
casethey
are
very
secure
as
mentioned
before,
like
to
listen
to
podcasts
and
books
while
walking
but
also
when
exercising
and
doing
household
choreswell
worth
the
product
price
just
got
these
yesterday
and
couldn
be
more
excited
have
tiny
ears
and
can
never
get
earbuds
to
stay
put,
especially
while
am
working
out
tested
these
out
right
away
and
they
are
perfect
they
are
comfortable
and
had
no
issues
with
them
falling
out
during
my
workout
sound
quality
is
good
for
the
price
you
really
can
beat
it
had
some
issues
registering
for
the
warranty
on
their
website
and
eventually
gave
up
figured
if
have
to
buy
another
pair
oh
well
not
big
deal
but
their
customer
service
reached
out
to
me
and
told
me
they
were
notified
was
registering
my
product
but
never
completed
explained
my
trouble
and
they
finished
registering
my
product
for
me
was
very
impressed
with
how
helpful
and
attentive
their
customer
service
is
stars
all
the
way
my
wife
has
been
liking
the
occiam
bluetooth
wireless
earbuds
she
uses
them
while
walking,
running,
talking
on
the
phone,
and
watching
videos
on
her
phone
she
has
used
several
other
brands
over
the
years
she
is
petite,
so
what
she
most
likes
about
these
earbuds
is
the
lighter,
more
narrow
earpiece
than
what
some
of
the
other
overtheear
earbuds
have
the
other
much
appreciated
feature
is
the
charging
case
that
shows
battery
life
levels
for
the
charger
and
each
earbud
overall,
we
are
happy
with
the
quality
and
performance
of
the
earbuds
for
such
an
affordable
price
never
give
stars
to
anything
or
anyone
but
based
on
my
experience
so
far
with
these
ear
buds
they
deserve
every
star
sound
quality
is
better
than
anticipated
and
the
controls
are
simple
enough
but
effective
that
even
techchallenged
guy
like
me
can
make
them
work
the
range
is
good
and
the
one
earbud
only
deal
is
really
great
convenience
if
any
of
this
changes
substantially
anytime
soon,
i'll
relay
that
update
to
you,
too
so
far
am
very
happy
with
this
purchase
i've
been
using
these
for
few
weeks
i've
had
junk
headphones
from
amazon
in
the
past
so
am
am
skeptic
when
it
comes
to
headphones
these
are
comfortable,
good
sound
quality
and
long
battery
there
is
an
indicator
showing
the
charge
level
and
and
an
indicator
that
both
headphones
are
charging
great
for
running
and
working
out
love
these
have
expensive
headphones,
but
forgot
them
at
home
as
was
on
an
extended
trip
knew
would
need
some
while
working
remotely
and
trying
to
be
unobtrusive
to
others
found
these
like
the
fit
and
feel
better
than
my
expensive
brand
ones
like
the
indicators
for
battery
life
and
how
they
fit
into
the
case
and
start
charging
immediately
definitely
recommend
great
product
at
great
value
connects
quickly
and
easily,
sound
quality
fits
the
price,
no
audio
lag
while
watching
videos
on
my
device,
comfortable,
like
the
buttons
on
the
ear
pieces
which
eliminates
accidental
commands
on
touchversion,
nice
packaging
all
in
all,
very
satisfied
love
these
ear
buds
can
stand
the
tiny
earbuds
that
apple
provides
and
they
never
stay
in
my
ears
so
always
have
to
opt
for
wrap
around
wasn
about
to
spend
over
$200
for
earbuds
so
went
with
these
based
off
of
reviews
and
price
so
glad
took
the
chance
just
received
them
yesterday
and
they
easily
canceled
out
outside
noise
even
with
the
phone
volume
at
midway
these
paired
very
easily
and
sound
great
mostly
use
them
for
audio
books,
but
the
clarity
and
bass
are
excellent
for
music,
too
most
importantly,
they
actually
stay
on/in
my
ear
really
well
love
that
you
can
use
them
separately
or
together
and
they
have
actual
buttons
for
on/off
and
volume
my
last
pair
not
occiam
were
so
finicky
was
constantly
adjusting
them
to
get
them
to
stay
in
my
ear
and
accidentally
pausing
my
book
in
the
process
definitely
fan
so
far
can't
go
day
without
them
now
that
i've
worn
them
love
them,
there
so
easy
and
you
can
have
one
ear
in
and
they
other
one
charging
which
most
you
can't
or
my
last
one
you
couldn't,
have
had
them
for
about
months
now
and
use
them
every
day
love
can
listen
to
music
while
am
cleaning
and
no
one
else
has
to
hear
it
can
wear
them
all
day
there
very
comfortable
and
they
come
with
three
different
sizes
included
with
changing
cable
as
well
would
recommend
these
to
my
friends
and
family
bought
these
because
have
had
good
luck
with
inexpensive
bluetooth
devices
in
the
past
these
would
constantly
disconnect
and
randomly
reconnect
they
were
very
inconsistent
ended
up
returning
them
because
like
being
able
to
listen
to
music
continuously
these
arrived
very
quickly
they
paired
easily
that
is
the
end
of
the
good
stuff
the
right
earbud
will
not
hold
charge
no
matter
how
long
the
case
is
charged
for
i've
tried
the
trouble
shooting
and
have
not
had
any
success
so
far
even
after
full
charge
overnight
the
right
earbud
will
only
work
for
about
15
minutes
before
start
getting
annoying
"battery
low"
warnings
in
my
right
ear
had
to
edit
this
to
just
one
star
when
first
got
them
they
fit
great
so
there's
star
for
that
but
everything
else
was
just
awful
the
sound
quality
dropped,
you
would
start
to
only
hear
power
on
all
the
time
the
battery
life
was
bad
also,
literally
had
to
charge
them
up
once
at
least
everyday,
and
they
only
lasted
couple
hours
until
needing
to
be
recharged
but
of
course
they
gave
me
free
pair
for
star
review,
which
thought
was
deserving
after
only
having
them
one
day
had
given
it
few
days
never
would
have
given
them
stars
for
the
money
these
are
an
excellent
choicebattery
life
is
outstanding
with
gauge
to
tell
you
how
long
to
outdon
stay
in
my
ear
wella
little
difficult
to
hear
voices
on
podcasts
and
phone
callsi
buy
again
can
wait
to
enjoy
thesethey
come
highly
recommended
by
friend
and
the
amazon
reviews
are
excellent
as
well
just
happy
to
not
loose
any
buds
that
pop
out
of
my
earexcellent
they
use
usbc
now
toonow
that
ve
had
them
few
days,1
the
most
comfortable
ear
buds
have
ever
worn
ear
wrap
is
very
comfortable2
battery
life
is
excellent3
sleek
design
i'm
impressed
i've
been
looking
for
bluetooth
earbuds
for
while
and
finally
settled
on
these
like
that
they
come
as
set,
one
for
each
ear
love
the
battery
life
like
that
there
are
buttons
for
power,
sound
and
play/pause
these
have
good
range
the
sound
quality
is
great
and
like
that
can
use
them
to
answer
and
talk
on
my
phone
highly
recommend
very
high
tech
cool
looking
headsets
they
work
like
charm
great
value
for
the
money
wont
give
stars
for
sound
quality
because
have
used
very
high
quality
headsets
before
and
this
is
not
in
the
same
league
but
that
being
said
these
would
beat
any
top
of
the
line
headphone
when
comparing
sound
quality
per
dollar
spent
have
been
using
these
over
month
without
issues
wore
them
in
rain
as
well
and
they
still
work
battery
life
of
the
pouch
is
great
however
the
buds
themselves
have
to
be
recharged
after
every
hour
or
the
primary
battery
life
of
the
pouch
is
accurate
but
the
individual
battery
gauge
for
each
ear
bud
always
remain
at
one
level
it
just
tells
you
that
the
headphones
are
docked
and
charging
not
the
actual
charge
level
of
each
ear
bud
excellent
quality
product,
last
7h
42min
using
it
for
zoom
calls
and
listen
to
music
during
work,
after
dull
charge
the
battery
case
made
of
good
quality,
think
it
will
not
last
feet
drop,
didn't
test
that
the
audio
quality
is
above
average
,
but
considering
the
price
tag
it
is
excellent
in
regards
the
pairing
process,
their
is
no
pairing
button
since
it
is
automatically,
you
must
shutdown
any
old
paired
device
when
want
to
swap
from
iphone
to
ipad
to
television
so
bought
this
think
it
is
good
quality
but
didn't
fit
my
ears
for
some
reason
so
returned
it
for
another
option
from
the
manufacturer
just
because
it
didn't
work
for
me
doesn't
mean
it
won't
work
for
you
seems
well
made
and
sound
it
good
set
up
was
very
simple
the
hoop
things
didn't
fit
the
curve
of
my
ears
seemed
to
wide
around
them
so
was
weird
to
wear
really
like
headphones
cannot
wear
the
earbuds
like
apple
makes
because
had
ear
surgery
&a
small
part
of
my
ear
is
not
there
to
hold
them
in,
so
was
looking
fir
earphones
that
attach
to
my
ear
but
yet
are
hidden
use
these
all
the
time
for
phone
calls
when
driving
or
working
so
am
hands
free
the
sound
is
really
great
tried
another
brand
but
they
had
glitch
in
them
ever
so
often
but
these
don
great
qualitysharon
really
like
these
headphones
they
fit
comfortably
and
stay
on
when
run
needed
headphones
that
clamp
over
my
ears
cause
all
the
other
one
would
fall
out
as
ran
or
sometimes
just
walking
either
side
can
be
the
master
and
if
you
only
want
one
turned
on
the
other
will
work
independently
which
love
the
charging
case
is
sleek
and
compact
the
only
reason
gave
it
four
stars
on
the
charging
is
cause
haven't
fully
tested
the
longevity
of
them
yet
over
i've
been
looking
for
wireless
bluetooth
buds
headset
to
replace
pairother
brand
that
lasted
only
1/2
months
i've
had
these
for
weeks
and
am
very
satisfied
with
the
fit,
the
battery
life,
the
ease
of
connecting
and
style
it
is
also
noted
that
when
you
open
the
case,
the
led
display
shows
the
precise
amount
of
charge
currently
in
the
headsets
really
like
about
how
clear
the
sound
is
mostly
use
then
to
listen
to
music,
the
clarity
and
bass
are
great
originally
bought
another
brand
of
wireless
earbuds
through
amazon
but
product
did
not
satisfy
the
sound
quality
was
looking
for
and
sound
would
come
and
go
then
took
the
task
of
finding
another
set
of
wireless
earbuds
in
the
amazon
store
and
ran
into
the
occiam
product
really
liked
the
sleek
modern
design,
had
good
reviews,
sound
quality
is
very
good
at
this
price
and
best
of
all,
it
was
at
the
same
price
point
as
the
set
from
the
other
bad
brand
am
highly
satisfied
with
the
occiam
wireless
earbuds
will
definitely
recommend
them
to
my
family
and
friends
the
sound
quality
and
bass
was
excellent
for
the
price,
and
the
hooks
allowed
for
comfortable
fit
on
my
ear
without
them
falling
off
the
only
drawback
was
that
when
the
charging
port
on
the
inside
of
the
earbud
is
exposed
to
lot
of
sweat
or
water,
the
bluetooth
connection
is
briefly
interrupted
to
fix
this,
you
have
to
take
the
earbuds
out
and
dry
them
off
with
your
shirt
or
towel
and
the
bluetooth
connection
should
be
restored
however,
this
can
still
get
annoying,
especially
for
longer
workouts
fortunately,
when
emailed
customer
support
letting
them
know
about
this,
they
were
super
nice
and
offered
to
send
me
new
pair
of
earbuds
with
the
charging
port
at
the
bottom
where
sweat
is
less
likely
to
interfere
that
being
said,
overall
they
definitely
deserved
the
five
star
rating,
and
would
highly
recommend
this
product
was
in
the
market
looking
for
headphones
that
can
accompany
me
for
livestreams
and
came
across
these
the
headphones
are
very
easy
to
use/setup,
the
sound
quality
is
great,
battery
life
is
amazing,
case
is
awesome
looking
personally
like
headphones
such
as
these
that
have
hooks
for
ear
stability
with
these
you
can
answer
phone
calls
very
easily
as
well
would
recommend
these
highly
received
my
item
very
quickly
however,
when
opened
the
package,
it
looked
like
it
was
refurbished
model
there
were
fingerprints
all
over
it,
and
the
"antiscratch"
stickers
were
not
stuck
in
the
same
spots
connected
the
charging
cable
and
it
wasn't
properly
seated
until
significant
pressure
was
applied
the
audio
is
very
muffled
and
the
microphone
picks
up
all
the
ambient
sounds
so
you're
unable
to
be
understood
returned
them
to
find
better
alternative
they
sound
good,
fit
comfortably
but
took
one
star
off
because
received
large
earbuds
and
only
small
one
which
needed
because
my
ears
are
very
smalltake
note
of
the
volume
control,
which
wasn't
working
well
for
me,
are
individually
controlled
i'm
not
sure
like
that
feature
but
we'll
see
with
the
replacement
buds
and
i'll
update
my
review
great
product
finally
found
ear
buds
that
stay
in
my
ears
&
deliver
great
listening
experience
easy
to
set
up&
keep
charged,
not
that
you
have
to
charge
all
the
time
the
price
is
reasonable
for
what
you
are
getting
shows
%of
charging
on
ear
phones
&
%
left
in
charging
box
greatyou
won
be
disappointed
with
this
purchase
love
them
very
comfortable
to
wear,
feels
secure
on
my
ear,
and
easy
to
use
sound
quality
is
excellent
i'd
say
comparable
to
apple
airpods
pro
useful
display
of
battery
life
for
case
and
earbuds
really
like
having
volume
controls
on
both
earpieces
my
only
complaint
is
that
the
case
feels
cheap
and
is
on
the
larger
side,
which
perhaps
makes
it
easier
to
hold
for
the
price,
you
can't
go
wrong
these
earphones
are
an
amazing
piece
of
affordable
high
spect
technology,
amazing
sound
and
noise
cancellation,
it's
amazing
what
you
get
for
the
price
that
you
pay,
they
are
nearly
perfectkey
word,
nearly,
even
thought
these
earphones
definitely
deserve
starts,
my
pair
came
with
little
problem,
the
music
keeps
on
cutting
off
every
now
and
then
i'd
say
around
twice
for
the
length
of
minute
song,
know
i'll
get
it
fixed
when
activate
my
lifetime
warranty
so
i'm
not
concerned
:
was
nervous
about
them
when
my
husband
told
me
that
he
ordered
them
for
me
have
small
head
and
ears
so
was
afraid
they
wouldn't
fit
when
got
them,
surprisingly
they
fit
great
love
that
they
come
with
different
size
ear
buds
and
charger
it's
even
better
that
the
case
is
the
charger
and
they
charge
while
in
the
case
as
long
as
the
case
is
charged
but
doesn't
have
to
be
on
the
charger
when
take
them
out
of
the
case
they
automatically
turn
on
and
connect
to
my
phone
sound
quality
is
great
the
only
thing
is
it
picks
up
lot
of
my
background
noise
when
am
on
the
phone
people
can
hear
it
as
if
they
are
in
the
area
with
me
haven't
had
them
long
enough
to
play
around
with
it
to
see
if
it's
something
that
can
adjust
they
are
great
and
ease
of
use
ordered
this
second
set
for
my
stepdad
because
he
loved
his
first
pair
of
occiam
headphones
but
wanted
different
style
the
sports
style
fits
snug
and
comfortable
so
he
doesn't
have
to
worry
about
it
falling
out
during
yard
work
love
that
the
case
shows
the
battery
life
of
the
set
so
it's
easy
to
tell
when
they
need
to
be
charged
and
when
they
need
to
be
taken
off
the
charger
very
affordable
for
the
sound
quality
would
recommend
sometimes
have
lot
of
down
time
at
work
so
got
these
to
help
keep
me
entertained
wear
one
at
time
and
i'm
able
to
pause
my
music
whenever
need
to
with
simple
press
of
the
main
button,
no
matter
which
side
has
the
headphone
the
battery
life
lasts
through
the
work
day
with
frequent
pausing
and
resuming,
with
break
in
the
case
for
lunch
also
picked
these
specific
ones
because
wanted
it
to
sit
over
my
ear
instead
of
in
my
ear
canal
they're
extremely
comfortable
and
not
invasive
at
all
i've
been
using
them
about
weeks
and
have
charged
the
case
once
im
getting
great
sound
quality
from
these
earbuds
they
go
louder
than
can
stand
they
dont
lose
connection
while
playing
music,
with
my
phone
in
my
pocket,
which
is
huge
problem
with
every
set
ive
owned
exercised
with
them
as
soon
as
got
them,
thats
what
bought
them
for
they
handled
the
river
of
sweat
from
hiit
training,
no
issues
once
got
them
adjusted
right
they
didnt
movegreat
buy,
will
look
into
their
other
products
purchased
these
earbuds
with
the
expectation
that
would
get
what
paid
for
i've
honestly
been
shocked
by
the
sound
of
these
earbuds
use
them
while
biking
and
even
riding
into
the
wind,
the
sound
is
pure
pairing
was
easy,
the
charging
case
with
its
indicators
is
solid
am
totally
impressed
paid
so
much
more
money
for
my
daughters'
airpods
and
don't
think
the
sound
is
any
better
these
are
an
outstanding
value
the
sound
is
great
and
the
battery
life
has
been
good
like
this
type
of
bud
because
the
others
do
not
stay
in
my
ears
also
like
that
can
use
one
bud
at
time
so
can
listen
to
my
favorite
podcast
and
hear
other
sounds
around
me
while
wearing
really
like
that
the
led
meter
tells
me
how
charged
they
are
too
they
recharge
quickly
as
well
really
love
these
earphones
was
skeptical
being
that
they
are
so
reasonably
priced
but
they're
awesome
the
battery
life
is
way
longer
than
expected
and
the
sound
is
crisp
and
clear
they
also
fit
securely
so
will
be
great
when
go
on
run
once
the
weather
warms
up
i've
thought
about
buying
them
again
just
to
have
second
pair
to
keep
in
our
second
home
rather
than
carrying
these
around
really
worth
while
purchase
wrote
review
yesterday
that
never
made
it
here,
so
i'm
posting
again
think
these
are
worth
the
effort
very
impressed
with
the
charging
case
and
the
stats
it
provides
love
that
you
can
use
these
independently
of
one
another
and
love
the
sound
that
comes
out
of
these
haven't
used
them
on
phone
call,
but
my
music
and
audiobooks
are
joy
to
listen
to
through
these
great
volume
and
bass,
as
well
may
buy
another
pair
don't
normally
leave
bad
reviews
but
this
one
deserves
it
not
only
does
the
case
not
work
correctly
such
as
showing
the
individual
earphones
level
and
maoumt
of
overall
power
for
the
case
additionally
they
send
card
saying
you
get
discount
code
and
warranty
which
did
not
get
response
to
either
from
what
can
see
worst
of
all
they
won't
stay
turned
off
and
will
connect
to
my
device
in
the
case
making
only
resolve
to
to
forget
the
devicevery
annoying
sound
quality
is
poor
and
seems
to
amplify
background
noise
:
these
are
just
what
was
looking
for
my
kid
is
doing
remote
learning
and
we
needs
nice
pair
of
ear
buds
one
she
can
wear
and
one
can
wear
they
fit
her
little
ear
great
and
mine
as
well
the
sound
is
great
and
nice
and
clear
in
both
ends
her
teacher
even
asked
for
the
link
for
these
as
the
sound
was
so
very
cleari
highly
recommend
these
if
your
looking
for
good
pair
read
lot
of
the
reviews
for
these
ear
buds
and
finally
decided
to
try
them
out
am
pleasantly
surprised
with
the
sound
quality
and
features
ease
to
pair
up
and
the
charging
case
tells
you
how
charged
they
are
which
is
very
useful
obviously
not
as
good
as
over
the
ear
noise
canceling
headphones,
but
not
too
bad
if
your
looking
for
less
expensive
option
this
is
good
pick
the
item
works
as
described
the
sound
quality
is
good
the
noise
cancellation
is
good
where
the
product
really
stand
out
is
battery
life
even
when
the
carrying
case
isn
plugged
in,
the
earbuds
charge
in
there
case
when
the
case
battery
life
is
charged
also,
the
ease
at
which
the
item
pairs
and
turns
off
automatically
is
huge
plus
love
them
so
far
the
case
is
so
cute
with
the
lcd
light
and
for
the
price
the
sound
is
good
and
clear
and
they
pair
so
well
with
my
phone
truly
love
them
better
than
the
beats3
returned
yesterday
the
sound
quality
is
much
better
than
the
beats
headphones,
the
fit
is
secure
for
me
and
you
cant
beat
the
quality
compared
to
the
prize
*update:
the
company
has
reached
out
to
me
twice
to
rectify
the
situation
which
appreciate
so
they
get
an
extra
star
however,
something
is
wrong
in
their
qc
process
if
headphones
like
the
ones
received
are
considered
to
pass
charged
these
and
was
able
to
use
them
once
before
they
refused
to
ever
turn
on
again
while
charging
the
left
headphone
the
case
made
an
annoying
high
pitch
ringing
waste
of
money
unfortunately
that
have
been
returned
as
didn
want
paper
weight
have
found
my
new
favorite
ear
headphones
the
battery
life
lasts
forever
purchased
these
because
my
bose
sounded
good
but
died
in
couple
hours
and
the
sound
quality
when
talking
to
people
suckedthese
occiam
headphones
are
amazing
and
at
great
price
sound
quality,
battery
life
and
microphone
quality
thank
you
really
like
this
airbuds
think
the
sound
quality
and
functionality
is
great
can
pause,
rewind,
activate
assistant
and
control
the
volume
of
the
bluetooth
it
perfect
for
my
workout
sessions
they
don
fall
out,
they
are
very
comfortable
and
the
battery
last
long
time
the
battery
display
is
nice
and
useful
have
them
connected
to
my
tv
when
am
working
out
only
issue
with
my
set
is
that
the
charging
case
does
not
work/
charge
therefore
my
earbuds
worked
for
two
weeks
but
now
can
charge
them
they
are
very
comfortable
and
sound
great
but
can
charge
them
charging
case
didn
work
from
day
one
the
couple
of
times
they
hooked
up
with
my
phone
was
excited
the
quality
was
great,
but
they
kept
disconnecting
and
then
negatively
affected
my
phone
had
to
return
them
purchased
these
to
replace
my
over
the
ear
headphones
big
mistake,they
can't
no
comparison
in
sound
quality
at
all
these
are
good
for
phone
conversations
only
the
battery
life
is
good
other
than
that
nothing
else
positive
of
this
purchase
for
me
had
little
trouble
with
pairing
these
to
my
phone,
but
once
finally
got
them
to
do
that
they
are
great
wanted
pair
of
truly
wireless
headphones
for
work
and
these
are
just
the
thing
they
sound
great
and
like
the
oneear
feature
because
can
only
use
one
earbud
when
i'm
at
work
overall
good
pair
of
headphones
for
the
price
found
the
headset
to
be
comfortable
and
the
sound
quality
good
do
get
hrs
of
play
time
in
my
left
earbud,
but
the
right
one
only
lasts
7hrs
have
charged
and
drained
the
battery
dozen
times,
but
only
get
hrs
max
from
the
right
earbud
it
is
kind
of
annoying
,
but
aside
from
the
batter
it
is
good
headset
these
headphones
are
really
bad
the
fit
is
bad
if
your
ears
are
exactly
the
same
size
as
the
part
that
wraps
around;
there's
no
flexibility
they
will
not
work
well
unless
they
have,
at
least,
90%
charge,
otherwise
they
lose
the
signal
every
few
seconds
and
your
music
sounds
awful
further,
the
storage
case
only
serves
to
drain
the
charge
all
the
more
please
note
that
these
buds
do
not
hold
charge
of
any
kind
as
soon
as
they
are
done
charging,
they
begin
to
lose
their
charge
not
good
was
using
apple
airpods
yet
they
wouldn't
fit
very
well
in
my
ears,
felt
like
they
might
fall
off
so
wanted
something
with
ear
hooks
this
one
had
good
review
from
lot
of
people,
decided
to
try
so
far,
am
pretty
satisfied:
sound
quality
is
excellent,
battery
seems
to
last
long,
and
pairs
with
my
iphone
real
easy
hard
to
beat
the
price
have
tried
many
of
these
bluetooth
earbuds
at
the
same
price
range,
this
is
the
only
one
kept,
returned
all
the
rest
so
far,
loved
it,
did
not
notice
any
flaws
yet,
the
battery
life
is
perfect,
it
will
last
me
an
entire
day
without
recharging,
and
people
never
complains
about
my
voice
level
for
phone
calls
no
issues
with
ordering
no
issues
with
shipping
my
order
came
in
on
time
registering
for
warranty
was
simple
charging
has
been
simple
manual
for
my
earbuds
has
been
easy
to
read
and
easy
to
follow
everything
was
in
the
box
that
was
supposed
to
be
in
the
box
just
received
my
earbuds
today
so
i'll
update
if
they
are
less
than
expected
batteries
die
after
charging
and
not
in
use
have
to
charge
them
immediately
prior
use
every
time
even
though
fully
charge
them
when
i'm
finished
using
them
my
son
recommended
these,
and
am
so
pleased
with
them
was
looking
for
something
that
was
light
weight
easy
to
wear
and
no
background
staticky
sounds
got
that
and
more,
great
sound
for
both
music
and
voice
love
the
long
time
charge,
and
range
in
distance
from
my
phone,
can
move
around
at
ease
love
them
feel
that
this
product
is
great
value
for
the
price
have
purchased
other
brands
at
much
higher
price
and
always
told
sounded
like
was
in
tin
can
or
underwater
people
can
actually
hear
me
and
not
the
background
noisealso
love
the
charging
case
display
showing
percentage
chargedi
am
also
very
happy
with
voice
assistant
working
well
with
the
samsung
9plus
phone,
all
do
is
press
the
mfb
button
three
times
and
say
ok
google
and
it
works
great
all
in
all
very
satisfied
with
this
purchase
this
headphones
are
by
far
the
best
have
tried
they
are
comfortable
to
wear
the
soud
quality
is
just
great
not
only
can
hear
the
music
or
who
ever
is
calling
me
but
they
can
hear
me
too
which
is
great
work
construction
so
this
are
great
customer
service
for
this
is
great
too
they
respond
quickly
and
actually
try
to
fix
whatever
issue
there
is
mine
was
just
links
not
working
for
my
warranty
wow
earbuds
have
sure
improved
love
the
clarity
and
noise
reduction
can
space
off
into
my
own
little
world
without
outside
distractions
charge
lasts
for
days,
i'm
sure
lov'in
them
soooo
easy
to
connect
the
first
time
buttons
on
the
buds
are
easy
and
logical,
none
of
that
down
is
up
business
like
the
sound
quality
but
can't
use
these
on
daily
basis
get
"low
battery"
warning
after
only
couple
of
hours
use
when
put
them
in
the
charging
case,
it
shows
them
almost
fully
charged
but
they
can't
be
used
because
it
won't
shut
up
also
can
fully
charge
the
earbuds
and
the
case
and
let
them
sit
for
couple
days
over
the
weekend
and
they
will
lose
much
of
the
charge
can't
use
them
wish
hadn't
picked
them
love
how
fast
they
arrived
and
love
how
they
fit
on
my
ear
super
comfy
lot
of
over
the
ear
buds
usually
are
not
comfy
but
these
are
and
live
that
because
can
not
wear
the
ones
that
fit
in
the
ear
directions
were
easy
to
follow
to
pair
with
my
phone
too
love
that
can
use
one
or
both
at
time
comfy
and
stays
in
my
ear,
no
problens
pairing
with
devices,
stays
charged
for
good
amount
of
time,
nice
case
to
charge
and
take
on
the
go
like
that
if
you're
not
using
the
headphones
after
so
long
they
will
turn
off
to
save
battery,
which
has
proven
helpful
use
for
zoom
calls
on
my
computer,
pair
with
my
phone
for
music
or
watching
movies
or
have
one
earbud
in
while
kids
watch
what
they
want
on
tv
and
can
listen
to
my
own
stuff,
also
use
for
working
out
and
sleeping
use
all
day
every
day
practically
this
is
my
first
ever
set
of
bluetooth
earbuds
and
love
em
no
more
cords
getting
in
my
way,
especially
with
how
active
am
and
my
little
kids
love
to
pull
cords
just
received
very
easy
sync
to
my
phone
test
call
was
okay,
we
ll
see
how
they
work
this
coming
work
week
not
sure
if
the
noise
canceling
will
be
desirable
or
notfor
music
they
do
sound
great
solid
bassupdate
two
days
later:
one
possible
concern
fully
charged
the
earbuds
and
after
48
hours
they
are
now
at
92%
based
on
the
charge
level
meter
in
the
case
so
they
lost
8%
of
the
charge
just
sitting
in
the
case
zero
usage
after
the
full
charge
i'm
not
sure
what's
causing
the
drain
on
the
battery,
maybe
the
case,
or
poor
battery
circuit
design
time
will
tell,
but
it
will
be
an
inconvenience
if
they
have
to
be
fully
charged
right
before
use
pleasantly
surprised
after
trying
apple
airbud
plus,
skull
candy
earbuds,
and
two
others
but
did
not
provide
length
of
battery
or
pairing
as
easy
or
every
time
as
advertisedalso
like
your
battery
case
that
shows
digitally
the
charge
paired
every
time
also
like
the
safety
of
over
the
ear
security
these
are
the
most
nonevasive
ear
buds
i've
ever
used;
very
comfortable
to
the
point
you
will
forget
they
are
even
there
they
also
stay
in
place
better
than
other
sets
i've
tried
that
tend
to
require
constant
readjustment
to
achevive
the
best
sound
quality
or
eliminate
the
feeling
that
they
just
might
fallout
altogether
if
you
don't
sound
quality
is
on
par
with
or
even
better
than
my
wired
headphones
that
all
but
dread
using
any
more
than
have
to
since
it
seems
that
the
harder
try
to
not
have
them
become
tangled
mess,
the
less
successful
am
in
doing
sothese
just
might
be
the
wireless
buds
you
can
buy
at
their
price
point
earbuds
are
great
we
have
two
parrots
and
they
squawk
at
every
little
noise
especially
the
tv,
music,
and
telephone
can
listen
to
my
podcasts,
music
and
watch
tv
and
our
parrots
are
quiet
all
the
sound
comes
through
the
earbuds
without
disturbing
them
then
when
done
can
talk
up
storm
with
them
lol
really
wanted
these
headphones
to
work
reliably
my
first
pair
had
disconnect
issues
on
the
right
headphone
intermittently,
then
the
case
pins
broke
out
for
the
right
headset
week
later,
making
it
not
able
to
chargei
got
replacement
unit
shipped
out
in
three
days,
and
while
this
one
did
not
"break",
have
constant
connection
loss
on
only
the
right
headset
when
my
device
is
only
feet
away,
which
was
exactly
what
was
happening
with
the
first
pairunless
occiam
can
fix
their
quality
control
issues,
would
say
this
is
not
headset
you
want
to
invest
in
have
samsung
buds
and
was
having
trouble
with
them
hurting
my
small
ears
decided
to
give
these
headphones
try
was
shocked
by
how
good
they
worked
can
wear
them
all
day
and
they
do
not
hurt
my
ears
the
battery
life
of
the
headphones
and
the
case
far
surpasses
that
of
my
much
more
expensive
galaxy
buds
do
not
second
guess
buying
pair
you
will
not
regret
it
as
far
as
sound
quality
and
noise
canceling
these
are
pretty
awesome
battery
life
is
great
too
where
the
problem
lies,
however
is
the
charging
case
it
feels
cheap,
and
within
30
minutes
of
getting
the
earbuds
the
case
broke
pin
that
holds
the
hinge
in
fell
out
it
still
functions
but
it
doesn
stay
closed
and
the
lid
falls
off
when
opened
besides
that
they
re
great
like
these
lot
the
fit
is
good
and
the
sound
quality
is
very
good
the
price
is
great
for
what
you
get
the
battery
life
is
adequate,
i'd
prefer
for
them
to
last
longer,
but
for
the
price,
it's
not
dealbreaker
the
pros
are
the
sound
quality
and
fit
con
is
i'd
like
them
to
last
longer
stopped
working
after
months
of
light
use
never
dropped,
no
water
damage
or
anything
like
that
just
using
them
couple
of
times
per
week
while
working
out
or
to
listen
to
music
or
videos
on
my
phone
the
case
refuses
to
charge,
have
tried
different
cables
nothing
the
headphones
charge
via
the
case,
so
the
whole
system
is
brokenrequested
replacement
from
amazon
as
it
was
still
within
return
period
we
ll
see
how
those
ones
are
these
are
just
what
was
looking
for
airpods
don
fit
my
ears
well
and
could
never
exercise
in
them
didn
want
to
spend
hundreds
of
dollars
for
something
only
use
occasionally
these
have
really
good
sound
quality
and
stay
pretty
secure
in
my
ear
they
come
with
different
size
tips
and
like
that
the
charging
case
shows
the
battery
percentage
also
like
that
my
husband
and
can
each
wear
one
at
the
same
time
overall
quite
happy
with
my
purchase
i'm
loving
my
new
headphones
love
that
they
last
so
long
really
nice
for
long
runs,
cleaning,
and
super
long
audio
books
and
that
can
just
throw
them
in
the
mini
case
to
charge
instead
of
plugging
them
in
also
love
that
can
use
one
at
time
to
really
maximize
how
long
go
without
needing
to
charge
these
headphone
are
exactly
as
advertised
and
perfect
for
my
needs
also
love
that
they
don't
have
cords
hanging
down
from
them
to
make
it
easy
for
my
month
old
to
yank
out
of
my
ear
these
earbuds
are
great
for
onthego
have
been
using
them
for
running
and
they
stay
on
well
the
battery
life
is
nice
and
long
and
they
are
super
easy
to
charge
the
charging
case
is
great
to
protect
and
recharge
the
earbuds
during
longer
outings
am
very
pleased
with
these
earbuds
and
highly
recommend
them
bought
these
wireless
headphones
for
my
husband
and
he
thinks
with
sound
quality
on
music,
the
stereo
effect
is
wounderful
listening
to
book
good
but
could
be
better
sound
noise
cancelling
very
good
only
had
these
short
time
so
can
not
say
much
at
this
time
about
the
battery
life
good
quality
and
soundupdate
did
anyone
else
scratch
off
the
card
in
the
box
and
it
said
you
won
another
pair
of
headphones
followed
the
steps
and
gave
the
amazon
review
and
hopes
that
might
get
better
pair
than
the
ones
that
got
yeah
they're
okay
and
they
work
but
the
ones
had
before
this
from
enacfire
were
much
better
after
leaving
my
review
which
they
asked,
and
they
told
me
would
be
sent
out
an
additional
pair
of
headphones
in
days
it's
been
11
days
and
i've
seen
nothing
these
are
comfortable
and
wireless
battery
live
seems
huge
case
has
battery
which
is
nice
would
have
liked
smaller
case
or
maybe
not
quite
as
cheap
feeling,
but
the
headphones
are
amazing
true
test
of
noise
cancelation
is
air
travel,
but
that's
not
happening
so
can't
say
for
sure
about
that
do
find
that
don't
have
to
turn
the
volume
up
as
loud
on
my
phone
to
hear
them
they
are
clear
and
clean
sounding,
lite
very
nice
would
buy
again
bought
these
for
my
son
and
he
loves
them
he
takes
them
everywhere
with
him
they
are
light
weight
and
have
long
battery
life
great
product
and
sound
qualities
was
bit
nervous
to
buy
these,
as
the
price
point
seemed
too
good
to
be
true,
but
am
so
glad
that
bought
them
they
are
great
value
for
your
money
buy
with
confidence
had
to
pair
them
with
my
phone
couple
times
and
the
battery
life
wasn't
great
at
first,
but
after
couple
uses
and
recharges
they
are
performing
great
don't
write
them
off
if
they
don't
meet
expectations
on
their
first
usesound
is
great
with
both
music
and
phone
calls
earbud
hooks
fit
comfortably
over
my
ears
and
barely
notice
have
them
on
being
able
to
recharge
the
earbuds
in
the
charging
case
without
wall
outlet
is
convenient
fully
charged
case
can
recharge
the
earbuds
or
times
before
needing
to
be
recharged
itselfcustomer
support
has
been
very
responsive
while
worked
through
my
issues
elevating
their
value
beyond
what
could
have
been
just
set
of
low
priced
headphones
they
look
good,
fit
really
comfortably
and
they
sound
better
than
expected
the
charging
case
looks
sleek
didn
realize
how
well
the
noise
canceling
worked
until
my
wife
was
talking
to
me
from
10
feet
away
and
had
no
idea
because
couldn
hear
her,
money
well
spent
ll
probably
buy
some
of
these
as
gifts
too,
they
are
that
good
selected
these
because
wanted
compact,
lowprofile
earbud
that
would
not
fall
out
when
running
and
could
be
used
together
or
individually
sound
quality
has
been
excellent,
and
have
had
no
complaints
from
the
other
side
of
my
conversations
about
excessive
wind
or
other
ambient
noises
love
the
protective
charging
case
too
so
far
am
very
happy
with
this
product
it
paired
very
easily
with
my
ipad
addition,
the
support
team
for
this
product
seems
very
responsive
when
it
came
to
registering
the
warranty
the
sound
is
pretty
good
for
the
price
of
these
earbuds,
and
they
stay
secure,
which
is
the
reason
bought
them
got
this
product
to
use
for
calls
in
the
car,
cleaning
at
the
house,
and
stocking
at
work
after
hours
they're
perfect
they're
small,
the
power
reserve/charging
case
is
perfect
my
music
sounds
great
my
test
for
noise
canceling
is
snap
and
clap
can
hear
both
without
music
of
course,
if
my
music
is
at
mid
volume
can
faintly
hear
clap
but
not
snap
honestly
these
are
perfect
and
exactly
what
was
looking
forwhen
they
arrived
had
problem
with
the
left
bud
not
connecting,
didn't
even
seem
to
be
charging
came
back
to
the
product
and
found
video
to
fix
it
that
took
no
time
at
all
this
is
my
first
set
of
earbuds
was
kind
of
worried
to
buy
them
because
didn't
know
much
about
them,
but
after
reading
the
review's
said
lets
try
them
well
made
great
decision
they
happened
to
be
left
in
my
coat
jacket
and
went
through
the
wash
boy
was
made,
but
let
them
dry
out
and
come
to
find
out
they
work
good
as
new
first
off,
the
sound
quality
for
me
only
seems
like
it
designed
for
music
there
lot
of
bass
to
the
earbuds,
almost
enough
to
barely
here
the
artist
singing
or
rapping
they
do
have
tiny
volume
adjusters
on
the
top,
which
for
me
they
need
to
be
bit
bigger
for
larger
hands
love
how
try
so
hard
to
shake
them
out
of
my
ear
they
won
even
fall
out,
always
plus
for
these
kind
of
earbuds
believe
you
can
have
one
turned
on
while
the
other
one
is
charging
and
the
distance
from
which
you
can
use
one
from
the
other
is
better
than
most
like
said
in
the
beginning
though,
tested
out
how
they
are
on
calling
and
it
very
muffled
even
on
max
volume
but
good
thing
can
here
anything
the
sounds
quality
is
very
good
for
the
price
of
these
headphones
they
seamlessly
connect
to
your
phone
the
charging
case
shows
how
much
both
have
battery
and
how
much
the
case
does
the
earpiece
is
little
large
so
smaller
ears
might
not
be
comfortable
but
it
is
comfortable
to
me
they
hang
nicely
in
and
on
your
ear
my
husband
loves
them
my
husband
is
sweater,
sweats
like
waterfall
from
his
head,
he
goes
to
the
gym
5x/week
and
has
used
them
everyday
since
christmas
when
he
got
them
he
has
not
had
to
charge
them
yet
connection
is
excellent
sweatproof
is
holding
up
great
he
can't
hear
me
when
i'm
trying
to
get
his
attention
from
treadmill
feet
away
from
him,
so
have
to
wave
like
crazy
person
his
only
con
would
be
the
sound
quality,
as
he
did
give
it
4star
he
said
you
can't
hear
the
low,
base
sound
very
well,
but
its
crisp
clear
sound
overall
still
worth
getting
these
are
exactly
what
he
needed
to
be
"free"
at
the
gym
we
are
very
pleased
was
skeptical
of
the
quality
of
these
earphones
for
the
price
but
am
pleasently
surprised
they
are
very
lightweight
and
comfortable,
sound
quality
is
exceptional
had
small
issue
with
the
volume
control
but
customer
service
was
in
touch
within
hours
and
am
most
satisfied
so
far
am
pleased
with
my
purchase
the
headphone
batteries
do
last
long
time
i've
gotten
about
hours
of
continuous
use
from
them
on
one
charge
the
display
on
the
left
side
of
the
charger
is
pretty
accurate
find
it
very
helpful
the
display
on
the
right
doesn't
always
light
up
for
both
batteries
don't
pay
attention
to
it
and
rely
on
my
android
phone
to
tell
me
how
much
charge
there
is
as
for
sound
quality,
i'm
not
connoisseur
of
bass,
etc,
but
in
my
opinion
the
quality
is
pretty
good
was
able
to
get
an
additional
20%
off
from
amazon
so
it
made
my
purchase
pretty
good
deal
regardless,
you
can
great
set
of
headphones
for
good
price
sent
back
earbuds
from
another
company
and
bought
these
ones
wear
them
all
day
long
they
don
hurt
your
inner
ear
and
the
sound
of
great
very
easy
to
operate
love
these
they
go
around
your
car
so
if
you
re
busy
as
normally
am,
you
don
need
to
wort
about
them
falling
out
this
is
great
bang
for
the
buck,
good
bass
and
decent
range
the
power
meter
is
nice
touch
as
is
the
option
to
use
either
ear
bud
independently
if
you
get
too
far
out
of
range
it
will
start
cutting
out
but
if
you're
within
2030
feet
direct
line
of
sight
it
stays
paired
the
sound
quality
is
good
for
both
phone
calls
and
for
music,
especially
for
the
price
point
1st
star
its
comfortable
2nd
star
and
the
ability
to
hook
over
the
ear
makes
it
great
for
going
to
the
gym
or
bike
riding
3rd
star
also
love
the
charging
case
and
battery
life
which
works
wonders
for
someone
like
me
who
is
constantly
out
of
the
house
4th
star
where
it
loses
its
5th
star
is
the
connectivity
could
literally
have
my
phone
in
my
hand,
not
even
feet
away
from
the
t17's
and
will
lose
sound
in
one
of
the
ear
pieces
for
longer
than
1520
seconds
this
happens
when
my
phone
is
in
my
pocket
or
on
my
bikes
phone
holder
this
connectivity
issue
drives
me
crazy
was
little
upset
to
see
that
they
give
you
card
for
amazon
gift
card
only
if
you
give
star
rating,
so
decided
to
wait
in
order
to
leave
an
accurate
review
my
headset
was
working
good
but
then
after
uses
they
would
start
to
cut
out
and
have
static
noise
to
them
the
right
one
would
cut
out
completely
and
then
return
it
annoying
fits
so
well
you'll
forget
you're
wearing
it
have
it
on
even
when
nothing
is
playing
and
just
take
calls
from
it
because
forget
it's
there
battery
life
indicator
is
amazing
case
charges
super
fast,
under
hour
thankfully
it
uses
the
same
charger
as
my
samsung
s8
edge
so
can
charge
my
phone
on
the
case
too
brought
these
and
really
was
impressed
it
sounds
good
lot
of
bass
would
have
giving
it
star
for
it
being
really
good
headphones
but
the
ear
bud
piece
would
not
stay
in
my
ear
would
lose
sounds
so
brought
some
memory
foams
ear
buds
for
it
and
what
big
difference
now
it
sounds
great
so
for
those
that
are
interest
in
buying
these
you
may
want
to
buy
the
memory
foam
ear
piece
for
it
together
it
sounds
great
happy
with
my
purchase
took
the
headphones
out
of
the
box,
put
them
in
my
ears,
paired
them
to
phone,
turned
on
pandora
and
they
started
working
immediately
the
sound
was
excellent
and
the
fit
was
very
comfortable
very
pleasant
surprise
haven
been
able
to
use
them
on
phone
call
yet
or
check
the
battery
time
span
but
if
it
anything
like
the
sound
and
fit
plus
the
ease
of
setup
they
ll
be
more
than
worth
the
cost
of
them
was
wanting
pair
of
earphones
that
would
fit
well
into
my
ear
love
the
behind
the
ear
bands
to
help
hold
the
ear
buds
into
place
in
addition
the
ear
buds
sort
of
rotate
into
place
and
so
they
seat
well
into
the
ear
canal,
providing
optimal
sound
quality
in
using
the
microphone
feature
was
told
that
sounded
good
but
was
little
softer
on
their
end
overall
very
satisfied
thus
far
with
my
purchase
my
first
pair
didn't
work
very
well
the
volume
function
didn't
work
and
the
connection
was
iffy
ordered
replacement
pair
and
it
was
sent
out
to
me
fast
have
had
hard
time
finding
comfortable
pair
of
earbuds,
but
these
do
the
trick
at
reasonable
price
thanks
just
received
the
headphones
today
followed
the
directions
and
charged
them
first
could
not
find
bluetooth
setting
on
my
sony
smart
tv
have
to
use
bluetooth
transmitter
off
the
headphone
port
which
causes
lag
in
the
sound
works
perfect
using
my
computer,
tablet
and
phone
so
far,
i've
been
enjoying
the
headphones
they're
not
too
tight
around
my
ears,
the
audio
comes
in
rather
clearly,
and
it's
lot
easier
to
make
sure
it's
charging
compared
to
my
last
set
of
bluetooth
headphones
the
only
issue
i've
ever
had
is
if
both
headphones
aren't
synced
at
the
same
time
then
it
can
lead
to
few
audio
issues
but
this
is
easily
remedied
for
me
by
just
resetting
the
headphones
in
their
case
or
turning
them
on/off
again
to
make
sure
they
sync
up
properly
with
my
phone
otherwise
they've
worked
wonderfully
for
my
needs
thus
far
these
ear
buds
are
about
what
you
pay
for
my
pair
connects
to
my
phone
and
plays
music
but
believe
my
left
ear
bud
is
defective
it
will
randomly
power
off,
only
to
come
back
on
in
about
30
seconds
they
also
do
not
fit
my
ears
as
well
as
other
over
the
ear
ear
buds
have
had
before
finally,
they
do
not
get
very
loud
and
you
can
tell
the
sound
quality
is
not
great
it
does,
however,
have
great
battery
life
and
the
charging
case
lasts
even
longer
overall
i'm
bit
disappointed
in
these
ear
buds
but
guess
get
what
pay
for
had
these
since
oct
and
was
working
great
but
the
case
to
charge
the
ear
buds
has
completely
stopped
working
was
star
but
updated
to
starscompany
has
reached
out
and
has
explained
they
have
switched
manufacturers
to
fix
this
problem
and
offered
me
refund
product
was
good
and
sound
was
awesome
it
was
just
the
case
would
recommend
the
product
since
they
have
fixed
the
issue
wish
that
could
give
lower
review
purchased
these
in
anticipation
of
the
winter
season,
and
boring
indoor
training
sessions
when
finally
unboxed
them
to
charge
for
their
first
use,
only
one
side
would
take
charge
sound
quality
with
only
one
side
working
is
poor
suppose
it
is
partially
my
own
fault
for
waiting
so
long
to
test
the
functionality
of
the
product
i'm
one
of
those
unreasonable
types
who
simply
expects
things
to
work
as
they
should
these
don't
have
microphone,
which
makes
me
really
angry
honestly
since
bought
them
so
can
use
them
for
wireless
calls
at
work
as
well
as
gaming
for
when
i'm
homenow
i'll
only
wear
them
when
workout
they
look
really
nice,
but
they
are
audio
only
ordered
this
product
cause
needed
earbuds
that
wont
fall
off
my
ears
when
jogging
they
stay
in
place
perfectly,
the
sound
in
incredible
and
they
block
out
reasonably
amount
of
sound
dont
jog
all
day
so
cant
say
much
bout
battery
life
but
walk
few
hours
also
with
great
connection
for
what
need
them
for
just
got
these
for
my
boyfriend
the
sound
quality
is
great
for
the
price
both
for
the
wearer
him
and
for
me
when
he
calls
me
he
comes
through
crystal
clear
the
loop
is
comfortable
these
are
nice
earphones
the
case
is
bit
weak
so
be
careful
but
overall
very
good
ear
buds
came
in
nice
case
that
is
also
the
recharging
station
they
fit
comfortably
in
my
ears
and
stay
put
even
at
65mph
on
motorcycle
they
pair
quickly
and
have
great
sound
charged
them
to
100%
and
listened
to
music
for
about
hours
and
battery
was
still
at
80%
would
easily
recommend
these
these
earbuds
were
okay,
bass
wasn
as
deep
as
advertised
the
hooks
around
the
ears
were
satisfyingly
comfortable
gave
the
earbuds
to
my
nephew
other
earphones
have
not
worked
at
all
with
my
acer
laptop
the
occiam
set
paired
with
my
laptop
immediately
do
online
psychotherapy
and
having
these
wireless
earbuds
is
great
addition
for
me
the
earphones
fitting
on
around
my
ears
is
very
good
fit
also
so
far
hours
have
not
been
able
to
pair
with
my
motog7
phone
so
will
check
with
motog
and
with
occiam
as
needed
to
get
the
pairing
done
these
are
an
excellent
fit
and
good
sound,
not
matched
at
all
other
wireless
units
have
tried
love
these
audiphonesthey're
very
comfortable
and
they
don't
move
from
their
place
despite
strong
movementsthe
most
important
thing
is
the
good
sound
it
has
and
the
cancellation
of
external
sounds
is
pretty
good
and
the
quality
and
price
relationship
makes
me
impressed
would
recommend
these
audiphones
to
anyone
who
wants
good
sound
without
spending
much
these
were
present
to
my
brother
he
messaged
me
too
say
these
are
"awesome"
the
sound
quality
is
loud
and
clear,
they
stay
in
his
ears
while
he
is
working
he
has
physical
job
where
he
moves
around
lot,
and
the
battery
life
was
still
at
50%
after
an
8hr
shift
wonderful
fit,
quality
and
noise
cancellation
unfortunately
for
me,
the
charging
contacts
are
on
the
inside
of
the
headphones
and
come
into
contact
with
your
skinsince
have
an
allergy
to
nickel,
the
contacts
made
me
develop
painful
rash
will
be
giving
these
to
my
husband
to
use
and
had
to
order
different
design
good
product,
they
fit
well
around
the
ears
and
are
flexible
in
size
had
little
trouble
figuring
out
how
to
go
from
pairing
one
at
time
to
both
sides,
since
either
earpiece
can
work
independently
of
the
other
overall
really
great
product,
would
get
it
again
they
sound
really
good,
easy
to
use,
and
comfortable
on
my
ears
i'm
now
on
day
and
the
buds
stop
working
for
voicecalls
after
few
hours
but
will
work
for
musicalso
my
case
will
not
charge
it
arrived
at
70%
charged
it
for
days
and
now
it's
at
44%
needed
to
make
sure
found
pair
of
earbuds
that
wouldn't
fall
out
of
my
ear,
and
honestly,
wasn't
in
the
mood
to
drop
$75+
on
it
and
think
we
hit
jackpot
with
this
right
here
sound
quality,
think
is
better
then
apple
airpods,
if
not,
at
least
on
par
with
them
especially
for
the
price
point,
awesome
earbuds
comfortable
fit,
easy
one
time
syncing
to
my
phone,
love
the
battery
display
on
the
included
charging
dock
great
audio,
my
friends
don't
complain
that
sound
far
away
or
they
can
hear
themselves
while
am
using
these
worth
the
price
and
would
def
buy
again
very
comfortable
for
long
periods
of
time
and
does
not
interfere
with
my
eye
glasses
the
bass
is
amazing
have
small
ear
canals
and
inear
buds
cause
me
jaw
fatigue
changed
the
buds
to
the
small
version
and
barely
know
they
are
there
update
after
week
usage:
one
of
the
earbud
right
one
stopped
working
not
sure
what
can
do
about
it
guess
there
is
no
guarantee
for
this
product
it
hit
or
miss
if
the
product
works
it
value
for
money
for
me
it
hasn
workedthese
are
great
pair
of
earphones
in
this
price
range
probably
one
of
the
best
ones
very
good
battery
life,
connect
easily
without
any
issues
or
delays
ve
had
issues
with
earphones
staying
out
in
my
ear
and
these
are
helping
me
overcome
the
issue
these
were
easy
to
set
up
and
get
connected,
no
issues
during
the
setup
process
the
sound
quality
is
decent,
it's
not
as
crisp
as
high
quality
head
phones
or
earbuds,
but
the
bass
on
them
is
good
they
don't
have
"hollow"
noise
feel
to
them,
the
sound
is
full,
just
not
as
crisp
as
would
like
but
for
the
price
and
the
fact
that
they're
bluetooth,
i'll
give
them
passoverall
they're
pretty
solid,
if
you're
looking
for
some
cheap,
wireless
earbuds,
with
decent
sound,
then
these
are
the
buds
to
get
so
far
so
good
for
$30
pair
of
earbuds,
they
are
certainly
loud
and
have
great
bass
to
them
do
have
small
issue
with
the
mid
range
of
them
and
how
finicky
they
are
in
my
ears
while
im
stretching
while
im
running,
they
stay
in
place
and
sound
great
as
far
as
customer
service
so
far,
sammi
chen

change
tone
does
not
work
all
the
time
purchased
set
of
these
occiam
earbuds
about
10
days
ago
they
are
pretty
amazing
good
bass
line,
no
crackles,
connects
easily
and
automatically,
both
to
one
another
and
to
control
devices
i'm
definitely
thrilled
with
their
shape;
cannot
wear
standard
earbuds
due
to
my
inner
ear
shape,
so
the
ones
that
hug
the
shell
of
your
ear
are
so
much
more
reliable
was
also
concerned
that
would
run
into
the
price
ledge
that
standard
earbuds
fall
into,
where
you
have
to
fork
over
some
serious
cash
these
were
affordable
and
definitely
worth
their
price
i'm
in
love
with
them
:
was
waiting
for
$35
set
of
earbuds,
however
these
are
easily
worth
twice
as
much
have
issues
with
earbuds
hurting
my
ears
and
giving
me
headaches
after
using
them
for
too
long
wore
these
for
hours
straight
yesterday
and
no
pain
or
headache
would
recommend
to
anyone
looking
for
good
reasonably
priced
bluetooth
earphones
didn't
even
have
them
for
one
day
the
headphones
would
strictly
only
connect
to
my
phones
bluetooth
calling
capabilities
and
not
the
overall
media
of
the
phone
the
case
is
nice
and
pretty
but
the
headphones
sounded
terrible
didn't
get
to
hear
much
due
to
me
not
being
able
to
actually
connect
to
the
media
on
my
phone
but
the
"connected"
and
"disconnected"
tones
heard
in
the
earbuds
sounded
awful
really
like
that
the
base
charges
with
usbc
so
do
not
have
to
tote
another
cable
around
the
battery
life
is
very
goodz
and
like
that
you
can
just
use
one
side,
either
infact,
when
the
situation
is
appropriate
they
are
comfortable
to
wear
and
like
the
over
the
ear
design
so
do
not
have
to
worry
about
them
falling
out
during
physical
activity
sound
quality
is
comparable
to
other
styles
overall
for
the
price
am
very
satisfied
and
would
recommend
them
these
bluetooth
earphones
fit
snugly
to
the
ear,
which
is
great
for
any
activity
the
color
and
design
is
sleek
and
nice,
not
to
mention
the
battery
display
on
the
charging
case
is
pretty
cool
sound
quality
is
consistently
great
as
opposed
to
few
others
have
tried
that
would
randomly
drop
in
quality
the
only
problem
have
found
this
far
is
that
few
friends
of
mine
have
commented
that
my
voice
sounds
distant/muffled
still,
well
worth
the
price
and
the
support
is
friendly
these
are
awesome
haven
had
good
luck
with
ear
buds
so
was
going
to
spend
more
money
on
set
saw
all
the
reviews
and
decided
to
give
it
try
these
work
fantastically
and
they
actually
stay
in
place
as
well
what
great
deal,
you
won
be
sorry
great
fit
on
my
ears
love
the
multiple
sizes
of
caps
the
sound
is
very
good
and
the
noise
cancelling
is
very
good
haven't
had
an
trouble
with
the
bluetooth
connection,
and
haven't
heard
any
songs
skipping
either
would
buy
these
again
can't
believe
all
these
star
reviews
this
product
didn't
work
for
me
out
of
the
box
the
volume
up
and
down
don't
work
properly
the
sound
quality
is
poor
i've
had
less
expensive
ear
buds
that
had
much
better
sound
they
feel
cheaply
made
these
are
pretty
nice
earphones
for
the
price
the
battery
last
pretty
long
and
the
earpieces
fit
snug
but
comfortable
stays
on
even
my
ears
even
during
intense
workouts
the
sound
quality
is
below
average
however
for
under
$30
its
to
be
expected
probably
one
of
the
nicest
set
of
earbuds
daughter
loves
the
sound
quality,
the
design,
battery
life,
and
the
bass
she's
even
suggested
buy
pair
so,
just
might
do
that
overall,
makes
great
gift
with
lot
of
great
sound
❤
❤
had
these
for
couple
of
workouts
now
and
appreciate
that
they
don't
shake
loose
like
others
i've
tried
i'm
also
really
appreciating
the
power
level
readouts
for
both
the
case
and
for
each
earphone
makes
it
easy
to
confirm
the
earphones
are
secure
and
charging
when
placed
in
the
case
you
really
can't
go
wrong
buying
these
because
of
the
affordable
price
got
them
for
my
mom
who
is
not
the
most
techsavvy
person,
so
the
individual
volume
control
and
pause
buttons
on
each
earbud
were
easy
for
her
to
use
she
also
likes
the
clear
displays
that
let
her
know
when
she
needs
to
recharge
the
sound
is
great
for
the
price
and
they
stay
on
so
she
can
use
these
while
she
cleans
the
house
overall
happy
with
the
purchase
so
far
bought
these
for
my
husbands
birthday
and
he
absolutely
loved
them
he
impressed
with
how
comfortable
they
are
and
how
they
fit
perfectly
the
battery
life
is
amazing
and
the
sound
quality
is
also
really
good
and
the
charging
case
is
small
so
it
easy
to
carry
around
these
occiam
earbuds
are
awesome
the
sound
quality
is
so
crisp
and
clear
have
the
galaxy
earbuds
which
got
for
$200
isnt
even
as
clear
as
these
ones
you
can
turn
the
volume
to
max
and
no
static
whatsoever
i've
been
working
out
with
it
for
2hrs
day
for
the
past
days
and
the
battery
is
still
at
100%
because
the
case
charges
the
earbuds
you
can't
go
wrong
with
these
stars
for
this
product
customer
service
is
awesome
as
well
if
you
email
them,
they
response
to
you
within
hours
its
only
been
couple
months
but
my
wife
loves
it
and
asked
me
to
leave
positive
review
for
it
it
is
comfortable
for
her
and
the
battery
life
is
pretty
good
for
her
use
she
has
online
classes
and
can
listen
to
her
teacher
while
she's
doing
something
else
around
the
house
your
browser
does
not
support
html5
video
love
these
earbuds
they
are
comfortable
and
have
excellent
sound
quality
like
that
it
has
buttons
to
change
volume
and
songs
vs
touch
sensor
it
was
super
easy
to
pair
out
of
the
box
love
that
the
charging
case
shows
charge
for
ear
earbud
but
the
case
does
drain
bit
when
not
in
use
really
shocked
by
how
good
these
headphones
are
for
the
price
the
battery
is
crazy
long,
the
case
is
pretty
cool
and
tells
you
how
much
battery
is
left
in
both
headphones,
and
the
quality
of
the
headphones
themselves
is
fabulous
definitely
great
at
cancelling
out
lot
of
outside
noise
highly
recommend
they
also
come
with
different
inner
ear
fittings
so
you
can
get
the
proper
comfort
one
of
the
main
reasons
bought
this
was
because
my
other
headphone's
microphone
did
not
work
well
but
this
one
does
work
and
the
person
talked
to
through
this
headphone
said
that
they
could
hear
me
well
besides,
the
other
features
seem
to
be
working
properly
needed
good
pair
of
headphones
to
use
and
didn't
want
to
spend
the
money
on
more
expensive
pair
i've
been
using
them
so
far
for
virtual
zooming
and
also
for
going
for
runs
outside
they've
worked
great
and
easily
in
both
scenarios
connecting
to
my
laptop
and
then
to
my
phone
only
downside
and
it's
probably
the
case
with
other
types
of
bluetooth
headphones
is
that
have
to
unpair
them
from
one
device
for
them
to
be
able
to
be
paired
and
connected
to
the
other
but
it
takes
seconds
to
do
that
so
really
not
big
deal
got
it
today
paired
with
phone
no
issues
yet
seems
to
be
working
it
appears
that
this
item
may
have
been
returned
by
some
one
will
observe
and
decide
about
getting
replacement
later
so
far
works
ok
will
update
my
review
was
looking
for
overtheear
bluetooth
headphones
for
running/hiking
and
these
fit
the
bill
other
models
are
pain
to
charge
because
you
don't
know
when
it's
done
until
the
light
changes,
but
occiam
gives
you
the
exact
%
of
the
charge
if
you're
looking
for
topoftheline
quality,
this
isn't
it
but
in
the
under
$50,
you're
unlikely
to
find
better
bang
for
your
buck
no
complaints
wonderful
product
my
husband
absolutely
loves
these
earbuds
they
are
wireless
such
great
buy
connected
right
away
to
his
phone
and
easy
to
use
instructions
what
are
you
waiting
for
go
get
you
pair
you
will
not
be
disappointed
love
these
headphones
they
definitely
last
all
day
while
work
ten
hour
shifts
like
how
there
actual
buttons
on
the
headphones,
my
old
ones
had
sensor
button
and
it
was
hard
to
use
sometimes
they
stay
in
place
while
run
and
play
tennis
would
recommend
this
brand
wow
these
buds
are
amazing;
the
base
sound
is
fantastic;
super
easy
to
set
up,
had
only
taken
it
out
of
the
box
and
it
was
already
in
pairing
mode
automatically
walked
all
over
the
house
2800
sq
ftwithout
losing
connectivity
these
need
to
be
plugged
in
all
the
time
to
maintain
the
charge
as
it
seems
to
me
that
they
cannot
be
powered
off
once
you
place
them
in
the
charger
case
don't
like
inear
headphones
they
don't
ever
stay
in
my
ears
so
gave
these
try
very
affordable
and
work
great
they
stay
put
and
are
very
comfortable
the
sound
is
great
and
they
link
up
quick
and
easy
highly
recommend
these
headphones
are
super
cool
and
function
really
well
the
sound
is
clear
and
use
them
while
on
my
exercise
bike,
and
can
hear
my
program
perfectly
very
nice
chic
case
great
battery
life
panel
these
hooked
up
very
easily
to
my
phone
great
buy
earbuds
are
easy
to
connect
to
devices
and
have
long
battery
life
includes
magnetic
case
to
store
and
charge
them
in
my
daughter
uses
them
for
virtual
school
and
loves
them
the
noise
cancellation
helps
her
to
focus
in
class
couldn
ask
for
better
product
for
the
price
just
received
my
earbuds
and
am
very
happy
with
the
sound
quality
they
were
so
simple
to
charge
and
pair,
was
using
them
within
minutes
of
arrival
on
my
doorstep
previously
purchased
pair
from
another
vendor
and
could
not
get
them
to
pair
was
so
pleased
this
set
paired
so
easily
this
is
good
product
and
recommend
purchase
was
looking
for
set
of
over
the
ear
earbuds
as
my
current
ones
don't
like
to
stay
in
when
i'm
moving
around
and
all
came
across
these
and
was
curious
one
thing
really
liked
was
each
earbud
could
be
used
independently
ive
had
them
for
few
days
now
and
am
enjoying
them
sound
quality
is
awesome
would
recommend
theseupdate:
to
add
to
this
did
run
into
small
issue
with
the
earbuds
contacted
their
customer
service
and
they
took
care
of
it
like
these
occiam
bluetooth
headphones
because
they
stayed
in
place
during
my
hard
core
hiit
sessions,
weight
training,
and
advanced
yoga
they
never
once
fell
out
of
my
ears
although
had
small
ear
lobes
the
sound
quality
has
been
great
and
have
had
no
issues
with
the
connection
or
pairing
with
my
iphone
the
charging
case
has
been
working
well
and
the
battery
of
the
headphones
lasted
through
my
2hour
work
out
sessions
with
the
headphones
being
water
resistant,
they
have
been
holding
up
although
sweated
lot
during
my
work
out
these
ear
buds
are
great
they
are
light
weight
and
easy
to
set
up
and
operate
right
from
the
box
the
sound
quality
is
great
and
the
wrap
around
ear
supports
are
comfortable
to
wear
returned
pair
of
wireless
bluetooth
buds
from
another
vendor
that
didn't
have
the
wrap
around
ear
support
because
they
were
too
heavy
and
kept
falling
out
of
my
ear
whenever
turned
my
head
too
quickly
these
buds
stay
put
and
come
with
three
sizes
of
the
ear
inserts
for
large
to
small
size
ear
canals
the
buttons
are
easy
to
operate
and
preferable
over
the
one
touch
button
system
on
other
buds
love
the
charging
case
too
these
earbuds
are
great
the
sound
quality
is
wonderful
and
had
no
issues
pairing
these
with
both
my
laptop
and
my
samsung
galaxy
s9
great
little
product
and
customer
service
is
awesome
too
update:
the
company
reached
out
and
refunded
me
for
changing
this
review
to
five
starbasically
what
it
says
in
the
headline
when
they're
working,
they
work
very
well
often
though,
one
or
both
of
them
start
cutting
in
and
out
and
it
sounds
like
the
audio
is
bouncing
back
and
forth
on
either
side
of
my
head
if
you
are
looking
for
quality
wireless
headphones
for
great
price,
you
found
them
have
had
these
for
few
days
now
and
have
nothing
but
great
things
to
say
about
them
so
far
they
are
very
comfortable
to
wear
for
hours
at
time
they
come
with
the
medium
size
earbud
tip
installed
but
pair
of
small
and
large
tips
are
in
the
box
small
is
little
more
comfortable
for
me,
glad
to
have
that
option
pairing
and
operation
is
easy
enough
for
anyone
to
figure
out
sound
quality
for
both
music
and
voice
calls
are
fantastic
for
the
price
would
definitely
purchase
these
again
sound
quality,
noise
cancellation,
and
battery
life
all
seem
fine
so
far,
no
particular
problems
or
qualmsi'm
not
an
audiophile
or
anything
so
i'm
only
using
it
for
listening
to
videos
and
some
music
on
youtubethey
seem
to
stay
in
my
ears
even
when
move
my
head
around
to
the
music
so
that's
nicei
like
the
interface,
big
simple
numbers
and
bars,
simple
straightforward
instructions,
etcjust
to
note,
they
have
deal
for
lifetime
warranty
for
star
reviews
so
that's
probably
skewing
the
scores,
but
on
the
whole
they
seem
fine
enough
anyway
seriously,
right
out
of
the
box
these
felt
and
looked
like
great
quality
crazy
easy
to
connect
to
my
phone,
the
sound
was
great
when
turned
on
my
music
and
my
phone
calls
were
crisp
and
clear
on
both
sides
stoked
bought
these
for
snowboarding
so
i'll
update
you
on
your
week
these
work
after
this
weekend
friend
of
mine
bought
these
and
recommended
them
was
looking
to
replace
my
old
anker
bt
earbuds
so
thought
give
them
tryi
impressed
so
far
they
re
not
airpods,
but
at
fraction
of
the
price
they
re
great
value
the
sound
is
good
and
every
phone
call
ve
made
sounded
clear
on
both
ends
the
fit
is
very
comfortable
even
for
small
ears
really
like
the
digital
display
in
the
charging
case
and
it
does
superb
job
of
filtering
out
background
noise
they
also
hold
charge
well
would
definitely
buy
again
these
are
so
much
more
comfortable
than
the
earbuds
without
ear
hooks
can
wear
hat
cold
weather
and
the
ear
bud
would
fall
out
no
problem
with
comfortable
ear
hook
picks
up
phone
calls
easily
sound
quality
excellent
case
is
nice
size
so
will
not
lose
this
is
3rd
pair
have
bought
and
think
it
will
be
last
these
earbuds
synced
right
out
of
the
box
and
were
very
easy
to
pair
to
my
device
the
sound
quality
is
very
good
and
found
these
to
be
superior
to
the
beats
buds
that
had
prior
and
the
price
was
fraction
of
what
paid
before
very
sleek
design
and
sound
awesome
was
skeptical
at
first
as
have
always
had
the
wireless
bluetooth
that
sat
in
ear
lately
they
have
become
uncomfortable
always
pushing
them
back
in
while
running
to
make
sure
they
didn't
fall
out
decided
to
give
these
try
based
on
such
awesome
reviews
so
glad
did
love
the
design
and
they
look
awesome
on
haven't
tested
the
battery
charge
life
yet
but
the
charging
unit
looks
pretty
legit
and
don't
think
i'll
have
problem
with
it
am
very
happy
with
this
purchase
my
first
pair
had
trouble
charging
but
still
worked
contactes
support
and
they
took
care
of
me
the
sound
is
great,
they
are
sturdy
as
put
them
in
purse
and
pocket
and
no
issues
great
price
too
would
buy
again
have
small
ear
canals
and
most
earbuds
tend
to
fall
out
like
these
earbuds
because
they
fit
snugly
in
my
ears
and
have
loop
that
goes
over
my
ear
to
insure
the
buds
will
not
fall
off
and
get
lost
quite
pleased
with
my
purchase
have
been
using
these
sport
earbuds
for
weeks
and
really
like
them
so
fari
rarely
have
an
issue
with
connection
it
is
pretty
stable
another
pro
is
long
battery
life,
other
brands
usually
have
hrs
or
less
but
this
one
lasts
longer
than
that
used
it
for
more
than
hrs
straight
it
was
still
ok,
no
warning
yetonly
disadvantage
is
the
noise
cancellationi
don
think
that
this
product
has
the
noise
cancellation
featureother
than
that,
think
it
is
worth
every
penny
wow,
for
$40,
these
earbuds
are
pretty
good
the
sound
quality
is
pretty
clear,
and
with
the
little
wings
on
the
back
of
the
earbud,
don
have
to
worry
about
it
falling
out
and
losing
it
the
battery
life
is
also
really
long,
and
they
charge
really
quickly
so
far
pretty
cool
battery
seemed
to
last
long
time
just
opened
it
was
christmas
present
and
has
been
under
the
tree
over
week
and
still
was
charged
when
opened
haven
had
chance
to
check
out
the
sound
or
anything
yet
***
update
my
husband
is
loving
the
sound
and
how
he
can
use
and
when
bat
gets
low
he
can
use
the
other
separately
and
the
sound
quality
is
great
on
both
sides
can
hear
him
and
he
can
hear
me
clearly
pros:
sound
quality,
connect
automatically
to
phone
bluetooth,
loop
to
wrap
around
ear;
long
battery
life;
auto
recharge
when
stored
in
case;
digital
screen
shows
battery
life
remaining;
storage
casecon:
not
100%
noise
cancelling
these
headphones
are
really
good
value
they
paired
easily
via
bluetooth
without
any
issues
they
are
comfortable
to
wear
even
after
several
hours
used
these
for
an
extended
session
on
the
golf
driving
range
and
they
stayed
in
place
and
didn't
fall
out
also
used
them
on
both
the
treadmill
and
elliptical
machine
while
working
out
and
also
no
issues
with
them
staying
in
place
plus,
they
have
an
incredible
battery
life
for
the
price
these
headphones
are
really
good
value
wonderful
wireless
headphones
for
the
price
they
look
very
nice
and
are
easy
to
use
they
also
came
will
scratch
off
for
free
gift
what
fun
surprise
personally
like
little
more
bass
but
the
sound
quality
is
great
and
they
are
noise
cancelling
as
well
great
headphones
for
the
gym
no
problems
falling
out
of
ear*update*
over
the
last
few
days
the
bass
quality
has
become
lot
better
my
husband
is
so
happy
with
these
ear
buds
got
him
for
christmas
he
keeps
bragging
about
how
long
the
battery
lasts
cause
mine
kind
of
suck
and
hr
thinks
he's
funny
guess
i'll
be
ordering
pair
of
these
for
myself
next
use
it
for
work
and
love
it
cause
only
use
ear
at
time
and
when
its
low
battery
can
put
it
on
the
charger
and
switch
it
with
the
other
ear
bud
think
that
is
so
awesome
so
iam
never
with
out
my
music
this
is
my
first
pair
of
comfortable
bluetooth
earphones,
and
am
never
going
back
love
how
have
options
free
hands,
listening
in
one
ear,
charging
the
other
simultaneously,
and
pairing
to
variety
of
devices
no
only
that,
but
these
earphones
fit
better
than
any
other
wired
or
wireless
earbuds
i've
ever
tried
that's
over
the
course
of
at
least
yearsgreat
quality,
wonderful
experience
don't
typically
write
reviews,
but
these
earbuds
are
definitely
worth
their
price
i'm
very
happy
went
with
this,
it
fits
in
ny
ear
and
can
multitask
alot
better
vs
old
school
wires
trying
to
untangle
them
and
airports
falling
out
my
ear
love
the
secure
feeling
that
it
wraps
around
my
ear
so
excited
for
my
new
earphones
bought
these
as
back
up
for
me
and
my
husband
when
our
battery
died
the
quality
is
really
great
compared
to
my
old
earbuds
love
that
you
can
use
both
ears
as
the
main
one/control
too
super
excited
about
the
new
headphones
work
in
an
office
where
everyone
tends
to
have
some
sort
of
headphones
prefer
to
leave
one
ear
open
to
notice
important
conversations
or
just
friendliness/respect
these
are
perfect,
not
only
can
you
use
one
at
time
instead
of
both,
but
you
can
swap
them
out
to
charge
so
many
great
features
super
excited
to
continue
using
these
and
all
the
great
features
great
sound
quality
for
movies
and
music,
especially
when
you
use
both
earbuds
together
the
fit
is
very
good
and
stays
in
place
during
physical
activity
as
was
watching
movie
was
amazed
at
the
sounds
they
pick
up,
down
to
the
most
minute
and
unique
background
sounds
i'm
very
happy
with
all
aspects
of
these
earbuds
and
at
terrific
price
highly
recommend
them
headphone
case's
battery
discharges
too
quickly,
and
can
only
be
charged
with
certain
usbc
chargers
tested
around
46
around
the
house
only
one
worked
while
it's
not
the
perfect
headphone,
it's
certainly
worth
th
asking
price
of
about
35$
so
the
only
issue
have
with
these
are
if
you
lose
the
carrying
case
they
come
in
which
is
also
the
batter
charger
you
can
charge
them
anymore
understand
the
concept
of
them
charging
in
it,
but
wish
one
ear
bud
could
also
charged
without
the
case
other
then
that
they
are
good
would
buy
these
again
they
were
easy
to
pair
with
my
amazon
tablet
and
the
sound
is
great
battery
life
is
rally
good
used
them
for
hours
and
still
have
98%
these
are
easy
to
charge
and
work
great
like
these
over
all
they
range
is
little
short
have
625
square
foot
apartment
and
they
don't
quite
reach
from
one
end
to
the
other
it
reconnects
fast
it
seems
like
each
head
phone
is
its
own
entity
which
is
good
fits
easily
and
securely
over
ear
which
wanted;
tried
various
ear
buds
and
always
have
trouble
keeping
in
ear
don
have
to
worry
about
losing
one
when
walking
or
exercising
sound
quality
is
acceptable
and
they
do
cancel
out
lot
of
outside
noise
charges
quickly
product
is
as
described
gotta
say
was
skeptical
at
first
for
the
price
but
these
headphones
get
the
job
done
honestly
didn't
find
fault
in
the
noise
cancelation
so
the
overall
sound
quality
was
pretty
good
and
had
some
decent
bass
to
them
as
well
use
them
on
my
long
workouts
and
they
lasted
good
days
with
the
case
before
the
first
charge,
plus
really
like
the
power/battery
meter
and
the
build
quality
is
actually
pretty
decent
for
the
cost
im
satisfied
with
them
and
if
it
came
down
to
it
i'd
definitely
get
another
pair
this
was
great
impulse
buy
it
took
couple
of
try
for
bluetooth
to
synch
to
my
iphone
sounds
great,
the
charging
storage
is
compact
and
innovative
unfortunately
the
lid
easily
broke
from
the
hinge
these
are
amazing
pairs
quickly
and
sounds
great,
the
controls
are
easy
to
use,
and
most
importantly
they
stay
in
place
comfortably
for
hours
love
the
idea
that
both
ears
can
be
used
alone
or
together
honestly
can't
find
any
fault
with
this
earphone
it's
one
of
the
best
i've
had
in
ages
feels
so
comfortable
almost
like
there's
nothing
on
my
ears
the
paert
that
goes
over
the
ears
is
super
soft
and
stretchy
so
it
doesnt
feel
like
youre
forcing
anything
to
fit
your
ear
in
there
are
different
size
tips
to
ensure
every
user
can
get
the
size
tips
that
will
make
it
suitable
for
their
ears
trust
me
am
amazed
that
it
was
true
to
the
description
used
mine
everywhere
the
battery
life
is
super
amazing
the
comfort
is
awesome
would
order
again
not
to
mention
the
price
playing
music
and
battery
life
is
great
but
when
it
comes
to
the
phone
callbetter
switch
back
to
hand
held
so
the
person
you
are
talking
to
can
hear
you
you
can
hear
the
person
excellent
but
your
caller
will
barely
or
hardly
hear
you
cause
of
muffling/wind
soundthat's
even
indoors
or
no
wind
around
this
is
why
give
it
star
rating
like
that
the
case
displays
the
remaining
battery
life
also,
paired
easily
with
my
phone
feels
secure
on
my
ears,
and
comfortable
to
wear;
glad
other
sizes
of
ear
pieces
were
included
so
could
get
the
right
fit
after
recently
losing
my
air
pods
have
purchased
different
types
of
wireless
earbuds
and
they
just
don't
compare
3rd
times
charm
in
this
case
because
this
brand
has
great
sound
when
listening
to
music
have
not
tried
to
use
with
laptop
but
look
forward
to
testing
them
out
in
my
next
meeting
these
are
the
best
wireless
ear
buds
that
have
great
sound
and
bass
plus
making
calls
never
have
to
worry
about
falling
out
of
ear
with
the
over
the
ear
hooks
to
hold
them
in
place
plus
the
ctype
cord
and
charging
display
show
the
percentage
that
is
left
these
earbuds
are
awesome
like
how
they
stay
in
my
ear
always
have
problems
with
the
little
earbuds
falling
out
but
because
these
wrapper
on
your
ear
they
stay
in
the
sound
is
awesome
great
value
great
quality
you
ll
be
very
pleased
with
them
haven
gotten
to
fully
test
the
battery
life
as
just
got
them
yesterday
and
the
charging
case
is
doing
it
job,
but
the
sound
quality
is
good
and
the
noise
cancellation
works
enough
that
can
hear
myself
singing
along
haha
great
pair
of
wireless
headphones
and
the
price
was
perfect
just
wanted
something
could
use
at
work
very
good
sound
very
good
noise
cancellation
very
easy
to
use
overall
very
pleased
with
this
product
easy
controls,
comfortable
fit
minimalist
design
even
though
product
may
appear
too
large
battery
life
can
be
extended
while
playing
music
at
1/4
volume,
great
while
wearing
glasses
and
sunglasses
the
only
thumbs
down
will
give
this
product
is
the
ability
to
recharge
individual
earbuds
at
least
twice
fully
to
get
you
through
your
day
without
recharging
case
that's
on
personal
life
experience
on
which
my
days
are
average
at
1416
hours
over
all
is
something
that
is
not
deal
breaker
for
me
came
fast
and
well
packed
sounds
pretty
good,
very
comfortable,
it's
just
the
right
size,
fits
perfectly
and
doesn't
fall
off
you
can
easily
do
gymnastics
with
this
earbuds
easy
connection
with
bluetooth,
and
easy
to
manage
it
is
sweatproof,
but
not
completely
waterproof,
so
beware
battery
life
think
it's
normal,
hours
plus
you
can
recharge
them
couple
of
times
with
the
case
also,
case
feels
little
heavy,
but
nothing
bothersome
noise
cancellation
it's
not
perfect,
but
pretty
close
to
complete
noise
cancellation
for
me
this
are
perfect,
i'm
loving
it
these
earbuds
work
well
after
couple
of
months
we
had
problem
getting
good
bluetooth
connection
notified
acclaim
and
they
replied
with
some
suggestion
and
ultimately
replaced
with
new
set
of
earbuds
these
work
with
my
phone
fine
however
bought
them
for
my
computer
for
online
teaching
can't
get
the
volume
to
respond
on
the
computer
or
the
headphone
buttons
the
mic
barely
pics
up
my
voice
came
ready
to
use
really
good
sound,
easy
to
use
buttons
and
they
stay
put
yes
you
can
use
them
individually
have
not
tried
them
making
call
yet
noise
canceling
was
not
something
high
priority
to
me;
this
is
medium
you
can
hear
some
of
whats
going
on
around
you;
which
want
they're
some
nice
headphones
and
plus
they
tell
how
much
charged
they
are
and
the
percentage
of
the
battery
for
the
case
is
which
is
great
so
you'll
know
when
to
charge
it
instead
of
waiting
to
see
if
it's
gonna
cut
off
in
the
middle
of
charging
to
know
it
needs
charging
for
the
price
i'd
recommend
it
they
hold
their
charge
and
fit
nicely
wish
the
bass
was
little
better,
but
the
exposed
buttons
more
than
make
up
for
that
shortfall
definitely
great
value
recommend
for
workout/runtypes
have
small
ear
canals
the
wrap
around
ear
holders
work
very
well
for
me
one
of
the
few
solutions
that
have
in
the
area
of
earbuds
the
sound
quality
is
good
and
clear
they
are
good
value
these
work
great,
the
volume
is
loud,
and
they
don't
fall
off
my
ears
while
i'm
working
they
are
inexpensive,
but
don't
feel
cheap,
and
can
use
them
all
week
at
work
without
having
to
recharge
the
battery
these
suck
the
life
of
these
suck
if
you
sweat
just
little
they
stop
working
have
had
pair
bought
1st
pair
the
right
one
didnt
work
they
sent
replacement
that
right
one
didn't
work
then
the
company
sent
me
free
pair
and
the
right
one
once
again
stopped
working
they
need
to
put
more
work
on
the
right
ear
piece
there
are
great
i've
only
had
them
for
couple
days
but
i've
been
using
them
constantly
while
cleaning
and
doing
things
around
the
house
love
that
you
have
the
option
to
only
wear
one
at
time
so
can
keep
an
ear
out
for
my
two
little
ones
they
connect
pretty
much
automatically
to
my
phone
once
i've
taken
them
out
of
the
case
the
battery
life
it
great
too
i've
worn
one
or
the
other
all
day
without
any
problems
with
the
battery
running
low
they
are
super
comfortable
and
secure
on
my
ears
needed
something
with
amazing
battery
for
work
the
pair
was
using
died
in
less
than
hours
from
full
charge
i've
used
these
t17
for
over
hours
of
pc
videos
and
they
were
still
going
the
feel
is
decent
and
the
volume
is
perfect
love
the
case,
just
be
carefuly,
the
hinge
on
the
case
can
be
weak
but
it
doesn't
effect
the
charging
and
clips
right
back
in,
may
not
stay
perfectly
but
that
is
the
only
downside
have
found
and
trust
me
i've
been
looking
as
do
with
all
products
to
review
them
these
headset
are
so
amazing
for
me
it
hard
to
get
headphone
that
can
stay
in
my
ears
so
these
go
over
your
ear
so
it
great
had
over
month
and
just
charged
them
second
time
used
them
at
work
mostly
so
not
lot
of
use
but
they
are
awesome
for
the
price
can
beat
quality
is
great
case
is
bulk
big
but
it
ok
for
me
love
them
these
are
great
work
really
well
last
for
long
time
use
them
every
day
for
work
and
they
are
comfortable
and
don
hurt
the
ears
when
they
are
in
for
long
time
the
only
small
thing
is
the
case
lid
isn
held
on
that
great
the
charging
part
works
great
but
dropped
the
case
the
first
day
had
it
and
the
lid
popped
off
it
still
clips
in
but
have
to
be
gentle
with
it
other
than
that
small
thing
love
them
also
you
don
need
the
lid
to
charge
so
that
good
when
answering
the
phone
everyone
can
hear
me
great
too
great
for
my
morning
runs,
allows
just
enough
ambiant
noise
to
allow
for
cars
etc
perfect
light
weight
and
great
fit
my
podcasts
sound
better
than
ever
love
the
one
ear
option
for
when
go
with
my
daughter
we
can
laugh
at
the
same
stories
love
these
headphones
they
are
great
value
love
the
charging
case
and
that
you
know
how
much
battery
life
is
remaining
the
sound
quality
is
excellent
the
cons
are
that
wish
they
had
range
longer
than
33
ft,
incoming
phone
calls
would
actually
say
the
phone
number
so
that
don
have
to
look
at
my
phone
to
see
who
calling,
and
don
think
the
song
playback
button
works
none
of
those
are
dealbreakers,
though,
so
will
keep
them
first
time
trying
them
on
right
out
of
the
box
and
impressed
having
them
on
for
the
first
time
quite
impressed
sounds
great
and
easily
connected
to
my
iphone
xrupdate:
went
to
the
gym
today
and
these
sounded
really
good
with
the
right
amount
of
bass
it
stayed
firmly
on
my
ears
as
was
running
on
the
treadmill
buena
calidad
de
sonido,
me
siento
segura
de
que
no
se
me
van
caer
aparte
te
mandan
un
rascale
como
regalo
se
te
ganas
otro
par
igual
pero
desepcion
esto
me
llego
these
are
okay,
great
for
the
price
have
actual
power
beats
and
these
are
little
less
quality
as
far
as
the
actual
headphone
material
and
the
sound
isnt
even
close
but
great
for
the
price
find
the
sound
quality
to
be
really
grating
at
anything
more
than
half
volume
in
comparison,
think
the
sound
quality
of
apple's
older
wire
earbuds
are
much
betterthe
earbuds
cut
off
from
the
device
or
disconnect
from
each
other
creating
an
echoed
delay
during
usage
sometimes
also,
you
cannot
connect
the
earbuds
to
more
than
one
device
at
time
unlike
others
works
as
expectededit:
battery
in
case
began
to
discharge
and
make
high
pitch
soundheadphones
had
high
sound
quality,
good
fit
and
felt
like
solid
build
very
nice
headphones
especially
for
the
price
easy
to
work,
speakers
and
mic
very
clear
and
noise
free
when
connected
just
started
using
it
and
battery
life
thus
far
has
been
great
will
update
review
as
go
along
purchased
these
wireless
earbuds
to
run
the
look
and
qualify
of
the
earbuds
and
case
are
fantastic
and
exceeded
my
expectations
the
maximum
volume
is
much
lower
than
every
other
headset
or
earbud
have
used
when
running
on
busy
road,
it
is
very
difficult
to
impossible
to
listen
to
podcasts
or
audio
books
as
sections
get
missed
overall,
would
not
recommend
these
due
to
the
volume
limitations
especially
if
planning
to
use
anywhere
outside
of
quiet
home
these
are
so
easy
to
set
up
and
use
very
comfortable
and
they
don
fall
off
great
sound
quality
for
all
uses
love
them
for
music,
podcasts,
and
talking
on
the
phone
even
in
the
car
i've
used
few
different
brands
of
headphones,
and
these
are
really
good
like
that
they
come
with
different
size
ear
tips,
because
my
ear
canals
are
different
size
the
charge
indicator
in
the
case
is
also
great
feature
awesome
ear
buds
that
fit
my
little
ears
perfectly
and
stay
put
great
sound,
too
voice
on
calls
is
clear
and
crisp
and
answering
call
isn
difficult
thing
to
figure
out
love
these
purchased
these
headphones
as
christmas
gift
for
my
husband,
he
loves
them
they
are
his
first
nice
pair
of
headphones,
he
says
the
sound
quality
is
great
and
he
really
likes
the
quality
of
the
noise
cancelling
feature
as
well
these
are
great
pair
of
earbuds
have
waited
years
as
the
hype
of
bluetooth
earbuds
came
and
went
was
satisfied
with
my
year
old
corded
earbuds
until
finally
had
enough
these
were
the
earbuds
settled
on
and
it
was
great
choice
the
bass
is
quite
good
and
the
sound
cancelling
is
actually
pretty
good
too
they
also
stay
connected
to
my
laptop
as
walk
around
the
house
not
100%
of
the
time
but
usually
get
really
good
range
overall
the
sound
quality
is
good
for
the
price
overall
10/10
would
recommend
for
the
price
paid
for
this
bluetooth
earpiece
it
has
been
great
sound
quality
is
amazing
nd
noise
cancellation
is
good
also,
stay
long
on
the
phone
so
my
battery
tends
to
die
faster
but
so
far
its
been
great
for
me
like
it,
have
bought
different
pair
before
these,
and
really
enjoy
the
fit
better
and
do
not
hurt
my
ears
the
quality
of
the
calls
is
excellent,
and
the
music
fantastici
sue
these
while
working
out
and
audiobooks
for
schooli
like
the
digital
indicator
on
how
much
battery
life
is
as
well
have
had
number
of
bluetooth
headphonesi
wanted
new
set
of
headphones
for
working
out,
that
would
stay
in
my
ear
and
provide
good
sound
and
battery
lifethe
battery
life
is
~5
hrs
which
is
sufficient
for
working
out
the
sound
quality
is
fine
the
bass
isnt
booming,
but
they
are
good
for
the
pricethe
charging
case
charges
the
headphones
and
can
get
~4
charges
before
needing
to
recharge
the
caseoverall,
am
satisfied
with
these
headphones
purchased
these
headphones
because
of
the
advertised
battery
life
and
so
far
they
are
working
great
especially
love
the
charging
case
it
comes
with
which
is
so
convenient
to
use
on
the
go
or
when
traveling
and
like
the
led
display
that
tells
you
how
charged
it
is
it
connects
to
my
phone
without
any
issues
and
tells
me
when
it
is
connected
through
the
headphones
love
using
them
while
exercising
or
doing
chores
around
the
house
couldn
be
any
easier
to
charge
my
apple
watch
take
it
from
the
box
and
plug
one
in
to
usb,
and
the
other
end
is
the
magnetic
disc
that
clings
to
the
back
of
the
watch
love
it
when
found
my
previous
headphones
bose
at
the
bottom
of
the
washing
machine
was
so
upset
but
it
turned
out
to
be
happy
accident
the
sound
quality
of
my
new
occiam
is
awesome,
they
fit
great
and
never
fall
off
my
ear,
unlike
my
previous
ones
one
of
the
best
features
is
that
you
can
hear
out
of
both
earpieces
when
on
phone
call
these
things
were
worthless
had
the
first
pair
replaced
after
days
because
when
talk
on
phone
the
person
could
not
hear
me
,
so
request
an
replacement
received
the
nd
pair
and
they
wouldn't
connect
to
my
phone
so
far
so
good
sound
is
great,
volume
adjustable,
comfy
and
safe
over
ear
sound
control
perfect
keeps
charge
long
time
makes
me
happy
ll
keep
watch
for
continued
success
so
comfortable
have
small
ears
and
buds
do
not
fit,
require
them
to
have
the
over
ear
security
great
sounds,
easy
to
replace
in
the
charging
case
compact
and
safe
for
travel
this
product
was
lot
better
than
expected
for
the
price
the
sound
quality
is
very
good
and
fit
is
comfortable
no
wire
going
between
the
two
and
can
be
active
without
it
feeling
like
it
is
going
to
fall
off
my
ears
the
battery
seems
to
last
long
time
was
gifted
these
headphones
to
use
while
working
they
are
very
practical,
and
have
tremendous
battery
life
with
clear
sound
quality
the
earphones
can
be
used
independent
from
each
other
which
is
fantastic
benefit
since
often
use
them
in
situations
where
need
to
be
able
to
still
be
aware
of
my
surroundingsthey
aren't
perfect,
but
for
the
price
it
is
definitely
5star
buy
got
these
for
my
mom
who
isn
technically
savvy,
but
she
caught
on
to
how
to
use
them
and
really
is
enjoying
them
they
are
comfortable
to
wear
and
the
sound
quality
is
great
she
can
walk
all
around
her
house
away
from
her
phone
and
not
be
disconnected
from
the
bluetooth
comfortable
most
comfortable
pair
have
ever
had
gave
set
and
gave
as
gift
they
loved
them
too
ordered
another
pair
for
my
son
because
like
them
so
well
and
he
loves
them
too
these
sync
really
easily
and
have
low
profile
light
on
my
ears
and
they
don't
hurt
can
sleep
with
them
on
great
for
walking,
running,
comfortable
longtime
wearing,
and
wear
them
while
cleaning
have
only
had
them
couple
days
they
are
incredibly
comfortable
and
the
batteries
lasted
more
than
nine
hours
of
continuous
use,
listening
to
music
and
receiving
phone
calls
have
tried
many
wireless
ear
buds
and
either
returned
them
or
gave
them
to
my
husband
because
couldn
keep
them
in
my
ears
so
far,
these
ear
buds
have
been
the
best
ve
tried
did
workout
in
them
and
stayed
in
without
any
wiggling,
plus
they
were
comfortable
the
sound
is
decent,
the
case
has
an
easy
battery
life
readout,
and
they
paired
quickly
and
with
no
problems
ve
only
had
these
about
week,
but
so
far,
happy
with
them
quit
working
after
months
great
price
excellent
sound
quality
this
is
actually
my
first
blue
tooth
item
and
i'm
very
pleased
did
some
price
comparisons
before
purchasing
and
these
are
amazingly
priced
compared
to
electronic
stores
great
quality
and
sturdy
the
back
of
the
ear
piece
is
soft
rubber
you
don't
even
feel
it
i'll
definitely
gift
these
as
well
really
liked
this
product
it
has
good
battery
life
haven
had
to
charge
them
yet
and
ve
been
using
them
for
days
and
it
also
had
good
sound
quality
it
fairly
easy
to
connect
one
earbud
and
often
only
use
one
at
time
however,
the
downside
is
haven
figured
out
how
to
connect
both
the
same
time
without
really
focusing
other
than
that
these
are
great
deal
for
the
price
these
bluetooth
headphones
are
exactly
what
have
been
looking
for
they
are
lightweight,
great
sound
quality
and
very
comfortable
after
putting
them
in,
literally
forgot
they
were
there
even
with
phone
calls,
it
feels
like
have
all
the
privacy
need
because
of
the
noise
canceling
feature
get
about
20ft
distance
from
my
phone
to
the
headphones
for
the
price
these
are
awesome
these
sound
great
and
stay
put
really
good
for
working
out
great
to
have
freedom
of
movement
without
cords,
bulky
weight,
or
worrying
about
them
falling
out
when
on
the
exercise
bike,
can
hear
my
child
talking
at
me
at
all
sorry
can
hear
you
go
ask
mama
best
headphones
i've
owned
in
this
price
range
they
don't
get
quite
the
depth
of
sound
as
others
i've
used
but
these
are
fraction
of
the
price
very
good
battery
life
so
far
and
good
range
they
are
also
pretty
comfortable
compared
to
other
wrap
around
earbuds
only
minor
issue
i've
had
so
far
is
the
connection
seems
to
cut
out
for
half
second
once
and
while
but
not
big
deal
for
me
solid
choice
if
your
looking
for
some
everyday
headphones
that
won't
hurt
your
pockets
too
much
am
surprised
with
the
battery
life
it
has
since
for
me
that
is
very
important
very
easy
to
connect
with
my
phone
laptop
and
practically
easy
to
carry
around
in
my
handbag
can
use
one
in
one
ear
for
many
hours
until
the
battery
is
low
then,
put
it
in
the
box
to
recharge
and
put
the
other
in
my
ear,
and
it
is
already
connected
works
great
just
received
these
and
they
are
great
always
have
problems
with
headphones
falling
out
these
wrap
comfortably
around
my
ear
and
don't
budge
the
sound
is
great
you
also
have
the
option
of
using
just
one
or
both
at
the
same
time
the
design,
the
comfort
are
very
good,
fast
charge,
the
charge
indicator
is
must
so
you
know
when
to
recharge
the
headphones,
also
you
can
use
only
one
and
that
is
plus
my
main
interest
was
being
able
to
use
headphones
for
several
hours
at
time
while
doing
daytoday
activities
used
to
have
collar
headphones
but
you
pull
them
and
hit
anywhere
love
that
these
western
headphones
can
be
used
in
mono
or
stereo
mode
so
they
don't
make
it
uncomfortable
when
working
or
talking
to
people
in
my
family
they
are
very
comfortable
in
my
ears
not
only
was
the
charging
case
dead
on
arrival,
but
when
tested
out
the
ear
buds
the
volume
button
only
allowed
me
to
turn
down
the
volume
couldn't
turn
it
back
up
on
either
ear
bud
lame
so
far
happy
with
sound
quality
and
battery
life
only
charged
it
once
since
received
them
last
week
comfortable
in
my
ears,
and
blocks
outside
noise
only
issue
may
be
that
those
on
other
end
may
hear
your
background
had
to
roll
windows
up
and
turn
my
radio
off
but,
other
than
thatso
far
so
good
bought
this
headset
due
to
the
hook
onto
your
ears
in
stead
of
the
strictly
inear
ones
decent
sound
quality
and
battery
life
for
the
price
only
thing
is
that
had
another
pair
where
the
charging
case
can
be
used
as
mobie
charger
for
other
devices
as
well
ie
phone
where
this
one
doesn't
these
earbud
are
exactly
what
was
looking
for
to
use
with
my
android
phone
they
fit
over
your
ear
and
are
very
comfortable
had
bought
several
pairs
before
these
that
were
too
big
or
could
not
get
them
to
set
up
with
my
phone
these
fit
great,connected
to
my
phone
easily,
and
the
battery
life
is
unreal
they
sound
great
and
everyone
hears
me
well
am
very
impressed
by
these
ear
buds
the
battery
life
is
great
the
sound
quality
is
great
and
have
not
had
any
issues
with
them
disconnecting
even
like
that
carrying
case
that
doubles
as
the
charging
kit
really
liked
these
when
first
got
them
they
are
comfortable
and
the
sound
is
pretty
good
the
issue
have
is
that
they
cut
in
and
out
often
one
earbud
or
the
other
will
stop
for
bit
and
then
come
back
on
the
other
similar
issue
is
that
they
power
off
randomly
while
running
the
other
day
my
right
earbud
kept
cycling
between
power
on
and
off,
really
disrupting
the
experience
maybe
it's
just
my
pair
but
they
just
don't
work
to
my
expectations
don't
really
know
much
about
headphones,
usually
buy
the
$7
ones
but
keep
dropping
my
phone
and
my
head
phones
get
ripped
painfully
out
of
my
ears
bluetooth
stops
that
and
these
are
great
for
sharing
the
office
with
my
teacher
husband
during
pandemic
times
at
first
was
skeptical
of
getting
these
ear
buds
because
they
were
so
cheap
but
after
using
them
for
several
days
they
were
the
best
purchase
to
make
the
sound
is
great
its
not
beats
but
its
30
dollars
what
can
you
expect
the
most
important
thing
to
me
is
the
functionality
of
the
product
and
they
function
exceptionally
well
was
nervous
if
they
would
stay
in
my
ears
and
after
working
out
with
them
for
several
days
they
haven't
fallen
out
and
the
battery
life
is
excellent
love
these
they
are
comfortable
to
wear
all
day
and
the
battery
lasts
all
day
great
sound
and
easy
to
use
have
convinced
of
my
coworkers
to
also
purchase
them
at
first
could
not
figure
how
to
pair
them
with
my
tv
which
is
the
whole
reason
wanted
them
but
my
husband
figured
it
out
and
now
they
are
awesome
they
are
so
comfortable
can
sleep
with
them
and
they
are
completely
noise
cancelling
the
battery
life
is
awesome
am
really
pleased
with
ear
buds
and
for
the
price
fabulous
deal
recommend
them
for
everybody
sound
is
very
low
battery
life
is
horrible
came
mostly
charged
connected
to
my
phone
and
laptop
pretty
easily
sound
is
pretty
good
have
only
been
using
them
for
little
while
so
far,
so
will
try
to
remember
to
update
on
battery
life
later
on
these
are
pretty
good
earbuds
especially
for
the
price
they
stay
in
your
ears
which
is
struggle
for
most
of
my
earbuds
they
also
block
out
sound
pretty
well
as
work
in
loud
environment
the
only
fault
is
the
charging
case
is
not
as
great
battery
these
are
great
for
an
inexpensive
pair
of
earbuds
they
are
lightweight
and
easy
to
use
they
also
fit
on
your
ears
firmly
because
they
hook
over
the
back
of
your
ears
was
looking
for
comfortable,
over
the
ear
fit
and
mic
for
phone
calls;
noise
cancellation
was
not
important
to
me,
because
actually
often
need
to
be
aware
of
outside
noise
these
are
incredible
comfortable
and
stable,
with
long
battery
life
the
clarity
for
phone
calls
is
great
these
are
exactly
what
wanted
and
needed,
and
the
case
is
super
secure
and
easy
to
carry
thought
i'd
have
to
pay
twice
the
price
for
these
what
find
thanks,
occiam
these
fit
my
ears
without
falling
out
the
sound
quality
is
fantastic
great
battery
life,
going
on
days
without
recharging
no
background
noise
highly
recommend
very
good
sound
quality
while
paired
to
my
iphone
and
watch
comfortable
even
with
ear
covers
for
winter
use
long
battery
life
and
comfortable
to
using
it
in
my
ears
love
the
sound,
but
the
case
is
hit
or
miss
if
it
charges
just
got
them
last
week
they
have
great
sound
and
are
easy
to
use
best
of
all,
for
me,
is
that
the
design
helps
them
stay
in
my
ears
much
better
than
others
have
had
replaced
another
set
of
bluetooth
headphones
because
the
volume
was
too
low,
and
there
was
no
volume
control
the
occiam
bluetooth
headphones
hhave
great
sound
quality
and
solid
volume
when
thought
lost
my
airpods
decided
to
come
on
amazon
again
never
fails
listen
to
the
reviews
these
are
dope,
fit
great,
feel
great,
are
lot
more
stable
in
your
ear
compared
to
airpods,
volume
is
awesome
can
hear
anything
other
than
this
banging
music
happy
bought
this
as
gift
for
my
hubby
should
have
gotten
one
for
myself
clear
directions,
easy
to
pair/set
up
comes
with
ear
tip
sizes
very
comfortable
and
secure
to
wear
w/o
fear
of
falling
out
while
exercising
luv
the
charging
case
stores
the
buds
while
not
in
use
and
keeps
fully
charged
for
next
use
my
husband
said
sound
quality
is
great
uses
both
buds
but
likes
having
the
option
of
only
wearing
one
definitely
would
recommend
very
happy
with
the
purchase
these
are
my
year
old's
favorite
pair
for
virtual
learning
and
zoom
calls
they
don't
hurt
his
years
and
they
stay
on
when
they
do
jumping
jacks/dancing
in
class
have
always
used
the
speaker
on
my
iphone
with
many
complaints
from
my
family
finally
purchased
these
wireless
headphones
my
family
is
happy
since
they
can
now
hear
me
better
can
not
compare
these
headphones
to
others
but
for
someone
whom
was
not
inclined
to
use
headphones
in
the
past,
am
happy
to
say
that
will
use
these
all
the
time
have
not
found
dislike
to
date
cannot
use
standard,
just
stick
in
your
ear,
earbuds,
as
my
ear
orifice
will
not
hold
them
in
place
have
found
these
clipping
over
the
ear
to
be
highly
effective
and
the
sound
quality
is
excellent
fits
well
and
comfortable
good
sound
quality
other
earbuds
fit
well
for
small
child
sized
ears
other
earbuds
would
not
fit,
fell
out
of
ears
and
were
not
comfortable
these
fit
snug
and
allow
to
be
worn
while
active
first
of
all,
they
sound
great
the
around
the
ear
piece
is
very
flexible
to
customize
the
fit
and
finally,
the
controls
are
very
simple
to
operate
and
work
easily
customer
service
was
excellent
they
responded
within
day
and
were
very
accommodating
and
polite
the
ear
buds
have
excellent
noise
cancelation
they
go
around
the
ears
nicely
and
they
come
with
cute
easy
to
transport
case
the
best
thing
about
them
is
that
you
can
use
each
headphone
on
different
devices
they
each
serve
as
their
own
controller
very
pleased
with
the
customer
service
and
with
the
product
received
my
headset
really
quickly
was
bit
sketchy
about
purchasing
brand
wasn't
familiar
with
but
i'm
glad
took
the
chance
the
headset
fits
perfectly
which
is
big
deal
for
me
since
have
small
ears
and
can
never
find
good
fit
the
battery
life
is
amazing
and
it
works
perfectly
well
once
have
my
headset
in
everything
else
around
is
almost
none
existent
it's
definitely
stars
for
me
worked
so
well
bought
another
as
gift
the
sound
is
good
but
the
batteries
in
the
headphone
and
charging
case
die
after
day,
even
when
you
re
not
using
it
got
them
to
replace
another
pair
that
lasted
for
days
when
they
weren
in
use
will
be
buying
another
pair
because
this
pair
does
not
have
reliable
battery
life
the
headphone
is
good
in
regards
to
quality
and
operation
when
first
had
them
the
sound
quality
was
good
only
issue
at
this
moment
sometimes
the
person
on
the
other
line
said
they
get
feedback
not
quite
certain
if
that
happens
when
the
battery
life
is
low
but
will
continue
using
and
would
give
an
updated
feedback
later
very
pleased
with
the
comfort
and
quality
of
these
ear
buds
the
product
arrived
with
broken
case
and
emailed
the
company
as
per
inclosed
warranty
info
they
contacted
me
promptly
and
offered
to
make
it
right
great
customer
service
these
headphones
are
incredible
the
bass
tone
is
just
off
the
chain
forizzle
seriously
qont
be
disappointed
buying
these
i'm
ordering
more
as
stocking
stuffers
bought
these
as
alternative
to
my
bose
ones
that
can
only
wear
at
home
the
sound
quality
is
great
and
almost
similar
to
my
bose
ones
the
batter
life
is
awesome
and
last
more
than
hours
the
design
of
the
container
box
is
great
by
having
digits
showing
batter
level
of
the
caseoverall,
am
very
happy
with
the
performance,
the
battery
life
and
of
course
the
price
would
recommend
my
friends
buying
these
am
going
to
buy
second
pair
of
these
real
soon
for
my
son
wonderful
audio
quality
with
the
addition
of
it
being
waterproof
&
fitting
nicely
in
my
ears
as
well
as
with
the
guard
also
appreciate
the
gift
&
warranty
got
these
because
my
old
one
broke
and
these
are
way
better
great
sound
and
very
comfortable
to
wear
tested
them
out
at
the
gym
and
have
no
complaints
would
definitely
recommend
i've
been
using
the
wireless
ear
phones
for
only
day
but
they're
great
really
like
no
wires
so
they
don't
get
tangled
sound
quality
is
also
really
good
these
will
not
stay
connected
to
my
devices
like
previous
buds
have
that
connect
automatically
every
time
these
lose
their
connection
and
have
to
be
re
paired
every
time
these
ear
buds
are
really
great
value
i've
tried
many
low
cost
wireless
buds
but
these
have
the
best
sound
combined
with
exceptional
battery
life
would
highly
recommend
them
if
you
don't
want
to
pay
for
name
brands
yeah
so
first
off
the
prize
scam
they
have
is
just
that
to
get
reviews
second
don't
try
and
have
hat,
glasses,
beanie
or
anything
around
your
ear
as
they
will
get
very
uncomfortable
and
sound
terrible
once
worn
more
than
few
times
they
don't
sit
in
the
charger
case
right
right
which
means
they
will
connect/disconnect
from
my
phone
all
day
long
even
when
not
using
them
compact
wireless
bluetooth
earphones,
when
going
out
you
also
can
easily
listen
to
music,
comparing
to
wired
headphones,
they
are
much
more
convenientin
particular,
the
headphones
are
very
comfortable
to
wear,
no
pressure
to
the
ears,
no
swelling
painthe
sound
is
good
and
clear,
there
is
no
noisethe
charging
case
can
be
charged
and
stored,
with
good
battery
life
it
can
be
used
for
hours
at
time,
which
is
quite
goodit's
really
nice
looking,
stylish
and
comfortable
to
touch
love
the
comfortable
fit,now
don't
feel
like
im
going
to
lose
one
everytime
wear
them
feel
safe
with
these
in
my
ear
for
sure
the
sound
quality
is
also
really
crisp
and
clear
and
pairs
instantly,
you
definitely
are
getting
more
for
your
money
with
these
earbuds
finally
the
search
is
over
ps
battery
life
is
fantastic
apparently
have
small
ears,
and
finding
earbuds
that
don
hurt
has
been
challenge
these
were
recommended
to
me,
and
so
glad
bought
them
in
my
picture
you
see
the
size
difference
of
the
piece
that
is
at/in
your
ear
these
ones
are
smaller,
so
they
don
hurt,
they
stay
put,
and
sound
great
these
are
great
sound
is
clear
and
there
no
cord
which
is
great
the
case
charges
the
ear
buds
so
they
are
always
ready
to
go
love
these
worth
every
penny
love
these
headphones
they
are
comfortable
and
the
battery
life
is
excellent
the
sound
is
good
for
the
price
was
really
surprised
at
how
good
they
were
one
of
the
best
sets
of
ear
buds
i've
ever
owned
live
that
way
they
fit
my
ears
normally
ear
buds
hurt
my
ears
after
wearing
them
for
while
but
these
don't
bother
me
at
all
the
sound
quality
is
also
great
could
hardly
hear
anything
going
on
around
me
with
the
music
playing
lol
like
the
fact
that
they
wrap
around
the
ear,
very
secure
also
the
display
in
the
case/recharger
makes
it
easyto
see
how
much
charge
is
left
on
the
ear
buds
and
charger,
my
old
earbuds
told
me
low,
medium
and
highi
also
like
that
the
volume
controls
are
on
the
ear
buds
and
are
real
switches,
had
set
that
used
touch
controland
was
hard
to
use
pairing
was
easy
and
it
reconnected
on
the
next
power
up
just
received
my
new
earbuds
yesterday
and
have
to
say
i'm
impressed,
the
sound
quality
is
very
smooth
and
love
the
display
on
the
charging
case
the
design
is
really
nice
and
i'm
super
glad
the
case
has
ctype
plug
in
for
charging
since
own
galaxy
device
overall
this
is
good
product
for
good
price
i've
also
had
chance
to
speak
with
customer
service
for
warranty
and
to
claim
reward
and
they
are
quick
to
respond
and
are
very
helpful
so
far
i've
only
been
able
to
use
them
couple
of
times
battery
life
is
great,
really
enjoy
being
able
to
only
use
one
headphone
at
time,
since
bought
them
for
work
sound
quality
is
great
considering
price
point,
they
are
buds
so
they
do
cancel
some
noise,
but
they
are
listed
as
noise
cancellation
product
overall
ive
super
satisfied
with
my
purchase
as
it
beats
having
to
spend
hundreds
on
some
name
brand
beats
or
air
pods
that
give
little
to
no
upgrade
in
quality
these
are
amazing
especially
for
the
price
unbelievable
quality
sound,
and
long
battery
life
the
charge
is
quick
and
gets
you
back
in
the
gym
in
no
time
especially
like
the
extra
ear
hole
covers,
since
need
the
smaller
ones
to
fit
my
ears
highly
recommend
this
product,
you
won't
be
disappointed
these
are
awesome
love
having
the
option
to
use
one
ear
bud
or
the
other
instead
of
both
at
the
same
time
sound
quality
is
great
and
battery
life
is
awesome
use
this
for
discord
while
chatting
with
friends
who
are
playing
on
pc
clarity
is
great
and
they
hear
me
just
fine
while
i'm
playing
on
my
playstation
these
earbuds
sound
really
good,
they
also
connect
to
one
another
as
they
should,
and
they
connect
to
all
my
devices
easily
it
is
also
worth
noting
that
the
mic
works
pretty
well
intended
for
these
to
be
backup
pair
of
headphones
for
the
money
spent,
these
are
outstanding
haven't
had
them
long,
but
so
far
they
are
awesome
really
like
these
heaphones
for
such
an
amazing
price,
noise
cancellation
is
amazing,
battery
life
is
great,
play
music
nonstop
during
school
and
it
lasts
me
several
46
hours
days
of
constand
use
with
limited
standbyethey
are
so
light
in
your
ears
but
they
don't
feel
like
they
will
break
it
good
buy,
if
you
want
something
quick
after
1/2
months
the
left
ear
phone
stopped
working
so
if
you
plan
on
using
it
long
time,
but
another
brand
really
didnt
want
to
spend
ton
of
money
on
wireless
earbuds
would
only
use
for
working
out,
but
man
these
are
perfect,
they
stay
in
the
ear,
last
at
least
hours
at
max
volume,
and
work
great
im
glad
bought
these
very
affordable
and
am
enjoying
this
unitit
fits
the
purpose
of
my
life
style
when
working
or
long
walks\running
takes
sometime
to
get
used
to
since
this
is
my
first
bluetooth
device
for
while
maybe
45
years
so
like
the
fact
that
the
charging
case
takes
long
time
for
it
to
be
recharged
do
believe
that
one
improvement
can
be
made
is
to
design
the
volume
to
be
little
louder
for
the
iphone
but
volume
works
great
on
windows
10
am
loving
these
earbuds
they
are
comfortable
and
easy
to
operate
love
the
buttons
on
there
where
actually
know
that
am
pushing
the
right
area
on
the
buds
for
volume
and
calls
and
bending
,
jumping
and
walking
they
are
not
budging
love
them
have
finally
found
earbuds
that
fit
in
my
narrow
ear
canals
and
don't
slip
out
while
running
and
sweating
having
portable
charger
is
even
better
professional
packaging,
great
design
and
they
stay
in
place
earbuds
fall
out
all
the
time
so
was
thrilled
these
stayed
in
place
highly
recommend
very
impressed
ve
been
using
these
earbuds
every
since
got
them
and
charged
the
case
the
sound
quality
is
awesome
seriously
the
other
bluetooth
headphones
ve
purchased
when
talking
on
the
phone
others
would
hear
buzzing
and
have
to
cut
them
off
but
not
these
very
clear
reception,
no
background
noise,
music
is
crystal
clear
am
very
satisfied
and
the
price
you
cannot
beat
it
after
first
wearing
these
wireless
earbuds
was
quite
impressed
the
fit
was
even
better
than
my
pro
beats
the
tips
stayed
in
my
ears
and
the
bass
was
superbgreat
purchase
love
them
for
the
gym,
not
as
loud
as
other
earbuds
but
they
fit
and
feel
great
could
do
little
better
on
sound
quality
but
good
buy
for
the
money
fit
my
small
ears
really
well,
sound
quality
for
calls
&
audio
is
great
had
it
about
month
no
problems
incase
charging
is
convenient
feature
the
headphones
are
pretty
well
sounding
have
been
using
them
for
little
over
week
now
while
at
gym,
&
no
complaints
on
sound
&/or
connectivity
these
headphones
sound
amazing
they
are
so
much
better
than
the
headphones
that
came
with
iphone
and
they
stay
on
my
ears
wonderfully
on
my
mile
walks
these
headphones
are
great
so
far
good
sound
quality
and
noise
cancellation
the
only
thing
wish
is
that
people
could
hear
me
bit
better,
but
still
figuring
out
this
feature
their
customer
service
has
been
helpful
best
headphones
have
had
so
far
great
clean
crisp
sound
and
nice
deep
bass
and
well
worth
this
low
bargain
price
very
confrontable
around
the
ear
fit
best
ear
buds
have
owned
these
earbuds
paired
up
quickly
and
easily
with
my
android
phone
purchased
these
based
on
previous
reviews
and
because
they
had
the
extra
piece
that
holds
them
in
your
ear
my
previous
set
of
$150
earbuds
were
constantly
falling
out
of
my
ears
when
working
or
exercising
these
stay
in
place
nicely
you
can
get
better
sound
quality
with
higher
priced
buds,
but
the
sound
quality
achieved
at
this
lower
price
point
makes
these
great
buy
imo
these
earbuds
are
great
easy
to
set
up
and
sound
quality
is
very
good
stay
on
ear
well
and
very
comfortable
use
at
night
to
listen
to
audio
books
with
these
you
can
use
just
one
earbud
would
highly
recommend
the
sound
quality
is
pretty
good
and
they
are
comfortable
they
never
feel
like
they
are
about
to
fall
out
of
my
ears
however,
they
go
in
and
out
of
sync
frequently
with
each
other
and
with
my
phone
they
also
disconnect
and
reconnect
with
my
phone
often
needed
earbuds
that
had
the
hook
that
goes
around
the
ear
these
fit
great
and
feel
very
secure
and
so
light
that
it
doesn't
feel
like
i'm
wearing
them
haven't
had
chance
to
use
them
lot
so
far,
but
the
phone
call
made
appeared
to
be
clear
and
with
no
issues
love
having
actual
buttons
to
push
for
functions
and
the
volume
right
on
the
earbud
sound
quality
is
very
good,
pairs
easily
with
my
phone,
and
picks
up
phone
calls
well,
there
is
little
background
noise
for
the
person
on
the
other
end
of
the
call
but
nothing
that
causes
an
issue
and
they
calls
are
pretty
clear
on
my
end
customer
service
from
the
company
was
good
quick
to
respond
these
wireless
earbuds
were
easy
to
use
right
out
of
the
charging
case
which
is
nice
and
sleek,
longer
and
less
bulky
than
the
earbud
case
my
husband
uses
earbuds
paired
easily
and
have
great
sound
bought
these
to
use
at
the
gym
and
appreciate
the
comfortable
fit
and
the
fact
that
they
stay
in
place
which
is
important
highly
recommend,
great
quality
at
great
price
so
far
so
good
great
quality
and
very
good
fit
excellent
quality
on
the
case
as
well
great
choice
in
my
opinion
definitely
good
value
for
the
price
paid
these
earbuds
are
perfect
have
small
ears
and
had
issues
in
the
past
with
size
of
the
earbud
and
them
staying
in
this
product
offers
variety
of
sizes
that
fit
the
ear
piece
side
hooks
over
the
ear,
not
too
big
or
small
can
still
wear
my
glasses
and
even
my
facemask
with
them
on
sound
quality
is
great,
works
with
my
phone
and
laptop,
highly
recommend
this
product
to
others
like
the
carry
case/charger,
it's
nice
size
also
like
that
can
use
just
of
them
at
time
good
audio
quality,
comfortable
fitfor
the
price
point,
would
recommend
these
to
anyone
looking
for
pair
defective,
does
not
pair
properly
call
quality
cuts
in
and
out
has
no
noise
cancellation
needed
wireless
that
wrapped
around
the
ear
and
provided
clear
sound
for
audiobooks
these
fit
the
bill
the
problem
with
these
is
when
i'm
bending
down
to
do
laundry
they
stop
working
they
just
put
what
ever
i'm
listening
to
on
pause
everytime
reach
for
sock
or
something
have
tried
so
many
different
bluetooth
wireless
earbuds
over
the
years
and
this
model
has
the
best
deep
bass
definitely
keeps
the
energy
going
when
i'm
at
the
gym
it's
very
lightweight
and
comfortable
once
found
the
best
of
the
three
different
sizes
of
earbuds
tips
also
love
that
either
of
the
two
can
be
the
master
earbud
use
one
for
phone
calls
on
my
drive
to
the
gym
and
the
second
connects
immediately
when
put
it
on
for
music
after
arriving
audífonos
de
excelente
calidad,
fácil
de
usar,
el
precio
fue
muy
bueno
son
excelentes
para
usarlos
cuando
salgo
correr
muy
recomendados
superb
sound
and
durable
quality
they
dont
fall
off
my
ears
while
i'm
working
out
which
is
why
got
these
in
the
first
place
the
charging
bank
is
super
cute
and
protects
the
earphones
love
them
great
noise
cancellation
and
sound
quality
the
case
is
super
high
tech
also
about
to
go
on
my
first
run,
so
ll
follow
up
with
how
they
stay
in
great
value
i'm
very
impressed
with
the
comfortable
fit
easy
to
use
with
nice
accessible
controls
nice
charging
case,
very
good
sound
stars
so
when
bought
these
headphone
bought
them
for
work
use
one
at
time
and
love
that
one
ear
piece
at
will
last
me
though
most
of
my
shift
and
that
they
fit
nice
and
snug
in
my
ear
and
if
you
sweat
at
work
it
doesn't
damage
the
products
sound
quality
also
like
the
fact
that
it
has
noise
cancelling
ear
piece
for
the
price
of
the
head
phones
it's
great
product
if
you
lose
the
original
usb
you
won't
be
able
to
charge
it
i've
tried
using
other
android
usb
cords
and
they
will
not
fit
into
the
slot
is
larger
than
most,
but
works
well,
and
that
is
what
mattered
to
me
in
the
beginning
the
hooks
may
slightly
hurt,
but
you
get
used
to
them
as
they
fit
your
ear
betterthis
review
was
written
after
using
the
product
and
in
turn
for
another
pair
of
earbuds
if
you
win
the
prize
this
doesn't
take
away
from
the
truthfulness
of
my
review
these
are
garbage
i've
been
using
these
and
am
extremely
pleased
with
how
they
sound,
their
ease
of
use
and
the
battery
life
the
fit
comfortably
and
use
them
daily
after
30
minute
ride,
music
starts
to
cut
off
it
automatically
turns
off
and
ondon
buy
just
received
the
earbuds
just
today
but
so
far,
based
on
my
limited
experience,
so
good
am
looking
forward
to
taking
advantage
of
them
to
listen
to
my
tv
shows,
music,
movies,
etc
if
you
are
looking
for
blue
tooth
earphones
with
comfortable
and
good
ear
clip
this
is
the
product,
the
bluetooth
connection
is
very
easy
and
charging
system
is
very
good
just
got
my
order
and
so
far
they
connected
easily
did
take
minute
for
the
other
speaker
to
kick
in
which
worried
me
but
then
was
fine
so
far
so
good,
sound
is
amazing
reserve
the
right
to
change
review
after
extended
use
i've
had
bad
luck
with
every
other
pair
i've
purchased
with
them
shorting
out
and
not
working
hopefully
these
are
the
ticket
for
the
price
these
are
very
good
headphones
decent
bass
and
sound
from
these
you
obviously
can't
compared
these
to
200
headphones
but
they
are
not
meant
to
replace
them
very
happy
with
performance
for
the
price
pretty
disappointed
in
these
earbuds
like
my
earphones
to
be
loud
and
have
bass
and
these
don
give
me
that
do
like
the
little
charger
but
it
doesn
take
long
for
that
or
that
earbuds
to
run
out
of
battery
only
had
them
for
month
or
so
and
the
left
is
already
broken,
didn
do
anything
for
it
to
stop
working
so
this
was
no
for
me
will
not
be
purchasing
again
these
are
fantastic
bought
them
for
my
husband,
who
has
tinnitus
they
are
soft
and
fit
him
comfortable
to
lie
in
bed
and
listen
to
music
and
no
wires
in
the
way
really
good
earbuds,
with
impressive
sound
quality
for
the
price
my
earbuds
battery
life
last
about
78
hours,
and
case
life
about
45
days
depends
on
how
much
you
use
it
very
comfortable
on
the
ears,
the
only
thing
would
fix
is
the
hook
so
that
it
feels
tighter
around
the
ear
all
in
all,
pretty
good
earbuds
would
recommend
have
been
using
these
couple
days
and
so
far
love
them
they
fit
nicely
in
my
ears
and
don
feel
like
they
will
fall
out
not
headphone
buff
but
that
sound
is
great
for
my
use
and
it
definitely
cancels
noise
to
the
point
where
didn
realize
right
away
my
kid
woke
from
their
nap,
oops
great
sound,
love
all
the
buttons
they
have
to
control
sound
and
switching
of
the
songs
and
answering
your
phone
it
also
has
long
range
feel
like
from
your
phone
battery
life
is
good
use
them
at
work
and
then
when
workout
usually
charge
them
overnight
and
ve
never
had
them
run
out
of
juicelove
the
way
they
fit
and
the
sound
quality
is
great
even
on
phone
callswont
disappoint
purchased
these
b/c
the
other
earbuds
have
fall
out
of
my
ears
these
have
the
hook
so
it
keeps
them
secure
and
love
the
charging
case
great
headphones
work
fabulous
the
battery
pack
for
the
head
phones
isnt
holding
charge
for
very
long
was
dead
by
the
end
of
the
first
day
had
it
most
comfortable
inear
headphones
have
ever
had
have
small
ears
and
these
fit
right
in
without
feeling
like
have
grape
shoved
in
my
ear
and
the
sound
is
great
am
really
enjoying
this
product
so
far
they
keep
good
bluetooth
connection,
unlike
my
last
pair
they
seem
durable
enough
and
they
stay
in
my
ear
good
have
noticed
few
times
the
volume
buttons
didn't
seem
to
work,
but
whenever
try
it
with
my
phone
screen
unlocked
they
always
work,
so
maybe
it's
just
me
love
the
long
battery
life
they
last
all
day
no
matter
how
much
use
them
overall
they
are
great
headphones
well
worth
the
price
the
first
time
we
were
charging
it,
it
started
smelling
badly
like
something
was
burning
it
made
the
whole
area
of
the
house
smell
and
luckily
we
were
able
to
figure
out
that
this
is
what
was
causing
it
before
it
started
fire
or
something
made
sure
the
headphones
were
fully
charged
three
different
times
before
running,
and
they
continually
turned
on
and
off
for
my
entire
run
returned
them
update:
cable
got
frazzled
in
one
month;
my
replacements
don
fit
for
some
reason
never
had
cables
frazzle
so
quick
now
it
is
junk
every
time
move
my
mouth
inhear
metallic
crinkling
noise
the
sound
quality
is
awfulthese
are
absolutely
horrible
earbuds
use
one
earbud
at
time
and
turn
volume
really
low
and
sound
is
still
great
connects
well
on
my
laptop
and
phone
battery
life
has
been
awesome
charged
it
when
first
bought
them
it's
been
about
week
and
i'm
still
above
70%
but
maybe
dont
use
them
as
much
as
most
would
bought
these
for
my
wife
as
christmas
present,
and
wish
would
have
bought
myself
pair
as
well
excellent
sound
quality,
great
noise
cancellation,
and
great
fit
love
the
battery
charge
read
out
that
is
super
helpful
and
feature
wish
had
on
previous
pairs
of
headphones
would
definitely
recommend
these
they
are
very
good
quality
earbuds
bought
them
for
my
wife
as
christmas
gift
she
really
enjoys
the
sound
quality
for
the
price,
these
earbuds
are
very
good
they
are
comfortable
and
stay
securely
in
my
ear
during
fast
paced
walk
sound
is
good,
too;
like
that
can
use
one
at
time
if
want
omg,
i've
had
these
bluetooth
for
days
absolutely
love
them
❤
lightweight,
sound
is
absolutely
inpecibule,
feels
like
don't
have
anything
over
my
ear
and
i've
gone
through
lot
of
bluetooths
would
definitely
recommend
this
brand
price
point
is
on
point
this
works
as
advertised
has
consistantly
connected
and
initial
setup
was
straight
forward
/
very
low
effort
after
removing
from
case
the
case
setup
with
the
phones
is
smart
the
recharge
in
the
case
which
helps
ensure
you
don't
lose
the
earphones
either
is
fine
to
stick
in
the
pocket
of
mens
pockets
but
will
be
bulky
for
other
styles
wear
mine
for
running,
however,
the
microphone
quality
apparently
is
also
good
these
earbuds
are
awesome
normal
earbuds
always
fall
out
of
my
ears
but
these
weightlessly
fit
around
the
ears
and
won't
fall
out
did
run
test
and
high
movement
test
and
they
stayed
comfortably
in
place
sound
quality
is
great
super
pleased
like
them
so
much
that
purchased
another
pair
the
sound
is
great,
they
are
comfortable
the
battery
life
is
really
good
too
these
earbuds
so
far
are
very
nice
like
how
they
fit
and
love
the
sound
it
is
clear
and
has
good
bass
have
only
used
them
times
while
work
out
so
have
not
really
tried
to
change
songs
or
volume
too
much
but
when
did
it
didn't
seem
to
work
had
to
change
it
on
my
phone
have
gotten
phone
call
while
wearing
them
and
the
caller
was
able
to
hear
me
clearly
like
the
charging
box
too
like
the
headphones
they
have
good
sound
quality
and
wireless
with
no
cord
they
fit
great
on
my
ears
don't
think
they
will
fall
off
battery
life
is
great
bought
this
as
christmas
present
for
my
wife
some
head
phones
have
tendency
to
fall
out
of
her
ears
but
these
have
stayed
in
for
her,
even
while
running
we
both
found
them
comfortable
and
they
were
easy
to
get
paired
with
bluetooth
devicesi
was
impressed
the
battery
life
and
really
like
the
display
that
shows
how
battery
life
is
leftdefinitely
worth
the
money
so
far
the
occiam
bluetooth
headphones
are
the
answer
to
everything
was
looking
for
in
workout
headphone
finally,
no
issues
whenever
need
to
adjust
them
and
they
don't
fall
out
am
so
used
to
having
headphones
stop
or
start
song
because
of
simple
pressthese
headphones
have
buttons
that
you
push
to
start
stop
and
also
to
adjust
the
volume
am
beyond
thrilled
that
made
this
purchase
the
sound
quality
is
really
nice,
the
ear
buds
fit
great,
&
are
comfortable
over
the
ear
the
battery
lasts
so
much
longer
than
my
other
buds
did
when
these
eventually
die
on
me,
will
definitely
order
again
earbuds
came
in
record
time
and
arrived
partly
charged
used
them
immediately
and
have
been
using
them
for
the
past
days
on
the
same
charge
that
it
arrived
with
these
earbuds
are
the
best
sounding
bluetooth
device
that
have
ever
used
and
the
battery
life
is
nothing
short
of
amazing
the
sound
quality
is
very
good
for
the
price
battery
life
is
amazing,
not
even
below
75%
after
an
hour
shift
only
complaint
is
little
static
when
running
another
app
with
sound
with
music
going
but
it's
not
bad
your
browser
does
not
support
html5
video
great
for
running,
doesn't
slip
around
because
of
the
loop
and
rubber
ear
bud
they
are
nice
and
small
so
they
fit
easily
under
hats
great
sound,
deep
base
while
these
don't
specifically
advertise
noice
cancelling,
the
inear
fit
is
so
good
that
it
does
actually
provide
that
feature
excellent
battery
life
and
clean
clear
sound
don
like
the
shape
of
the
more
popular
pod
design,
these
stay
in
my
ear
perfectly
and
comfortable
at
fraction
of
the
price
love
the
design,
the
noise
cancelling
buds
combined
with
ear
hooks
are
perfect
for
vigorous
activity
my
only
complaint
is
the
case
cover's
hinge
broke
after
day,
and
now
must
be
careful
not
to
lose
it
sound
quality
is
outstanding
very
clear
&
perfect
fit
on
my
ears
the
charging
case
display
well
designed
really
like
the
ability
to
see
the
power
display
&
the
display
for
each
earbud
also
having
the
option
of
using
or
both
earbuds
is
great
can
always
have
one
charging
when
using
the
other
highly
recommend
ready
to
go
right
out
of
the
box,
super
easy
to
use
and
stayed
on
during
yoga
inversionsi
cannot
attest
to
the
battery
life
just
yet
they
work
great
really
happy
with
these
headphones
work
in
factory
so
its
very
nosey
in
there
they
cancel
out
majority
of
the
machines
going
for
not
being
an
osha
product
my
partner
uses
one
headphone
while
use
the
other
we
can
go
good
distance
too
and
it
still
play
without
messing
up
by
the
end
of
my
shift
there's
still
plenty
of
battery
left
in
the
charger
and
with
headphones
would
definitely
recommend
these
this
product
seems
like
it
will
be
the
right
thing
for
my
husband
sound
quality
is
good,
he
like
the
piece
that
goes
over
the
ear
versus
just
placing
in
the
ear
feel
amazing
on
my
ears
and
stay
in
place
love
them
don't
care
for
regular
buds
as
my
ears
are
small,
so
these
are
just
right
they
are
made
of
durable
materials
as
well
these
headphones
are
so
comfortable
they
connected
easily
to
my
kindle
the
sound
is
clear
my
favorite
part
is
can
use
one
and
leave
the
other
in
the
case
like
to
listen
with
one
ear
to
my
book
but
be
able
to
hear
my
surroundings
awesome
would
buy
these
again
they
are
comfortable
and
feel
secure
on
my
ears
just
received
them
and
am
excited
to
try
them
out,
but
so
far
they're
exactly
what
need
haven't
tested
it
with
my
computer
yet
but
with
the
phone
it's
great,
and
the
earbuds
fit
my
ears
and
are
comfortable,
which
are
usually
an
issue
since
have
small
ear
canals
the
hooks
and
small
covers
make
it
snug
fit
the
sound
is
really
clear
and
the
music
quality
sounds
good
just
made
the
jump
to
bluetooth
earbuds
few
days
ago
so
far
so
good;
this
product
has
been
as
advertised
used
it
twice
they
have
great
fit
and
great
sound
quality
especially
for
the
price
they
stay
in
my
ears
better
than
more
expensive
air
pods
the
sound
quality
is
great
and
the
battery
lasts
well
use
these
headphones
at
work
for
phone
calls
and
music
handsfree
really
like
these
headphones
needed
headphones
that
securely
wrapped
around
my
ear
buying
these
for
my
mom
so
its
easier
for
her
to
pick
up
the
phone
and
dance
while
cleaning
lol
they
were
delivered
very
quickly
and
will
work
perfect
for
bluetooth
&
music,
love
that
you
can
use
them
independently
great
soundsi
love
that
these
stay
in
my
ears
have
other
ear
buds
but
will
not
stay
in
my
ears
they
fall
out
love
these
my
mother
in
law
loves
themthe
sound
is
clear,
it
is
perfect
and
confortable
around
the
earvery
happy
with
my
purchase:
pretty
good
it's
my
first
time
using
wireless
and
am
definitely
not
disappointed
the
range
is
amazing,
the
sound
quality
had
me
shook,
the
microphone
could
be
bit
better
and
it
does
cut
out
small
amountbut
it
comes
right
back
love
these
headphones
and
they
are
the
best
i've
had
so
far
would
definitely
purchase
more
of
them
from
this
company
love
how
they
fit
on
my
ear
and
are
not
easily
shaken
they
charge
so
amazing
and
the
sound
is
amazing
thank
you
great
sound
and
noise
cancellation
other
buds
kept
falling
off
these
stay
in
and
feel
great
don't
feel
like
they
are
going
to
fall
off
just
opened
the
package
but
if
give
them
stars
get
lifetime
warrantyalthough
at
first
glance
between
the
noise
canceling/
sounds
quality
i'm
not
regretting
putting
stars
have
another
pair
that
go
around
my
ear
these
fit
better
and
the
quality
is
so
much
better
would
buy
again
love
the
size
and
wireless
of
the
headphones
you
can
choose
to
just
have
one
in
your
ear
as
they
both
have
mics
rarely
write
reviews
but
these
are
my
2nd
pair
of
earbuds
in
the
last
60
days
and
just
got
them
first
of
all
they
actually
stay
on
and
in
my
small
ears
even
the
iphone
earbuds
fall
out
plus
they
were
fully
charged
upon
arrival
literally
opened
the
box,
put
them
on,
went
to
bluetooth
on
my
phone
and
there
they
were
all
in
less
than
minute
impressive
these
headphones
paired
quickly
and
easily
with
my
phone
unlike
several
other
pairs
have
used
love
the
charging
case,
as
with
my
old
headphones
would
have
to
remember
to
plug
them
in
periodically
and
they
would
often
be
dead
when
would
go
to
use
them
also
love
that
they
come
with
multiple
size
earbuds
need
the
smallest
size
and
it
can
be
difficult
to
find
earbuds
that
stay
in
my
ears
but
these
are
great
ear
buds
worked
fine
but
only
until
they
ran
out
of
battery
charging
case
never
worked
and
can't
recharge
buds
was
looking
for
my
first
pair
of
earbuds
on
amazon
and
when
came
across
these
they
spoke
to
me
having
the
piece
that
goes
behind
my
ears
was
important
to
me
these
seemed
to
fit
the
bill
and
are
priced
right
just
got
them
and
they
are
as
good
as
advertised
was
pleasantly
surprised
with
these
earbuds
hesitated
to
use
wireless
yes,
i'm
old
school,
but
these
proved
to
be
easy
to
charge,
easy
to
pair
with
my
phone,
and
easy
to
use
for
phone
call
you
won't
be
disappointed
if
you
choose
these
earbuds
paid
the
same
price
for
another
""wireless"
earphone
with
the
cord
connecting
them
and
these
don't
have
the
connecting
cord
as
they
are
truly
wireless
they
come
with
cool
charging
case
and
the
battery
life
is
good
they
fit
well
also
compared
to
the
high
price
for
other
wireless
earphones
these
sure
do
the
job
this
product
is
fine
but
im
writing
new
review
because
in
my
package,
received
scratch
off
to
where
won
another
pair
of
the
headphones
once
notified
them
and
went
through
process
to
get
my
free
set,
per
their
instructions,
still
did
not
receive
my
free
set
emailed
them
month
later
and
they
did
not
even
respond
its
seems
to
me
that
they
just
want
you
to
give
them
five
stars
so
their
product
can
at
top
of
the
search
ve
only
had
them
for
few
days
but
they
re
everything
needed
so
far
easy
to
pair,
decent
battery
life,
and
like
that
the
case
shows
me
the
charge
level
for
both
the
headphones
and
the
case
itself
super
clear
and
easy
to
use
does
not
strain
ear
canal
like
other
inear
buds
love
that
can
use
either
one
or
both
also
has
actual
buttons
so
you
know
where
to
click
stead
of
frantically
feeling
around
for
the
right
spot
replaced
my
apple
pods
with
these
ve
just
received
these
earbuds
and
so
excited
about
them
the
sound
is
awesome
and
they
way
that
it
fits
in
my
ear
cuts
out
all
outside
noises
and
just
gives
clear
sounds
into
my
ear
haven
had
them
long
enough
to
review
the
battery
quality
but
love
that
you
can
charge
the
case
that
they
are
housed
in
and
then
take
it
with
you
in
case
you
need
wireless
charge
later
these
were
95%
charged
when
received
with
very
clear
instructions
on
setting
up
the
pairing
to
the
cell
phone
great
battery
life
like
that
fact
that
you
can
use
one
ear
piece
alone
and
if
individually,
it's
18
hrs
total
these
are
some
of
the
best
earbuds
have
found
switched
to
the
smaller
tips
and
they
are
super
comfortable
they
are
very
lightweight
and
so
far
have
worked
really
well
they
do
not
pull
on
your
ears
at
all
the
only
thing
have
noticed
is
when
someone
called
me
they
cut
in
and
out
some,
but
think
that
was
due
to
signal
not
the
earbuds
these
over
the
ear
bluetooth
headphones
are
comfortable
use
them
when
walking
and
doing
yardwork
around
the
house
they
sound
good,
come
with
an
assortment
of
ear
buds
covers,
usb
cord
and
the
case
has
charge
level
indicator
if
they
last,
this
is
great
option
for
the
price
point
am
glad
bought
them
they
are
amazing
earbuds,
but
they
broke
so
easily
after
having
them
for
only
week
enjoyed
them
but
will
not
be
purchasing
new
pair
loved
the
fit
it
is
really
comfortable
it
is
great
that
you
can
see
the
power
level
in
the
charging
case
like
them
better
than
more
expensive
brands
spar
earpieces
to
customize
fit
is
definite
plus
the
headphones
are
great
product
they
feel
good
in
my
ears
even
with
mask
on
pairing
them
to
my
phone
was
snap
the
sound
quality
is
pretty
good
despite
its
affordability
tend
to
think
you
get
what
you
pay
for
beyond
that,
really
like
how
either
side
can
be
the
dominant
controlling
side
earbuds
are
great
as
expected
quick
to
charge
and
both
earbuds
paired
together
and
with
my
phone
real
simplyonly
used
for
little
while
but
everything
is
good
so
far
it's
extremely
easy
to
use
which
safes
lot
of
time
when
answering
calls
i'm
still
learning
about
it
will
update
review
after
testing
these
are
so
cool
they
are
comfortable
to
wear
and
the
sound
quality
is
very
good
for
both
parties
love
that
you
can
use
one
at
time
or
both
they
conveniently
charge
in
the
case
at
the
same
time
easy
to
use
they
sound
good
they
lack
that
bass
punch
that
you
get
with
full
size
headsets
but
they
are
still
impressive
usually
do
not
like
inner
earbuds
but
these
fit
very
comfortably
and
do
not
fall
out
no
matter
how
hard
try
sound
quality
is
great
as
well
lots
of
base
also
love
the
settings
for
changing
song/answering
calls
you
have
to
actually
click
the
buttons
on
the
earbuds
which
prevents
you
from
accidentally
hanging
up
on
someone
or
changing
the
song
when
you
don
want
to
big
fan
love
the
hassle
free
packaging
the
headphones
are
awesome
just
received
them
in
the
mail
&&
they
sound
great
can
wait
to
try
them
when
go
running
husband
got
them
for
christmas
aka
already
opened
them
but
seems
very
impressed
with
the
quality
and
likes
the
over
the
ear
option
the
earbuds
and
case
were
fully
charged
within
the
hour
and
the
sound
is
fantastic
they
are
very
comfortable
too
have
small
ear
canals
so
have
not
had
successes
with
any
earphonesthese
were
miraclestayed
in
place

entire
length
of
my
walk
the
sound
quality
was
good
and
battery

great
alsofor
the
price
they
are
amazing
used
my
headphones
as
soon
as

and
blocked
out
most
of
the
background

on
my
concept
with
my
kids
playingscreaming
in
the
background
and
couldn't
hear

clarity,
excellent
noise
cancelling,
extremely
user
friendly
great
quality
for
the
price

these
for
my
husband

on
recommendation
from
some
website

glad

you
don
want
to
spend
so
much
money
on
air

work
anymore
lol
im
only
allowed
to
put
on
earbud
on
one
ear
and
even
just
on
one
ear,
cant

clearly
when
someone

great
sound
quality,
blocks
pretty
much
all
sound,
and
they
stay
in
my
ears
perfectly
love
them
these
are
amazing
$25
head
phones
wouldn't
expect
beats,
but
you
aren't
paying
for
those
they
do
exactly
what
they
claim,
have
great
sound
quality
and
battery
life
very
happy
with
my
purchase
just
hooked
up
my
new
ear
buds
to
my
phone
and
it
was
very
easy
the
sound
is
great
and
has
good
base
to
it
gave
this
to
my
mother
in
law
and
she
loves
it
they're
very
easy
to
use,
quality
is
great,
the
sound
is
pretty
good
and
they're
quite
comfy
they
are
working
well
so
far
good
sound
good
fit
and
been
working
for
few
weeks
have
not
had
any
problems
with
them
to
this
point
good
buy
worth
the
money
sound
is
ok
not
great
you
can
use
them
as
head
phones
or
individually
charging
case
is
great
battery
life
is
pretty
good
they
work
really
well
good
sound
and
the
charging
case
is
nice
also
nice
that
it
shows
the
charge
level
the
bass
is
really
good
they
fit
very
well
and
have
small
ears,
so
the
fit
is
usually
an
issue
they
fit
really
well
wear
them
when
jog
and
never
feel
like
they
are
going
to
fall
they
have
great
sound
definitely
recommend
these
headphones
these
fir
the
ear
comfortably
and
do
not
irritate
it
controls
and
connection
of
these
is
easy
and
used
these
on
my
laptop
for
gaming
and
could
hear
them
well
but
they
could
barely
hear
me
but
fixed
that
in
pc
system
setting
under
device
master
volume
love
that
the
case
can
be
charged
and
charge
the
earbuds
without
being
plugged
in
they
paired
with
my
phone
instantly
sound
is
clear
but
don't
listen
to
music
secure
fit
in
ears
so
they
won't
get
lost
have
only
used
these
earphones
couple
of
times,
but
am
happy
with
them
so
far
they
are
very
good
fit
and
the
sound
quality
is
excellent
have
not
yet
tried
them
with
lot
of
background
noise,
but
expect
them
to
work
well
these
earbuds
are
exactly
what
needed
they
fit
securely
when
working
and
sound
great
for
the
price
great
features

not
have
made
better

of
the
box
awesome

of
earbuds
have
been
using
them
for
about
two
weeks
and
have
had
no
issues
solid,
deep
bass
highly
recommended
if
you
are
runner,
like
am
it
took
some
time
to
get
used
to
the
settings,
but
overall
really
like
headphones
received
the
headphones
on
thursday
of
last
week
and
today
tuesday
is
the
first
time
have
to
charge
the
case
they
definitely
are
noise
cancelling
which
is
nice
when
you
are
in
loud
area
very
good
value
fits
very
comfortably,
and
my
ears
have
had
challenges
with
many
others
very
good
sound,
at
least
for
spoken
voice
hopefully
they
last
occiam's
earbuds
have
great
sound
quality
for
listening
to
music
and,
so
far,
the
battery
life
has
been
good
during
phone
calls,
the
sound
quality
on
the
other
end
is
ok
to
good
these
headphones
are
pretty
awesome
for
the
price
the
case
itself
doesn
show
any
led
light
showing
the
charging
for
the
case
not
sure
if
missed
it
or
not
that
would
be
the
only
minus
for
me
but
overall
decent
product
so
far
they
work
great
the
only
thing
don't
like
is
they
won't
pair
to
more
than
one
thing
at
time
so
far
so
good
they
stay
on
extremely
well
and
that's
exactly
what
needed
for
working
out
and
running
amazing
ear
buds
for
the
money
works
great
when
watching
movies
with
amazon
fire
stick
holds
very
long
charge
great
quality
at
even
better
price
the
sound
quality
is
crystal
clear,
the
noise
cancelation
is
great
for
phone
calls
and
sofar
the
battery
life
is
great,
have
been
using
for
the
better
part
of
the
day
with
no
problems
now
the
only
thing
is
that
you
need
type
to
recharge
the
case
had
an
issue
with
the
original
pair
got,
contacted
customer
service
and
they
were
very
responsive
and
were
able
to
resolve
my
problem
quickly
sound
quality
is
good,
battery
life
is
great
like
everything
about
these
earbuds
very
good
deal
for
the
price
well
worth
the
money
and
my
wife
and
are
very
happy
with
them
great
noise
cancellation
though
definitely
not
100%
and
beautiful
audio
quality
comfortable
to
wear
for
few
hours
past
that
though
this
may
be
because
it's
in
combination
with
face
mask
it
can
make
your
ears
hurt
bit
battery
on
headphones
lasts
several
hours,
and
case
battery
lasts
for
up
to
week
even
when
headphones
are
used
frequently
love
these
they
are
super
comfortable
and
sound
great
surprised
at
the
amount
of
low
end
my
kids
are
now
jealous
as
they
like
these
better
than
their
app
le
airpods
these
are
awesome
great
sound
for
the
price
love
the
way
they
charge
they
are
very
comfortable
the
sound
quality
is
great
for
the
price
these
are
pretty
good
earbuds
really
can't
even
tell
that
they
are
on,
and
they
do
not
fall
out
of
my
ear,
like
other
ones
do
wish
the
volume
would
go
little
louder,
but
it
is
sufficient
also
wish
they
have
wireless
option
so
could
put
it
on
my
charging
pad
other
then
that
they
are
great
unfortunately
it
stopped
working
and
started
to
have
this
buzzing
noise
would
like
replacement
considering
its
only
been
two
and
half
weeks
they're
very
wonderful
headphones
and
say
on
during
all
of
my
exercise
routines
so
don't
want
to
swap
to
another
pair
but
can
only
use
one
headphone
now
comfortable,
quality
sounding
headphones
that
have
great
battery
life
stay
put
in
your
ears
while
exercising
defective
volume
up
and
down
doesn't
work
sound
is
not
good
can't
believe
all
those
star
ratings
someone
stuff
the
ballot
box
came
upon
this
one
after
trying
out
three
other
sets
of
earbuds
and
this
one,
by
far,
is
the
best
of
the
lot
well
designed,
easy
to
pair,
fits
snugly,
sounds
good,
has
tactile
switch,
and
shows
charging
levels
when
inserted
into
the
charging
box
excellent
value
also,
prompt
customer
service
comfortable
to
wear
it,
excellent
sound,
battery
holds
power
for
many
hoursi
use
it
to
workout
and
jogging,
keeps
on
place
without
falling
from
my
ears
would
recommend
good
price,
good
product
sound
quality
is
great
unbelievable
base
they
are
very
comfortable
on
your
ears
good
quality
and
great
customer
service
excellent
price
dislike
the
case
as
soon
as
flip
the
lid
it
comes
apart
in
my
hand
the
pin
is
missing
that
holds
it
together
im
very
upset
just
purchased
these
head
sets
also
now
it
doesn't
hold
charge
poorly
put
together
item
i'm
very
disappointed
these
earbuds
were
exactly
what
was
looking
for:
pair
of
blutooth
earbuds
that
could
be
used
either
together
or
separately
to
play
music
from
my
laptop,
my
phone
and
anything
else
that
accepts
blutooth
we
love
them***update***hubby
can
believe
that
they
are
such
great
quality
for
the
price
they
are
awesome
for
noice
canceling
got
these
for
my
husband
and
he
loves
them
so
far
the
battery
percent
indicator
is
neat
and
very
easy
to
charge
have
had
several
wireless
earbuds
and
these,
by
far,
have
the
best
sound
really
like
the
fact
that
they
have
the
hooks
so
that
they
will
stay
in
place
whether
am
running
or
mowing
the
yard
they
are
very
comfortable
and
being
able
to
see
the
amount
of
charge
on
both
the
case
and
the
earbuds
is
very
useful
love
my
new
earphones,
they
don't
fall
out
every
few
minutes
like
air
pods
don't
regret
this
purchase
work
construction
so
usually
one
wear
one
on
the
job
site
they
where
great
right
up
until
they
sucked
used
the
left
for
about
month
and
half
before
the
blue
tooth
would
cut
in
and
out
would
get
every
other
word
or
every
5th
word
switched
to
the
right
and
it
work
great
for
about
weeks
same
problem
battery
life
is
hit
or
miss
love
these
earbuds
they
exceed
my
expectations
the
sound
quality
is
amazing
great
purchase
these
earphones
are
great
at
this
price
pointquality
of
case,ear
phonesfit
and
various
ear
piecesreally
goodeasy
bluetooth
pairing
and
good
sound
qualitythe
ear
loops
keep
the
phones
secure
without
having
to
stick
the
ear
buds
way
into
the
ear
absolutely
love
it
easy
to
use,
my
ear
feels
comfortable
great
value
for
money
too
would
recommend
it
to
friend
earbuds
don
usually
fit
me
well
and
are
very
uncomfortable
so
far
these
have
bee
awesome
and
stay
in
place
welll
bought
these
to
use
in
the
office
so
far
love
them
they
stay
connected
via
bluetooth
and
has
great
sound
quality
recommend
these
if
you're
looking
for
cheap
price
with
great
quality
they
look
way
more
expensive
than
you
would
think
love
them
great
headphones
for
the
price
they
sound
good
haven't
run
with
them
yet
though,
i'll
update
after
using
for
work
on
conference
calls
audio
and
speakers
work
well
maximum
battery
life
is
approximately
hours
before
have
to
recharge
just
got
the
buds
yesterday,
but
love
the
ease
of
connectivity
that's
big
for
me
while
driving,
etc
the
case
is
sleek
and
the
buds
are
lightweight
and
easy
to
use
that
too
is
important
to
me
the
noise
cancellation
is
the
only
space
that's
questionable
for
me
as
my
dogs
snore
and
can
still
hear
them
while
wearing
the
earbuds,
but
that's
cool
guess
bought
of
these;
one
for
my
wife
and
one
for
me
out
of
the
box
the
device
paired
easily
with
my
galaxy
note
10+
as
well
as
my
wife's
apple
iphone
10
easy
to
follow
instructions
muddy
sound,
poor
lows,
treble
is
indistinguishable
good
for
phone
calls,
not
great
for
music
there
is
nothing
didn't
like
about
these
earphones
the
sound
quality
is
better
than
airpods
quick
charge
and
long
battery
life
would
definitely
recommend
these
for
yourself
or
as
gift
bought
them
based
on
its
reviews
and
was
not
disappointed
enjoy
the
comfort
and
the
stability
on
and
in
the
ear
as
go
bike
riding
and
need
that
security
the
charging
case
stays
charged
for
more
than
few
days
with
non
use
and
charges
up
fast
it
needs
to
be
charged
beautiful
and
sleek,they
are
very
comfortable
with
bendable
rubber
piece
that
wraps
around
the
earso
far,
so
good
super
quick
delivery
can
even
hear
my
music
while
on
my
lawn
mower
love
the
way
they
feel
and
they
don't
hurt
my
ears
totally
recommend
am
not
much
on
technology
so
was
hesitant
to
purchase
these
earbuds
am
so
glad
did
easy
to
use,
light
on
the
ears
and
great
sound
what
an
amazing
product
for
such
cheap
cost
like
the
fact
that
unlike
samsung
or
apple
pods,
these
go
over
the
ears
these
are
pretty
great
had
them
for
few
months
now
and
recently
had
one
go
missing
turns
out
put
it
in
the
wash
whole
wash
cycle
and
hours
of
just
sitting
at
the
bottom
of
wet
clothes
and
surprisingly
it
still
works
i'm
more
than
impressed
and
honestly
very
thankful
since
hate
having
just
one
earphone
say
they're
worth
the
money
after
that
yay
think
have
finally
found
the
right
wireless
headphones
for
me
must
have
weird
shaped
ears
because
all
the
other
ones
ve
tried
fall
out
when
running,
even
with
smallest
ear
bud
sound
is
great
and
ear
pieces
are
comfortable
hooray
since
my
ears
are
so
small,
regular
ear
buds
want
stay
in
my
ear
canal
this
was
the
best
decision
made
to
keep
them
hanging
onto
my
ears
after
one
full
use
charger
box
wont
charge
tjem
no
more
and
the
display
stops
working
worse
buy
have
bought
and
returned
earbuds
from
other
companies
in
the
past
weeks
like
these
though
just
enjoy
the
fact
that
it
has
buttons
operate
the
volume
and
to
turn
it
on
or
off
my
only
complaint
would
be
that
it
wasn
as
loud
as
expected
good
bass
though
ear
buds
stay
securely
on
the
ears
and
provide
nice
sound
the
case
charges
with
usbc
cord
with
is
great
comfortable
wireless
earbuds
that
stay
put
love
the
charging
carrying
case
super
convenient
great
price
and
work
the
same
as
most
expensive
ones
they
are
very
comfortable
with
bendable
rubber
piece
that
wraps
around
the
ear
the
ear
wraps
are
soft
and
flexible
and
not
noticeable
the
earbuds
fit
great
and
have
no
fear
of
them
falling
out
also,
microphone
for
phone
calls
is
very
good,
people
i've
called
said
they
hear
me
loud
and
clear,
no
buzzing
or
static
sound
quality
is
not
very
good
and
you
need
to
keep
your
phone
very
near
for
better
connection
great
bang
for
your
buck
very
responsive
customer
service
bought
occiam
bluetooth
headphones
as
back
up
for
my
"better"
earbuds
now
find
myself
using
occiam
all
the
time
am
very
pleased
with
the
robust
battery
life
bought
them
for
my
husband
and
he
loves
them
so
far
very
noise
cancelling
and
sound
like
you
are
completely
surrounded
by
just
the
music
the
battery
last
for
long
time
have
bought
earbuds
and
they
were
not
as
good
as
occiam
good
sound,
affordable
price,
very
good
deal
paired
easily,
very
comfortable
on
the
ears
like
the
fact
that
can
work
out
without
it
falling
out
of
my
ear
theses
are
the
best
bluetooth
headphones
have
ever
owned
they're
comfortable
and
have
great
sound
long
lasting
too
exactly
what
needed,
usually
wireless
headphones
like
air
pods
just
fall
out
so
these
are
perfect
great
product
was
looking
for
something
that
was
not
noise
canceling
and
these
are
perfect
the
traveling
case
is
small
and
compact
excellent
battery
life
great
quality
at
great
price
i've
been
searching
for
wireless
buds
for
while
it's
nice
to
have
pair
that
pairs
effortlessly
and
doesn't
pop
out
of
your
ear
and
bounce
under
the
car
when
you
yawn
only
worked
one
time
,
the
left
side
won't
even
turn
on
very
cheap
product
for
the
price
super
easy
to
pair
with
my
iphone
so
far
great
sound
quality
love
that
you
can
just
use
one
of
the
earbuds
if
you
need
to
easy
to
use
stay
on
especially
like
using
these
while
walking
or
working
in
the
yard
and
listening
to
audio
books
everything
about
this
item
is
good
except
for
one
thing
my
son
stated
that
the
ear
bud
on
the
right
side
has
little
static
in
it
so
he
might
be
returning
it
to
you
finally
some
headphones
that
work
spectacular
battery
life
prompt
delivery
thank
you
the
volume
output
and
noise
cancelation
are
wonderful
the
range
between
the
headphones
and
the
device
they
are
connected
too
is
great
can
walk
around
my
house
and
patio
without
losing
connectivity
battery
life
is
decent
as
well
the
waterproof
is
definetely
solid
tested
it
out
by
using
the
headphones
while
it
was
raining
and
there
was
no
problems
at
all
great
purchase
for
me
:
seem
to
work
good
battery
lasts
long
time
and
don
have
issues
with
staying
on
my
ear
ive
bought
lot
of
bluetooth
wireless
headphones
and
these
are
amazing
ive
found
some
great
one
that
ive
also
put
at
stars
but
my
opinion
these
are
the
best
these
are
low
profile
compared
to
others,
get
just
as
loud
as
others
ones
but
these
have
great
sound
quality
love
them
and
highly
recommend
just
received
these
headphones
they
came
quickly
and
setup
was
simple
and
effective
they
sound
great
and
no
problems
connecting
to
my
phone
the
charging
case
is
convenient
and
good
way
to
store
the
headphones
safely
got
these
for
my
daily
exercising,
and
the
sound
quality
comes
through
clear
through
all
of
my
workouts
so
far
so
good
great
product
just
wish
the
battery
lasted
full
hours
so
could
wear
all
day
at
work
loved
them
great
sound
quality
and
they
connected
with
my
smart
watch
super
fast
and
easy
like
the
way
that
they
stay
in
my
ears
and
how
can
hear
clearly
and
the
person
i'm
talking
with
heard
me
clearly
also
the
battery
life
is
great
also
was
great
at
first
but
after
few
uses
it's
very
sensitive
and
even
tilting
my
head
or
my
phone
moving
causes
the
sound
on
one
of
the
earbuds
to
cut
out
momentarily
pricier
than
most
moderate
earphones
hoping
for
the
best
will
comment
more
in
few
days
love
the
design
and
great
for
working
at
my
desk
and
listening
to
music
also
love
the
sound
quality
ve
ordered
plenty
of
headphones
from
china
looking
for
the
biggest
bang
for
the
buck
and
finally
found
it
sound
quality
is
better
than
most
headphones
and
the
charge
lasts
long
time
tried
running
with
these
today
and
these
fit
snug
in
the
ear
and
never
felt
that
they
were
going
to
fall
out
of
my
ears
definitely
great
value
for
the
price
the
reception
will
not
go
too
far
before
cutting
in
and
out,
and
the
bass
isn't
anything
exceptional,
but
they
are
decent
for
playing
games,
listening
to
music,
or
watching
movie
don't
expect
to
be
blown
away
with
these
headphones,
you'll
be
disappointed
bought
these
for
my
teen
daughter,
she
loves
them,
they
are
light
weight
and
comfortable
she
had
no
issue
pairing
it
up
and
the
sound
quality
is
really
good
good
battery
life
too
great
product
at
really
good
price
that
is
great
wireless
earbuds
for
me
sound
quality
is
good
also
the
battery
is
longer
these
bluetooth
sport
earbuds
are
good
value:
simply
well
designed
with
excellent
sound
at
very
good
price
five
stars
for
first
impressions,
but
will
reserve
or
subtract
one
star
until
after
use
them
for
two
years
since
other
brands
haven
lasted
beyond
that
period
for
me
if
get
two
years
of
use
than
ll
circle
around
and
give
stars
just
received
these
headphones,
and
they
were
easy
to
setup,
sounded
great
strong
bass
and
sound
was
pleased
about
the
lifetime
warranty
and
the
fast
responses
from
customer
service
received
worth
the
purchase
great
quality
sound
and
stays
in
my
ears
while
work
battery
life
is
amazing
honestly
just
received
earbuds
were
fully
charged
and
the
case
was
75%
easy
peasy
to

battery
life
later
great
product
fast
shipping
very
good
sound
quality
battery
life
lasts
all
day
like
the
fact
that
you
can
have
one
in
your
ear
while
the
other
one
is
charging
the
sound
is
amazing
so
light
weight
hardly
know
they
are
in
the
battery
life
and
range
are
great
these
earbuds
are
amazing
the
sound
quality
is
great
and
they
stay
in
place
even
with
high
intensity
cardio
workouts
definitely
recommend
them
the
sound
is
great
on
these,
if
your
looking
for
good
earbuds
this
is
the
one
for
you
received
these
for
christmas
lightweight,
long
lasting
battery
and
fantastic
sound
love
these
they
are
not
loud
enough
and
they
are
definitely
not
noise
canceling
do
like
the
way
they
fit
around
my
ears
though
also
the
range
is
not
very
good
use
them
to
replace
wireless
beats
headphones,
and
are
doing
an
amazing
results
like
the
soft
quality
of
the
earloop,
doesn't
irritate
ears
if
you
use
it
even
for
hours
the
sound
is
very
clear
one
of
the
nice
features
is
you
get
to
know
the
quantity
of
charge
on
each
left
and
right
earphone
this
is
my
first
pair
of
wireless
headphones
and
am
loving
them
they
stay
on
great,
the
sound
quality
is
great,
the
range
from
the
paired
device
is
good,
and
battery
life
seems
good
the
only
issue
initially
had
was
trying
to
change
the
size
of
the
ear
bud
it
was
really
hard
to
put
the
new
size
on,
but
guess
maybe
that
means
they
won't
fall
off
either
:
overall
they're
good
set
of
earbuds
that
don't
fall
off
because
of
the
ear
clips
not
too
tight
so
comfortable
to
wear
the
sound
quality
is
amazing
and
the
fit
is
comfortable,
where
there
is
no
chafing
or
discomfort
the
sound
quality
was
great
that
all
that
was
good
about
these
after
only
months
of
use,
they
won
charge
anymore
waste
money
they
sound
quality
is
great
battery
seems
to
last
good
while
just
got
them
these
bluetooth
headphones
are
awesome
i'm
mailman
and
listen
to
music
all
day
long
use
one
side
at
time
and
have
gotten
plus
hrs
out
each
one
they
sound
incredible
the
only
upgrade
did
was
buy
foam
ear
tips
didn't
like
the
tips
it
came
with
kept
coming
out
of
my
ears
other
than
that
you
can't
beat
them
on
price
and
quality
highly
recommended
these
wireless
earbuds
are
great
previously
tried
the
earbuds
without
the
ear
hooks,
but
they
kept
falling
out
of
my
ears
with
changing
the
ear
caps,
the
fit
is
great
and
the
ear
hooks
help
them
to
stay
in
place
the
noise
cancellation
feature
is
wonderful,
as
calls
are
clear
good
purchase
for
the
price
yes
loved
them
very
comfortable
behind
the
ears
noise
canceling
so
far
the
charge
is
great
charges
quickly
im
satisfied
worth
it
overall
great
product,
noise
cancelling
could
be
better
battery
life
is
so
so
as
can
get
about
hours
max
before
charging
these
headphones
are
great
great
quality
sound
and
the
microphone
works
great
as
well
just
have
the
headphones
for
couple
weeks
and
it
feels
weird
walking
around
the
house
without
needing
to
hold
my
phone
and
being
on
call
with
someone
only
minor
thing,
the
lit
of
the
case
was
little
bit
loose
just
days
after
got
it

how
to
tighten
it

but
so

so
good
seller
and
customer
service
have
been
great
at
any
of
my
inquiries
about
these
blue
tooth's
thanks
have
not
tried
them
yet,
but
do
like
the
digital
charging
and
like
the
case
been
using
them
off
and
on
for
few
days
now
and
still
have
great
battery
life
in
the
original
charge
of
the
case
great
sound
so
far,
decent
outside
noise
cancellation,
and
live
that
can
use
just
one
or
both
equally
well
they
paired
very
easily
with
my
phone
as
well
would
recommend
works
fine
for
me;
like
the
new
usbc
interface
and
led
displays
in
the
case
really
liked
this
product
bought
it
for
my
husband
for
christmas
he
really
liked
it
was
very
good
gift
idea
he
mainly
uses
them
for
when
his
cutting
the
lawn
to
exit
the
noise
from
the
tractor
with
music
charged
out
of
the
box
asks
for
review
right
away
looks
functional
for
the
price
definitely
recommend
it
it
works
great
and
they
also
give
you
free
gifts
bought
these
and
have
only
used
them
twice
charged
them
for
at
least
12
hours
and
they
lose
their
charge
and
die
within
hours
they
are
total
junk
and
waste
of
money
the
easiest
bluetooth
headphones
i've
ever
owned
paired
effortlessly
and
perfectly
stay
on
your
ear
during
workout
decent
noise
canceling
and
great
sound
only
wish
the
speakers
were
bit
louder
clear
sound
will
update
if
this
changes
with
age
bought
some
raycons
and
beats
that
just
didn't
age
well
decided
to
go
bit
cheaper
this
time
love
these
ear
phones
the
fit
is
perfect
the
sound
quality
is
great
battery
life
could
be
little
longer
overall
for
the
price
they
are
great
ps
they
are
very
comfortable
,
you
do
not
feel
them
in
your
ears
have
had
many
cordless
headphones
over
the
years
but
they
always
had
connecting
band
in
the
back
that
twisted
and
was
uncomfortable
these
earbuds
are
truly
wireless
with
great
sound
and
noise
cancellation
they
are
sleek
and
nonbulky
which
is
key
for
my
workouts
the
battery
life
is
shown
and
charging
is
easy
no
issues
at
all
your
browser
does
not
support
html5
video
by
far
the
most
comfortable
ear
buds
that
have
worn
excellent
sound
quality
with
plenty
of
battery
life
no
problem
with
hearing
the
other
end
of
the
phone
call
or
being
heard
cancels
any
background
noise
so
whether
listening
to
music
or
making
phone
call
the
sound
quality
is
premium
disclaimer:
i'm
still
super
excited
about
this
purchase
love
them
so
far
received
them
in
great
package
and
love
using
them
while
walking
or
working
out
speaker
quality
is
great
work
in
construction
these
didn't
break
the
bank,
stayon
on
my
ears
very
well,
help
to
reduce
the
harmful
effect
of
any
loud
noises
from
power
tools,
and
sound
pretty
darn
great
as
well
got
these
for
my
girlfriend,
as
her
previous
war
buds
kept
falling
out
she
loves
them
well
it
hard
for
me
to
give
review
because
was
riding
my
motorcycle
wearing
it
and
arm
tried
to
turn
the
volume
up
and
it
fell
out
of
my
ear
and
lost
it
on
don
know
if
the
volumes
loud
enough
for
me
hard
of
hearing
was
impressed
by
the
products
the
case
the
charger
and
how
easy
it
was
to
enter
bluetooth
into
it
but
that
my
final
they
look
great
they
fit
great
they
sound
great
i'll
update
as
needed
like
to
run
and
do
body
movement
exercises
and
have
had
trouble
friending
wireless
headphones
that
would
not
fall
out
of
my
ear
these
headphones
have
been
awesome,
they
dont
come
out
of
my
ear
while
i'm
running,
and
the
sound
quality
is
great
also
like
that
can
tab
on
the
right
ear
headphone
to
skip
and
song
or
the
left
to
go
back
and
replay
occiam
are
far
better
than
expected
it
is
obvious
based
on
initial
experience
the
proprietors
are
going
to
improve
on
the
tech
in
my
best
opinion
they
wanted
to
make
sure
sound
quality/
connection
stability
and
response
to
the
various
os
platforms
were
developed
this
tech
is
too
good
to
stop
here
garbage,
absolutely
garbage
and
no
won't
change
my
review
if
you
offer
me
free
stuff
the
sound
is
horrible,
they
do
not
charge
well
they
are
not
magneticheed
my
warning
people
love
the
way
they
fit
in
my
ear
they
aren't
noticeable
the
sound
is
perfect
this
is
something
would
purchase
again
if
needed
these
headphones
are
great
out
of
the
boxsetup
was
instant,
simple,
and
very
straightforward
didn't
even
need
to
look
at
instructions
transition
from
using
one
earbud
to
two
seems
seamlesssounds
better
than
my
old
mpow
flame
2's,
which
was
my
main
concerni'll
update
this
review
later
once
get
more
use
in
great
quality
for
the
price
my
son
loves
them
and
they
are
used
all
the
time
so
he
van
enjoy
things
on
his
phone
like
having
no
cords
while
i'm
taking
long
walks
and
listen
to
books
on
audible
the
earphones
arrived
todaythey
paired
easilysound
seemed
good,
but
right
away
noticed
the
sound
of
electrical
staticalready
packed
them
to
be
sent
back
really
bought
these
on
whim,
but
they
have
been
pleasant
surprise
use
them
for
phone
calls
and
to
listen
to
other
media
via
my
cell
phone
well
worth
the
price
for
me
the
headphones
fit
comfortably
and
sound
great
battery
power
last
long
time
these
earbuds
are
surprisingly
great
just
wanted
cheap
pair
for
jogging
these
are
everything
wanted
comfortable,
long
battery
life,
and
no
slipping
the
sound
quality
was
not
my
priority,
but
they
hold
their
own
mics
are
fine
for
calls
i'm
on
an
apple
no
connection
issues
just
everything
needed
them
to
be
because
my
tragus
is
pirece
it
uncomfortable,other
than
that
its
great
needed
these
wireless
headphones
to
walk
my
dog
without
having
to
hold
my
phone
or
be
attached
to
wires
personally
have
hard
time
keeping
other
headphones
in
my
ears,
and
wanted
something
with
bit
more
stability
and
these
do
the
tricki
really
love
the
look
of
the
charging
case
and
how
compact
it
is,
and
the
sound
quality
is
great
this
review
is
from
wearing
the
earbuds
for
just
day
10
plus
hrs
so
far
i'm
100%
satisfied
the
earbuds
are
lightweight,
doesn't
not
hurt
my
ear
at
times
forgot
it
was
in
my
ear
sound
quality
is
very
good
and
great
battery
life
also
like
how
the
case
tells
you
the
battery
life
and
that's
its
hard
case
the
sound,
performace
and
appearance
are
very

day
no
trouble,
great
sound,
definitely
sweatproof
and
comfortable
nice
head
phones
with
good
value
needed
new
pair
of
headphones
and
wanted
some
wireless
ones
that
didn't
have
to
worry
about
getting
in
my
way
during
exercise
haven't
gotten
to
work
out,
however,
they
work
perfectly
for
the
few
tasks
have
done
so
far
am
satisfied
and
do
recommend
them
because
they
are
great
so
far
the
quality
is
so
clean
and
crisp
looking
forward
to
the
30
hours
of
play
time
am
truck
driver
so
always
appreciate
headphones
that
are
comfortable
with
great
battery
life
1/3
of
the
price
of
powerbeats
and
am
already
impressed
bought
these
because
love
the
overtheear
feature
and
hate
anything
with
connecting
wires,
so
was
excited
to
try
these
it
took
few
tries
to
get
both
earbuds
connected
but
once
did,
was
very
happy
the
sound
quality
is
very
good
and
they
stay
in
place
really
well
love
it
it
was
just
as
described
love
how
nicely
it
was
displayed
very
nice
great
blue
tooth
automatically
connected
to
my
phone
as
soon
as
the
ear
buds
where
placed
on
my
ears
love
the
effortless
connectivity
also
absolutely
love
the
sleekness
and
fit
of
these
ear
buds
i'm
very
pleased
with
this
purchase
these
headphones
are
really
comfortable
and
sound
quality
is
superb
great
headphones
for
working
out
they
stay
on
well
with
good
sound
use
my
earbuds
for
music
these
earbuds
have
very
good
sound
to
them
the
ease
in
which
they
paired
with
my
phone
was
awesome
and
love
the
functions
they
have
my
other
ear
buds
didn't
do
all
that
love
that
don't
have
to
worry
about
them
falling
out
while
work
over
an
engine
updated:
they
do
not
hold
charge
at
all
and
we
re
not
worth
the
money
these
surpassed
my
expectations
they
are
very
nice,
are
able
to
be
pretty
loud
without
lowering
the
quality
of
the
sound,
and
love
all
the
commands
they
have
instilled
in
them
it
does
take
while
to
learn
them,
but
they
come
with
an
easy
to
understand
manual
would
definitely
recommend
will
be
returning
thesevolume
control
does
not
workvery
sad
bought
this
headphones
for
my
son,
and
he
is
very
happy
with
them
the
sound
volume
and
clarity
is
very
good
my
son
could
not
belive
that
these
headphones
had
comparable
quality
to
more
expensive
sets
overall,
i'm
very
happy
with
this
purchase
sound
quality
is
great
for
the
price,
but
not
in
the
same
league
as
name
brand
love
having
battery
meter
for
the
case
and
individually
for
each
earphone
don't
put
them
in
the
charging
case
sweaty
or
wet
or
the
terminals
will
corrode
quality
of
build
is
the
worst
part
you
can
hear
the
plastic
moving
when
you
push
buttons
while
they
are
in
your
ears
sound
great
like
how
they
stay
in
my
ears
even
when
i'm
active
quite
surprised
how
comfortable
these
are
great
sound
quality
for
music
haven't
tried
them
on
call
yet,
but
will
let
you
know
very
light
when
workout
it
doesn't
fall
of
my
ears
the
batteries
last
long
and
charge
rather
quickly
the
easiest
setup
ever
opened
the
box
put
the
earbuds
in
earwent
to
bluetooth
settings
on
phone
and
paired
it
is
good
product
with
good
price
it
is
comfortable
for
my
ear
and
its
sound
is
clean
with
full
charge,
am
using
it
for
more
than
day
one
issue
see
is
could
not
hear
my
wife's
voice
over
the
phone
call
when
she
was
driving
which
is
noisy
condition
guess
the
noise
cancellation
aldo
cancel
voice
when
environments
are
very
noisy
but
not
sure
so
far
so
good
very
comfortable
need
to
read
up
on
how
the
headphones
functions
love
the
case
and
not
sure
how
to
tell
if
it
is
charging
or
if
it
needs
to
be
charged
except
when
it
informs
me
that
it
needs
to
charge
really
like
how
they
fit
on
my
ears
and
like
that
can
use
one
or
two
ear
pieces
these
headphones
work
well,
good
volume
and
hold
charge
really
well
these
heads
up
display
of
the
battery
level
of
the
case
helps
so
far
love
these
earbuds
great
sound
quality
and
battery
life
love
that
can
use
either
eat
individually
good
battery
life
and
great
sound
for
kids
zoom
meetings
and
for
gym
work
out
really
great
buy
for
the
money
and
quick
shipping
love
to
do
business
with
this
company
again
these
are
really
nice
quality
they
stay
charged
and
fit
nicely
these
are
very
sleek
and
fit
perfectly
in
my
earthe
sound
is
also
pretty
good
happy
with
this
purchase
they
work
really
well
when
run
think
the
price
was
good
too
was
looking
for
pair
of
earbuds
that
would
be
comfortable
in
my
ear
to
wear
for
long
periods
of
time
these
fit
the
bill
also
liked
that
they
fit
comfortable
around
the
ear
too,
so
don't
have
to
worry
about
them
falling
out
great
sound
easy
to
use
features
10
for
10
would
order
again
finally
have
earphones
that
actually
stay
in
my
ears
so
am
so
happy,
thank
you
liked
the
earbuds
when
first
got
them
but
after
short
time
could
not
hear
in
the
left
side
and
then
they
stopped
charging
completely
and
so
have
to
return
them
after
having
them
for
just
three
weeks
headphones
are
comfortablesetup
and
blue
tooth
connection
is
easysound
quality
is
good
great
sound
quality,
easy
to
connect
and
comfortable
to
wear
best
part
the
are
overtheear
so
they
don
fall
out
while
am
running
was
hesitant
to
order
earbuds
as
have
not
had
success
in
the
past
these
are
comfortable
to
wear
and
like
that
can
only
use
one
when
walk
or
use
them
at
work
so
have
my
other
ear
unblocked
to
pay
attention
around
me
the
case
is
compact
and
easy
to
take
with
me
if
you
are
in
noisy
environment
the
sound
quality
is
less
than
to
be
desired
nothing
great
buy
easy
to
sync
because
it
literally
syncs
itself
with
minimal
help
from
me
very
please
with
these
occiam
bluetooth
headphones
am
hard
of
hearing
and
wear
glasses
the
sound
quality
is
better
than
any
buds
or
headphones
have
tried
they
are
secure,
comfortable,
and
easy
to
wear
with
glasses
can
put
these
on
in
the
morning
and
wear
them
all
day
without
recharging
headphones
were
great
the
first
few
days,
but
within
week
the
case
wouldn't
charge
went
through
the
motions
of
trying
different
cord,
outlet,
and
charging
block
no
luck
sounds
good
was
happy
when
got
them
nice
to
have
the
charging
dock
in
your
pocket
and
only
use
one
bud
for
calls
and
if
it
did
die
you
can
just
switch
buds
and
charge
it
up
just
received
my
occiam
ear
buds
and
so
far,
really
like
them
they
are
comfortable,
and
the
sound
quality
is
decent
the
volumewise
it
is
little
more
quiet
than
earbuds
ve
bought
in
the
past,
but
that
not
big
deal
to
me
all
in
all,
quality
is
good
for
the
money
got
this
for
my
husband
for
his
birthday,
he
really
need
new
one
for
his
job
but
he
didn't
want
to
spend
lot
like
the
ones
so
surprised
him
with
this
one's
they
have
good
battery
life
and
good
sound
quality
these
headphones
are
the
real
deal
perfect
performance,
battery
life
is
good,
and
the
price
cannot
be
beaten
owned
pair
that
cost
twice
the
price
and
they
were
subpar
compared
to
these
my
highest
recommendation
like
because
they
will
not
fall
out
of
your
ear
and
battery
last
long
time
occiam
bluetooth
head
phones
have
long
range
connectivity
the
functions
make
it
easy
to
use
i'm
happy
with
the
quality
these
headphones
are
very
nice
but
the
case
is
little
fragile
my
husband
works
as
cell
phone
tower
repairman
and
bought
him
pair
for
christmas
he
dropped
the
case
and
it
broke
at
the
hinge
but
he
just
taped
it
so
the
headphones
were
great
but
the
cases
little
bit
fragile
his
old
tws
headphones
had
different
kind
of
case
love
them
perfect
sound
quality,
gorgeous
design
highly
recommend
these
are
easy
to
operate
and
play
time
is
awesome
sound
is
great
too
great
heaphones,
sound
great,
connect
seamlessly,
can
use
one
or
the
other
or
both
really
good
quality
and
like
the
two
screens
letting
you
know
if
the
case
is
charged
and
the
headphones
are
as
well
like
others
have
said
the
case
is
great
with
the
screens
but
the
hinge
feels
soft
so
just
treat
it
with
care
like
baby
and
it
should
hold
up
nicely
volume
is
low
and
the
volume
controls
only
work
for
few
minutes
after
you
rest
them,
then
they
won't
adjust
up
or
down
tried
to
deal
with
it
for
about
week
and
it
just
wasn't
worth
it
it
paired
just
fine
and
the
calls
were
clear
battery
life
is
great
and
all
of
the
functions
worked
perfect
except
for
the
volume
controls
am
disappointed
the
sound
quality
and
comfort
are
superb
read
many
wireless
earbud
ratings
and
these
were
at
the
top
of
many
lists
very
pleased
with
performance
very
easy
to
set
up
and
pair
very
comfortable
to
wear
and
great
sound
the
sound
quality
very
good
it
is
easy
to
connect
to
transitioning
from
your
vehicle
to
the
head
phones
the
charging
case
is
cool
these
are
really
good
buy
have
bought
two
pairs
and
they
are
great
gift
good
sound,
comfortable,
and
the
bluetooth
range
seems
to
work
further
than
my
other
bluetooth
earbuds
my
son
was
looking
for
pair
of
wireless
headphones
and
decided
on
these
they
are
decent
pair
with
good
battery
life
and
quality
sound
perfect
for
run
sound
quality
is
excellent
nice
and
light
on
the
ears
as
well
highly
recommend
over
the
more
expensive
brand
clear
highs
and
clean
bass
great
headphones
for
the
price
audio
is
fantastic,
material
is
just
what
was
expecting
,
and
the
pieces
that
go
around
the
ear
are
made
of
nice
material
that
doesn't
irritate
my
ears
they
are
so
clear
for
the
price,
good
sound,
fits
good
also
very
comfortable
to
wear,
decent
sound
quality,
other
people
on
phone
say
they
can
hear
me
better
with
both
ear
pieces
vs
just
using
one
not
sure
on
the
distance
being
33
ft,
have
not
had
to
walk
away
from
phone
that
far
in
my
house
talk
time
is
about
56
hours
instead
of
but
just
put
back
in
my
case
to
charge
excellent
earbuds
love
how
long
they
last
before
they
have
to
be
charged
the
sound
is
nice
and
clear
and
they
re
really
comfortable
got
for
my
wife
as
she
can't
use
without
ear
support
very
good
and
stay
fit
in
ear
one
one
earbud
worked
when
got
it
out
of
the
box
do
not
buy
these
such
waste
of
money
only
one
side
works,
the
other
one
will
not
pair
at
all,
reached
out
to
the
company
to
ask
them
and
never
got
any
help
the
sound
cuts
out
on
calls
and
when
turned
all
the
way
up
you
can't
hear
still
original
review
is
part
of
warranty
request
the
case
is
nice
and
the
ear

seem
good
quality
will
update
review
is
necessary
but
so
far,
we
are
happy
with
the
product

very
impressed

helpful
for
someone

me

outside
and
likes
to
have
info
like
that
quickly
these
headphones
are
insanely
great
for
the
price
totally
worth
every
penny
and
then
some
love
them
better
sound
quality
than
my
higher
priced
ones
the
sound
is
good
and
the
hook
over
the
ear
keeps
them
more
secure
especial
like
that
you
can
see
how
much
charge
is
left
so
far
so
good
they
are
really
good
for
the
price
$35
i've
been
using
for
few
days
now
and
they
are
fantastic
noise
cancellation

great
and
the
sound
quality
while

the
phone
is
also
great
i'm
also
really
happy
with
the
battery

headphones
easy
to
charge
and
wear,
powerful
can
take
every
call
even
in
din
of
noise
i'd
buy
them
again
poor
sound
quality
on
calls,
battery
life
drains
quickly
even
without
use
this
is
solid
product
for
an
affordable
price
very
happy
with
the
sound

and
battery
life
love
the
digital
battery

sync
up
easily
to

would
buy
again
amazing
wireless
earbudshighest
quality
for
the
most
affordable
price
out
of
all
the
others
here
on
amazonthe
packaging
was
the
same
level
of
quality
as
my
samsung
galaxy
watch
no
regrets,
hands
down
great
affordable
set
of
earbuds
perfect
birthday
present
for
my
son,
who
is
super
picky
he
especially
likes
using
these
to
workout
great
sound
quality
when
playing
music
very
easy
to
pair
the
bluetooth
with
my
phone
sound
quality
when
making
calls
was
good
like
the
way
they
stay
in
place
with
size
options
for
the
earpieces
they
came
with
medium
installed
and
struggled
to
keep
them
inserted
switched
to
small
and
they
stay
put
now
use
them
with
my
cell
phone
and
my
laptop
very
handy
could
use
little
more
bass
sometimes
but
great
earbuds
allinall
bought
these
as
gift
for
someone
looking
for
headphones
for
their
daily
walks
we
opened
them
to
test
them
out,
but
haven't
spent
much
time
with
these
they
were
packaged
nicely
charged
easily
and
paired
flawlessly
with
our
laptop
we
anticipate
the
recipient
loving
this
gift
head
phones
easy
to
set
up,
sound
quality
is
great,
battery
life
great
as
well
these
earbuds
are
great,
sound
is
good
and
fit
is
very
good
had
problems
with
my
previous
ones
falling
out
when
was
working
my
work
requires
me
work
in
many
different
positions
and
when
laying
on
my
side
the
others
would
fall
out
but
not
these
very
pleased
with
product
and
seller
came
on
time
and
was
packaged
well
to
prevent
damage
didn't
think
would
end
up
liking
the
earbuds
because
normally
more
of
wired
earbuds
than
wireless
because
don't
want
to
the
earbuds
fall
off
my
ear
and
end
up
losing
them
making
me
to
prefer
wired
but
these
earbuds
are
not
like
the
other
wireless
ones
that
don't
have
that
attachment
that
hang
on
your
ear
and
really
like
these
earbuds
the
headphones
has
great
sound
but
it
randomly
disconnects
from
the
phone
while
you
are
talking
to
people
on
the
phone
sometimes
the
two
will
work
separately
from
each
other
but
overall
it
work
well
sometimes
very
easy
to
pair
with
my
phone
laptoptablet
whatever
ordered
the
occiam
brand
wireless
earbuds,
and
they're
literally
better
than
the
powerbeats
got
on
black
friday
back
in
2018
packaging
was
excellent,
design
is
sleek
and
easy
to
wear
the
charge
lasts
forever
and
the
bass
is
unreal
needed
good
set
for
when
work
out,
and
it's
exactly
what
wanted
highly
recommend
item
sounds
good
and
fits
well
but
the
connection
cuts
in
and
out
everytime,
only
for
second
or
so
but
it
gets
really
annoying
after
an
hour
or
so
great
earbuds
good
bass
and
ranges
overall
battery
held
charge
long
time
good
sound
quality
and
easy
to
connect
to
bluetooth
comfortable
to
wear
during
workouts
so
far
am
very
happy
with
my
purchase
easy
to
use
falls
off
ears
when
running
and
sound
isn't
very
loud
first
impressions
are
awesome
so
far
great
sound
quality
for
good
price
easy
set
up
great
sound
easy
warranty
registration
i've
had
other
bluetooth
earbuds
around
the
same
price
and
they
were
not
the
best
quality
but
was
paying
20
to
30
bucks
so
that
was
understandable,
you
get
what
you
pay
for
but
these
ear
buds
definitely
surprised
me
love
bass
in
my
music
and
these
earbuds
definitely
have
sound
quality
better
than
what
paid
for
them
very
surprised
and
satisfied
fits
well
and
comfortably
in
my
ear
and
doesn
fall
out
very
nice
set
of
headphones
decent
sound
quality
and
easy
to
pair
to
my
samsung
phone
just
started
using
so
haven't
depleted
battery
yet
very
happy
with
purchase
great
quality
amazing
sound
and
definitely
worth

for
me
when

lightweight
bluetooth
headphones
with

and
convenient
charging
case
good
sound
quality
and
noise
cancellation
love
that
these
are
totally
wireless,
unlike
my
older
powerbeats3
responsive
customer
service
definitely
recommend
was
having
trouble
with
ear
buds
staying
in
my
ears
while
running,
but
these
worked
great
pretty
straightforward
earbuds
they
work
with
my
phone
and
computer
very
easy
to
connect
my
friend
heard
me
decently
while
playing
games
definitely
good
deal
these
headphones
are
sleek
and
very
nice
design
they
were
easy
to
pair
to
my
phone
and
worked
instantly
the
sound
was
clear
when
talking
on
the
phone,
but
it
not
as
loud
as
would
like
it
to
be
listening
to
music
is
clear
and
great
sound
my
overall
experience
with
this
product
is
great
not
disappointed
in
any
way
and
for
the
price
think
they
are
total
win
easy
to
use,
comfortable
and
more
important
secure
while
staying
in
your
ear
while
you
re
doing
any
kind
of
activity
happy
to
have
them
and
to
use
them
and
really
impressed
with
the
product
and
the
store
great
battery
life
and
distance
on
these
headphones
would
recommend
have
used
these
headphones
nearly
every
day
since
receiving
them
and
they
are
great
no
problems
so
far
excellent
product
sound
is
excellent
and
it
connects
fast
when
blue
tooth
is
on
also
it
reaches
long
distance
love
these
headphones
they
are
affordable
but
still
good
quality
through
the
headphone
speakers,
and
very
easy
to
use
in
terms
of
charging,
listening
to
music,
phone
calls,
etc
the
sound
quality
is
great,
battery
life
lasts
long
and
the
best
part
is
they
stay
in
place
the
only
thing
that
annoyed
me
was
they
kept
asking
for
proof
of
product
review
in
order
to
get
the
lifetime
warranty
so
if
it
present
you
received
how
the
hell
would
that
work
do
you
ask
the
person
who
gifted
them
for
their
account
info
fits
very
well
the
sound
is
amazing
the
price
can't
be
beaten
husband
loves
these
headphones
sound
is
great
and
they
are
easy
to
use
would,
certainly
buy
again
earbuds
worked
fine
until
had
connection
problem
customer
service
was
excellent
in
replacing
them,
in
timely
matter
sound
is
good,
but
charging
seems
to
be
an
issue
fitting
over
the
ear
these
ear
buds
will
stay
in
place
when
exercising,
even
when
it
hot
and
sweat
the
audio
of
these
headphones
constantly
cuts
out,
the
individual
earbuds
seem
to
desync
often,
and
the
sound
volume
control
isn't
great
don't
recommend
for
working
out
because
earbuds
constantly
fall
out
even
if
you
switch
out
the
rubber
inserts,
the
charging
station
makes
for
an
okay
paper
weight
do
not
buy
the
first
unit
received
had
very
short
battery
life
and
the
led
display
for
one
of
the
earbuds
was
not
working
contacted
occiam
customer
service
they
responded
promptly
and
within
week
received
new
unit
excellent
customer
service,
great
sound
quality
worth
the
price
love
the
over
the
ear
headphones
great
price
the
battery
life
on
the
case
is
non
existing
amd
the
head
phones
is
hours
at
the
most
sound
is
pretty
decent
but
my
issue
is
the
the
battery
life
bought
this
pair
to
wear
while
exercising
and
it
has
been
working
great
so
far
the
sound
quality
is
good
and
they
block
out
background
noises
really
well
they
also
fit
very
comfortably
haven
had
any
problems
with
them
becoming
loose
or
falling
off
would
definitely
buy
again
sounds
is
good
price
is
good
get
about
6hrs
of
use
at
80%
volume
no
complaints
yet
love
these
so
much
got
one
for
my
mom
and
brother
they
are
soft
and
don
hurt
your
ear
my
mom
likes
to
listen
to
books
and
watch
her
kdramas
my
brother
is
gamer
and
talks
on
the
phone
all
day
long
in
both
cases
the
occiam
bluetooth
headphones
are
comfortable
got
this
for
my
mom
as
gift
and
she
loves
it
like
how
there
battery
indicator
and
the
sound
quality
is
good
too
they
are
also
very
comfortable
and
snug
over
the
ears
bought
these
because
of
the
good
reviews
and
affordability,
glad
did
quality
sound
with
comfort
over
decent
time,
small
on
the
ear
and
wont
slip
off
thus
far
enjoy
this
for
its
rather
modest
price
tag
after
using
for
about
month
it
is
really
nice
to
use
quick
an
easy,
aside
from
the
magnets
not
being
strong
enough
to
keep
close
when
it[case]
falls
off
table
or
similar
but
overall
highly
recommend
these
fantastic
sound
noise
cancelation
is
amazing
great
build
quality
case
fits
comfortably
in
my
pocket
great
volume
and
sound
quality
so
far
i've
only
had
this
pair
for
one
day
so
can't
say
how
well
they
will
last
they
fit
well
and
the
sound
quality
is
very
good
am
not
completely
sure
about
the
battery
life
as
haven
used
them
long
enough
to
run
down
the
battery
they
are
comfortable
and
seem
to
cancel
noise
pretty
well
as
they
are
not
really
noise
cancelling
mainly
use
them
when
ride
my
motorcycle
so
far,
so
good
much
better
than
my
skullcandy
decent
product
but
constantly
have
to
clean
connections
right
one
only
lasts
about
40
while
the
left
one
we'll
go
hours
kept
them
in
my
pocket
while
working
out
and
they
don't
charge
properly
they
are
comfortable
don't
irritate
my
ears
at
first
was
just
trying
an
ear
bud
with
different
style
but
am
pleasantly
surprised
it
has
exceeded
my
expectations
it
is
comfortable
on
the
ear,
has
great
loudness
and
good
battery
life
you
will
have
no
issues
with
these
good
buy
have
not
used
the
headphones
except
to
try
them
out
they
seem
really
good
there
customer
service
is
amazing
they
got
back
to
me
so
quickly
so
would
give
them
five
star
simply
for
there
customer
service
these
bluetooth
earphones
are
just
what
wanted
great
sound
of
my
musicphone
call
clarityso

weargreat
for
my
power
walking
headphones

be
of
great
quality
customer

great
and
helpful
cool
little
bluetooth
ear
buds
seem
great
so
far
just
got
these
earphones
and
so
far
they
are
working
great
use
them
with
my
phone
pairing
was
easy,
and
the
battery
life
so
far
is
goodwill
update
this
in
month
or
two
if
anything

awesome
sound
quality,
great
value,
quick
delivery,
and
good
battery

far
noise
cancelling
is
good,
can
still
hear
little
but
still
great
for
running
and
outside
or
my
office
has
great
grip
and
doesn't
slip
out
during
running
or
anything
got
it
for
present
and
my
son
loves
itand
the
price
is
good
they
sound
great
and
won
1st
prize
on
the
scratch
off
love
they
are
waterproof
so
can
listen
to
my
podcast
in
the
shower
lol
charge
as
well
inside
the
case
sound
quality
is
good
great
set
at
great
price,
had
small
issue
with
the
volume
at
first
chatted
with
costumer
service
and
was
helped
out
with
the
issue,
they
work
perfectly
and
you
can
beat
the
price
reading
the
rest
of
these
reviews,
maybe
got
dud
but
these
were
unreliable
and
unusable
constantly
unpairing
and
pairing
then
turning
off
and
on
at
random
while
in
use
often
had
to
stop
and
remove
them
as
the
left
earbud
repeating,
powering
on
over
and
over
and
over
and
over
and
over
again
don't
usually
go
for
bluetooth
earbuds
with
hook
because
they're
often
uncomfortable
for
me
but
wore
these
for
few
hours
and
my
ears
felt
fine
the
sound
cancellation
also
works
very
well
and
sound
quality
comes
out
pretty
clear
too
it
connects
to
my
pc
and
phone
both
without
any
problems
the
over
the
ear
hook
works
well
on
these
and
prevents
them
from
falling
off
the
travel
case
is
cool
because
it
shows
you
how
much
battery
is
left
headphones
paired
immediately
to
ipad
and
has
good
range
great
product,
easy
to
connect,
fits
really
well
to
the
ears,
very
comfortable,
good
sound
&
good
battery
life
very
happy
with
the
wireless
earbuds
easy
setup
and
connection,
also
like
the
charging
setup
price
is
great
:
these
earbuds
have
the
best
sound
i've
heard
out
of
all
the
ones
i've
used
and
had
always
have
an
issue
with
earbuds
actually
staying
in
my
ears
but
these
ones
stay
in
so
amazingly
and
are
so
comfortable
i'm
really
truly
grateful
to
have
found
these
not
impressed
sound
buttons
wouldn't
adjust
the
sound
the
bass
is
mediocre
at
best
does
not
connect
to
fitbit
ionic
if
you
don't
want
to
spend
lot
of
money
go
for
it
if
you
want
quality
product
fork
out
the
extra
thirty
dollars
so
you
don't
waste
your
time
now
have
an
extra
errand
to
run
and
garbage
headphones
thanks
the
fit
my
ears
perfectly
and
battery
life
have
tried
these
headphones
for
over
week
to
teach
some
zoom
yoga
classes
for
my
business
and
they
are
not
working
out
at
all
students
tell
me
much
of
the
time
they
can
hear
me
and
if
they
do
hear
me
sometimes
its
static,
no
clear
am
very
disappointed
and
will
be
returning
this
product
great
product
fits
my
ears
perfect
and
sounds
great
purchased
the
occiam
bluetooth
headphones
because
wanted
something
could
place
over
my
ears
during
workouts
other
earbuds
simply
fell
out
anytime
did
anything
these
headphones
fit
nicely
over
the
ear
and
stay
on
when
run
or
lift
have
no
issues
with
sound
quality
and
they
do
what
want
them
to
do
these
are
exactly
what
needed
they
stay
put
have
different
size
for
ears
great
little
case
it's
not
bose
but
for
the
price,
it
sounds
good,
is
comfortable,
and
worth
the
money
just
had
it
few
days,
so
don't
know
yet
about
battery
life
the
over
ear
piece
is
big
plus
for
active
people
it's
very
secure
great
sound
quality
,
without
the
big
price
tag
these
headphones
are
amazing
ve
bought
othe
headphones
for
twice
this
price
and
these
are
10x
better
ve
used
for
about
week
straight
now
and
the
sound
is
great
and
the
noise
canceling
is
great
they
fit
comfortably
in
my
ears
and
no
issues
at
all
when
run
and
sweat
lot
will
definitely
buy
couple
more
for
family
this
is
great
product
with
reasonable
price
they
are
pretty
comfortable
to
wear
with
rubber
bands
also
like
the
quality
of
the
sound
the
range
of
the
bluetooth
connection
works
farther
than
expected
overall,
am
satisfied
with
the
most
of
its
function
used
it
for
jogging
twice
so
far,
the
bass
is
definitely
an
improvement
from
my
older
anker
bluetooth
headset
was
also
worried
that
the
earphones
would
bounce
around
and
come
out
since
i've
had
that
with
some
previous
headphones,
but
so
far
so
good
they
stay
in
snug
and
fit
bought
these
for
my
son,
who
decided
he
needed
bigger
ones
for
gaming
decided
to
keep
and
use
nice
quality
and
like
that
they
go
over
the
ear,
rather
than
falling
out
like
my
old
earbud
that
just
go
in
the
ear
would
definitely
buy
again
have
purchase
other
ear
buds
before
and
these
are
by
far
the
best
the
sound
is
excellent
used
them
while
on
the
phone
today
and
my
friend
said
that
it
sounded
like
was
talking
to
her
face
to
face
excellent
quality
extremely
satisfied
just
got
these
they
are
awesome
like
that
was
able
to
pair
them
easily
with
my
devices
instead
of
asking
my
daughter
there
is
also
online
support
for
help
the
sound
is
very
clear
also
find
them
comfortable
to

when
am
talking
on
the
phone
great
price,
excellent
performance
great
buy
excellent
product
great
sound
quality
the
headphones
work
better
than
talking
directly
into
my
phone
love
earloops
to
keep
buds
from
falling
out
during
walking,
running,
etc
battery
does
not
charge
evenly
on
both
sides
one
side
is
full
and
the
other
is
barely
charged
great
product
for
price
great
case
light
for
using
with
wheeler
with
helmet
just
what
need
love
these
headphones
charge
fast
and
sounds
great
great
quality,
easy
to
setup
and
use
the
charging
port
broke
on
my
last
wireless
buds
because
of
excessive
insertion/removal
of
the
usb
this
system
with
the
charging
contacts
on
the
buds
and
the
charging
pins
inside
the
charging
case
won
wear
out
like
it
did
on
my
old
pods
otherwise
good
battery
life,
sound
volume/bass,
and
the
automatic
pairing
is
great
awesome
headphones
like
ones
that
wrap
around
the
ear
so
these
are
perfect
super
loud
and
clear
battery
life
lasts
long
time
returned
because
the
device
consumed
the
battery
when
in
the
case
and
not
in
use
so
had
to
charge
all
the
time
what
is
the
point
the
sound
quality
is
great
and
love
the
battery
charger
it
makes
it
easy
to
store
and
charge
the
headphones
at
one
time
gave
these
as
gift,
also
for
nicely
haven
found
anything
to
dislike
delivered
quickly
and
fits
in
ears
perfectly
this
is
not
noise
cancelling
earbuds
so
don
expect
it
good
price
for
what
it
does
product
is
working
great
so
far
only
had
it
day
though
excellent
customer
service
emails
are
answered
well
within
the
established
timeframe
and
occiam
customer
service
asks
pointed
questions
to
ensure
they
are
solving
your
specific
problem
was
offered
various
options

bought
these
for
my
daughter's
school
work
the
battery
life
is
"ok",
but
i'm
hoping

is
just
because

fully
charged

than
that,
she

good
wearing
them,
and
they
actually
fit
her

the

really
awesome3
digitally
it
shows
the
battery

that
helps
know
exactly
how
much
juice
is
available
was
skeptical,
but
when
heard
the
quality
of
my
music
on
them,
was
impressed
nice
full
sound,
not
tinny
or
weakand
only
had
the
volume
up
halfway
then

is
one
of

out
everything
and
everybody
super
easy
to
pair
up
with
any
of
your

bought
these
for
my
daughter
for
christmas
and
she
loves
them
tried
them
out
myself
to
listen
to
podcast

was
very

excellent

quality
got
these
for
my
moms
and
they
loved
them
they
paired
easily
these
wireless
earbuds
were
great,
5/5,
until
the
right
earbud
stopped
working
barely
month
after
getting
them,
with
only
light
use
sound
will
pop
in
and
out
occasionally,
but
mostly
that
earbud
just
doesn't
play
sound
can't
use
them
anymore
because
of
this,
both
need
to
work
obviously
will
be
returning
these

husband
so
far,
he
has
no
complaints

only
small
thing
is
there
is
small
"whine"
that
comes
from
the
box
when
it's
plugged
in
with
the
headphones
inside

wireless
earbuds
watching
tv
silently
easy
to
use
and
good
quality
better
range
than
other
wireless
ear
buds
have
tried
was
playing
basketball
and
running
stairs
in
the
gym
and
they
stayed
connected
with
no
trouble
from
one
side
of
the
gym
to
the
other,
which
was
over
100
feet
so
far
so
good
only
tried
them
for
day
or
so
only
time
will
really
tell,
but
it
came
quick,
clean
packaging,
hard
case
for
carrying
them
in
bag
or
pocket
vs
the
soft
one
usually
getthat's
good
thing
protects
them
betterand
they
work
as
intended
thanks
alot
very
comfortable,
and
good
sound
quality
would
definitely
recommend
like
the
fit
and
the
sound
got
my
sister
set
for
her
small
ear
canals
these
stay
in
so
she
can
enjoy
her
music
got
these
yesterday
very
easy
to
setup
and
sound
quality
is
far
better
then
the
ones
that
came
with
my
s20
like
them
so
much
after
days
use
ordered
set
for
my
wife
for
forty
dollars
you
can't
really
go
wrong
attractive,
easy
to
setup
and
great
sound
sound
is
excellent
and
noise
cancellation
actually
works
am
very
impressed
with
the
quality
of
the
headphones,
being
that
they
are
at
such
bargain
price
they
are
comfortable
and
don't
budge
when
workout
with
them,
too
great
if
you
are
in
search
for
some
budget

appreciate
the
solid
of
the
outer
shell
case,
that
stores
and
keeps
the
twins
earbuds
charged
up
the
sound
is
great
and
the
wrap
around
ear
piece
is
nice
and
soft
had
other
ear
pieces
and
they
would
work
their
way
out
when
talking
or
eating
constantly
having
to
push
back
into
ear
and
often
accidentally
hanging
up
don't
think
these
are
going
anywhere

battery
life
works
well
for

bt

ok
but
not
great
easy

works
perfectly
right
out
of
the

excellent
sound
quality
and
very
comfortable
to
wear
easy
to
use
and
when
used
it
for
conference
calls,
people
said
it
worked
fine
and
no
complaints
ordered
these
for
my
so,
he
runner
and
has
killed
multiple
other
brands
bluetooth
earbuds
via
sweat
he
absolutely
loved
these,
said
they
re
the
best
sounding
and
feeling
ones
he
had,
they
cancel
noise
better
than
actual
noise
cancelling
ones
&
theres
no

occiam
bluetooth
headphones
earbuds
work
well
and
produce
an
excellent
sound
quality
due
to
the
comfortable
fit
without
falling
off
for
my
sport
and
regular
activity
love
it
so
far
everything
has
been
fine
with
them
they
were
supposed
to
be
christmas
present
to
myself
but
couldn't
wait
to
use
them
bought
others
model
headphones
and
wish
would
have
purchased
just
these
charging
case
is
so
much
nicer
than
the
other
ear
buds
these
were
christmas
gift
to
my
grandson
he
said
they
were
very
comfortablehe
has
not
used
them
enuf
to
know
about
the
batteriesi
can't
get
photo
of
himhe
received
the
ones
that
go
around
the
ears
works
great
the
sound
quality
is
on
par
with
earbuds
that
cost
4x
as
much,
and
in
the
end
the
quality
is
superior
since
their
design
keeps
them
from
shifting
and
leading
to
breaks/changes
in
the
audio
great
with
my
tablet
or
phone
not
sure
about
battery
life
yet
as
they
are
new
but
the
initial
charging
was
quick
they
are
very
comfortable
and
easy
to
use
headphones
provides
great
sound
and
fits
firmly
in
your
ear
so
you
have
no
restrictions
when
moving
around
or
exercising
very
easy
to
use
and
comfortable
to
to
use

quality
is
good
noise

is
good
also
have
to
wait
for

bluetooth
headphone
the
sound
clearthank
you
have
been
looking
for
decent
pair
of
bluetooth
headphones
that
were
not
ear
plugs,
but
wrapped
around
my
ears
these
fit
the
budget
and
give
me
great
sound
volume
and
drowns
out
the
noise
of
my
work
environment
needed
wireless
earbuds
for
when
do
my
daily
runs,
and
ve
always
had
the
issue
of
the
headphones
falling
out
while
am
exercising
am
so
glad
found
this
product,
because
they
fit
perfectly
in
my
ears
the
sound
quality
and
battery
life
is
great
too

too
totally
recommend
it
disclaimer:
the
warranty
requires
review
these
have
been
by
far
my
favorite
headphones
great
sound
noise
cancelling
is
better
than
others
they
stay
on
your
ears
and
are
comfortable
and
the
fact
you
can
use
both
or
just
one
of
the
earbuds
very
good
sound
quality
love
these
for
the
price
they
sound
decent
easy
to
pair
and
play
great
volume
and
sound
really
like
the
battery
displays
to
take
the
guesswork
out
of
know
what
the
charge
levels
are
purchased
these
because
airpods
don't
fit
my
ears
well
they
always
fall
out
these
headphones
were
good
investment
and
work
well
they're
not
noise
cancelling,
but
retain
their
charge
and
i've
never
had
difficulty
pairing
them
with
my
macbook
or
iphone
good
quality
it
pretty
good
for
the
price
and
sound
quality
is
decent
too
good
sound
purchased
for
workouts
but
use
for
all
purposes
excellent
sound,
comfortable,
well
designed
very
pleased
with
purchase
no
issues
they
are
comfortable
and
have
good
sound
finally,
bluetooth
headphones
that
can
ear
clear
and
loud
easy
to
charge,
like
the
sizes
of
ear
buds
that
came
with
it
so
could
find
one
that
fit
my
ears
no
issues
pairing
to
device,
however
it
doesn't
seem
to
pair
to
multiple
devices
at
once
this
means
have
to
manually
disconnect
one
device
to
pair
different
device
"these
ear
buds
are
fantastic
so
many
different
features
that
was
not
even
aware
of
really
like
the
fact
fact
that
you
can
use
one
speaker
at
time
as
wireless
blue
tooth
for
my
iphone
also
love
the
charging
case
great
product"
if
you
sweat
while
wearing
these
they
seem
to
react
as
if
theyve
been
put
in
the
case,
so
the
contact
pins
face
the
skin
and
if
you
sweat
much
they
won't
work
very
good
product,
liked
how
long
the
battery
lasts
and
they
are
very
comfortable
inconsistent
quality,
does
not
stay
charged
as
advertised
customer
service
promised
to
send
another
pair
for
free
but
only
if
gave
them
high
rating
etc
would
never
buy
again
from
this
seller
what
like
most
is
the
fit,
they
fit
really
well
when
working
out
the
quality
of
sound
is
excellent
all
things
considered
for
this
price
point,
it's
an
incredible
set
of
earbuds
i've
had
the
really
expensive
$200
price
earbuds
and
not
even
close
to
the
quality
they're
great
searched
every
bluetooth
ear
buds
on
amazon,
and
think
made
great
choice
too
cold
to
try
them
outside
running/walking
but
comfortable
so
far
fits
my
ears
comfortably
even
with
my
glasses
on
it
was
my
impression
that
the
sound
quality
would
be
similar
to
at
least
cheap
headphones,
but
there
very
little
bass
even
though
they
are
very
clear
for
talking
an
ok
product,
works
without
fuss
for
the
headphones
to
be
so
small,
the
sound
is
very
impactful
enjoyed
listening
to
music
and
when
sweating,
it
doesn
slide
off
of
my
ear,
which
ve
had
problems
like
that
with
other
headphones
ve
used
in
the
past
some
of
the
best
headphones
i've
ever
used
the
sound
quality
is
great
they
fit
my
ears
and
stay
in
well,
and
so
far
they
have
been
very
sweat
and
heat
resistant
would
definitely
purchase
these
again
don't
think
you'll
find
any
better
for
the
price
very
good
quality
great
sound
great
headphones
ve
tried
different
earbud
style
but
after
bit
they
fall
out
when
you
move
or
workout
these
stay
pretty
tight
to
the
ear,
best
ones
ve
found
so
far

with
90%
charge

paired
so

but
the
best
thing

they
do
stay

is
perfect
the

go
able

workout
properly
because
these

that
remains
is
to

the
battery
life
when
in
continuous
use
the
sound
quality
is
quite
good,
and
the
mic
is
exemplary
use
it
to
make
calls,
and
it
works
famously
also
love
the
overear
thing;
feels
more
secure
than
just
an
earbud
very
much
worth
the
money
bought
another
one
coz
lost
one
piecelove
it
tried
other
products,
returned
as
soon
as
see
their
ugly
design
so
reordered
this
one
comfortable
and
good
quality
love
them
excellent
fit
these
headphones
are
working
great
have
great
fit
for
my
ears
sound
great
very
portable
great
love
the
earbudsthey
have
great
quality
feel
and
the
packaging
is
top
notch
they
sound
great
and
like
that
they
can
work
independent
of
each
other
excellent
for
sharing
with
my
husband
when
watching
movie
on
plane
etc
does
the
job
the
sound
quality
is
excellent
love
that
the
wraparound
the
ear
these
wireless
headphones
are
really
nice,
and
like
that
they
stay
on
your
ear
when
you
are
working
out
or
just
simply
watching
video
on
your
phone
the
sound
quality
is
good
for
the
price
and
the
battery
lasts
fairly
long
to
what
expected
works
very
well,
long
lasting
charge,
and
fits
snugly
just
received
product
very
comfortable
fit
really
great
headphone
for
the
cost
they
stay
put
ptetty
well
my
only
complaint
would
be
the
arm
that
wraps
around
the
ear
is
bit
large
good
phones
good
sound
quality,
sleek
design,
so
far
battery
life
is
good
good
noise
cancelling
great
product,
great
price
ordered
these
to
take
on
my
walk
in
the
park
didn't
want
to
risk
losing
them
so
am
happy
that
they
wrap
around
the
ears
have
used
them
twice
and
am
glad
that
made
this
choice
battery
life
is
what
matters
when
you
are
using
any
battery
operated
device,
so
this
is
very
good
and
the
with
noise
cancellation
makes
it
even
bertter
sound
quality
matters
too,
and
this
has
it,
excellant
quality
love
how
it
shows
battery
life
for
both
the
headphones
and
the
case
these
buds
work
as
stated
right
out
of
the
boxgood
to
excellent
sound
quality
wish
they
had
multipoint
pairing
would
be
willing
to
pay
more
was
worried
that
these
headphones
would
become
uncomfortable
after
using
them
for
long
time
but
no,
they
are
very
comfortable,
just
as
other
users
told
me
:3
have
no
complaints
with
the
sound
as
it
is
excellent
and
neither
with
the
battery
performance
:
love
them
so
far
but
still
early
yet
easily
paired
comfortable
on
ears
not
the
best
sound
quality,
but
it's
goodgood
range,
great
battery
lifepros:
cheap,
functional,
good
music
qualitycons:
music
quality
not
great,
over
ear
hook
can
slip
off
during
workouts
thought
these
were
for
working
out
the
moment
start
to
sweat
even
the
smallest
bit
they
seem
to
quit
working
they
either
work
one
at
time
sporadically
switching
back
and
forth
or
disconnect
altogether
it
is
extremely
frustrating
and
can
not
use
them
for
anything
at
this
point
wore
them
on
motorcycle
ride
and
enjoyed
them
bought
pairs
of
these
headsets
for
gifts
volume
control
on
the
headset
does
not
work
at
all
on
all
of
them
this
product
is
trash
they're
great
great
for
the
price,
love
the
charging
case
horrible
though
it
paired
easily
enough,
on
three
different
devices
the
right
earbud
kept
disconnecting
from
the
left,
causing
the
volume
to
drop
out
continuously
impossible
to
listen
to
anything
i'll
be
sending
these
back,
as
they
don't
work
as
intended
great
product
love
it
so
much
sounds
great
&
batteries
last
great
works
great
with
my
fire
tv
the
warranty
seems
impossible
to
beat,
but
the
sound
quality
is
mediocre
at
best
got
these
so
could
listen
to
music/podcasts/audio
books
at
work,
and
they're
fantastic
having
the
ability
to
have
one
ear
bud
in
while
the
other
charges
is
great,
but
i've
never
really
had
to
worry
about
it
as
each
ear
bud
can
go
about
ten
hours
on
its
own
great
buy
amazing
pair
very
comfortable
to
wear
and
use
charge
capabilities
are
very
good
charging
case
is
lightweight
and
very
easy
to
handle
digital
display
inside
the
case
is
nice
touchonly
disadvantage
personally
feel
is
the
maximum
sound
could
be
little
higher
great
charge
life
sound
quality
is
good
my
ear
does
get
little
sore
after
long
hours
of
wearing
the
buds
but
that's
more
on
me
not
resting
than
on
the
buds
themselves
love
the
quality
of
these
headphones
the
battery
life
is
much
longer
than
my
older
pair
and
they
are
great
for
my
workouts
works
well
with
my
samsung
tv
they
sound
great
very
happy
with
them
so
far
my
husband
got
them
for
me
for
christmas
walk/run
daily
and
needed
an
earbud
set
that
would
not
fall
out
of
my
ears
these
satisfy
that
need
also
like
the
remaining
power
indicators
this
is
huge
plus
they
fit
great
on
my
ears
and
don
fall
out
during
movement
very
slick
design
with
an
awesome
noise
cancellation
functionlong
lasting
battery
help
stay
tuned
on
media
great
product,
on
time
delivery,
easy
to
use
product
came
quick
and
better
than
expected
these
are
by
far
the
best
wireless
headphones
i've
owned
the
sound
is
very
clear
and
does
not
fall
out
of
my
ears
i'd
recommend
these
to
others
the
sound
quality
is
great,
they
are
comfortable
in
my
ears
like
that
don't
have
to
use
both
earbuds
when
on
the
phone
low
cost,
fast
delivery
and
fast
customer
service
if
needed
use
it
primarily
for
my
phone
and
convenience
of
using
each
ear
piece
independently
is
plus
battery
case
is
lite
and
compact
like
it
shows
the
percentage
of
battery
sound
quality
is
top
notch
with
great
bass
most
importantly
the
price
is
just
one
fifth
of
big
names
headphones
highly
recommended
noise
cancelling
is
great,
they
stay
snug
in
place
and
sounds
quality
is
great
great
battery
life,
especially
since
only
generally
use
one
earbud
at
time
excellent
for
the
price
and
qualityso
far
good
purchase,
awesome
sound,
easy
pairing,
great
quality
great
have
tried
many
types
of
headphones,
but
these
are
the
clearest
sounding
i've
owned,
and
the
clarity
of
phone
conversations
is
miles
ahead
of
other
headphones
highly
recommended
so
for
all
functions
work
they
fit
and
feel
ok
in
my
ears
can
hear
everyone
clearly
and
they
can
hear
me
can
hear
my
music
and
tv
shows
used
them
for
hours
and
then
left
them
off
the
charger
for
the
night
woke
up
this
morning
and
they
still
have
lifr
left
just
amazing
great
bluetooth
headset
these
earbuds
look
good
and
are
comfortable
sound
quality
is
respectable
but
the
user
interface
isn't
correct
for
rookie
like
me
gave
them
to
my
wife
for
christmas
they
paired
easily
to
her
phone
she
likes
how
she
can
turn
off
the
sound
by
pressing
the
button
if
she
wants
to
talk
to
someone
great
sound,
quick
and
easy
setup
and
bluetooth
connection
sounds
better
than
my
previous
much
more
expensive
ear
buds
sound
quality
is
great,
battery
is
great,
love
the
fit
awesome
product,
great
price
solid
buy
product
fits
the
ear
well
and
has
number
of
options
as
to
eat
bud
size
sound
quality
is
great
only
just
received
them
so
we
will
see
how
well
the
battery
life
goes
thus
far
am
happy
with
the
purchase
was
very
pleased
with
the
sound
quality,
the
range
of
the
bluetooth,
and
the
quality
of
the
earphones
themselves
would
order
these
again
like
the
fact
that
could
put
it
on
my
ear
very
quickly
battery
life
very
long
listen
to

and
this
really
sounds

video
my
wife
and
love
these
headphones
,
received
pair
as
gift
and
then
ordered
my
own
pair
use
them
at
work
every
day
to
listen
to
music
great
battery
life
and
awesome
quality
for
the
money
these
work
great
they
are
the
best
value
for
the
price,
and
there
is
good
battery
life
in
the
headphones
and
the
case
the
sound
quality
is
also
great
the
product
has
very
good
feel
when
you
are
wearing
it
love
them
should
really
call
myself
to
hear
what
they
sound
like,
but
so
far
the
people
i've
spoken
to
have
said
my
voice
sounds
clear
and
really
like
the
fact
that
can
use
them
independently
of
each
other,
in
case
lose
one
or
break
one
just
got
these
and
so
far
they
are
very
comfortable
and
feel
secure
the
sound
is
also
great
and
the
calls
are
clear
bought
these
for
calls
and
was
told
that
sounded
great
and
there
is
no
feedback
love
love
love
these
they
are
awesome
now
can
block
my
daughter
because
she
will
talk
as
long
as
she
awake
they
have
lot
of
base
and
are
super
loud
sounds
good
so
far
wish
the
ear
flanges
were
adjustable
hopefully
they
stay
in
better
at
work
than
the
type
without
the
flanges
love
my
wireless
earphones
sound
quality
is
great
love
that
they
don
fall
off
and
they
charge
inside
their
case
buy
them
left
headphone
doesn't
work
anymore
turns
on,
connects
just
fine
and
can
even
pause
and
play
my
music
but
no
sound
comes
out
connect
exactly
as
described
and
work
perfectly
the
noise
cancelling
is
excellent
use
these
wireless
headphones
while
on
the
move
at
work
and
they
are
amazing
no
problems
with
them
falling
out
since
they
fit
comfortably
in
ear
the
battery
on
single
bud
lasts
me
about
hours
before
having
to
put
it
in
the
case
to
charge
again
recommend
100%
work
great
and
delivered
early
the
wireless
earbuds
have
very
good
quality
sound
the
noise
canceling
is
very
nice
feature
and
works
well
have
not
had
chance
to
fully
check
out
the
battery
life
as
they
ve
lasted
plenty
long
for
what
have
done
worked
ok
for
less
then
months,
of
headphones
doesn't
produce
sound
nowover
ear
rims
are
not
well
designed
,
didn't
fit
great
and
created
pressure
behind
ears
after
an
hour,
and
fell
off
while
moving
around
from
time
to
time
love
them
sounds
good
and
people
can
hear
me
good
am
in
love
with
these
waited
to
post
the
review
to
be
able

and
gifting
these
for
yeas
to
come
product
very
nice
quick
shipping
and
sound
quality
excellent
na
wonderful
i'm
so
excited
to
use
this
for
work
work
out
of
my
home
and
have
been
tethered
to
my
phone
am
so
impressed
with
the
ease
of
pairing
and
the
clarity
of
the
sound
the
100
plus
hours
you
get
is
amazing
and
so
very
easy
to
charge
it
lasts
the
whole
day
listening
to
music
with
the
hr
battery
charge
and
with
the
noise
cancelation
you
don't
have
any
interruption
of
what
you
are
hearing
they
are
very
comfortable
too
these
are
great
quality
wireless
headset
for
affordable
price
love
that
have
the
option
of
using
both
or
headset
the
bass
is
incredible
and
battery
power
is
still
59%
after
days
of
not
charging
like
everything
including
the
case
it
comes
in
to
charge
like
how
they
turn
off
when
you
cut
them
back
on
the
case
as
well
have
tried
many
many
earbuds
as
am
always
on
the
phone
or
listening
to
music
during
activity
these
are
great
sound
and
very
comfortable
highly
recommend
great
for
the
price
they
sound
great
and
haven't
had
any
problems
with
them
disconnecting
from
my
phone
they
charge
very
quickly
very
happy
with
this
product
these
are
lightweight,
hardly
know
you
have
them
one
great
stereo
sound
really
like
the
feature
that
you
can
see
how
much
charge
is
on
storage
box
and
how
much
is
on
headsets
this
is
great
gift
idea
for
people
who
drive
alot
wear
these
mostly
at
work
and
doing
yard
work
they're
very
sturdy,
comfortable,
and
overall
great
value
great
battery
life
too
work
an
entire
hour
shift
before
the
battery
is
low
it
great
for
the
price
the
device
can
hurt
your
ears
if
worn
by
several
hours
with
glasses
and
facemask
and
the
microphone
is
really
bad,
you
can
make
what
say
but
since
everything
has
an
option
to
use
different
microphone
don
consider
this
an
lssue
this
product
is
everything
imagined
and
more
won
the
first
prize
on
the
scratch
card
coupon
that
was
included
in
the
package
true
to
their
word
the
seller
sent
me
my
reward
which
was
equally
of
good
qualityi
recommend
this
to
everyone
really
like
the
noise
canceling
and
battery
life
of
this
product
was
able
to
use
this
product
for
days
of
hour
use
before
having
to
recharge
design
of
the
product
horrible
battery
life
you
basically
need
to
keep
the
charging
case
plugged
into
the
wall
at
all
times
the
case
will
not
hold
charge
and
its
battery
will
drain
from
100%
to
0%
in
matter
of
hours
even
if
not
being
used
bought
these
for
my
husband
who
is
truck
driver
he
loves
them
says
they
are
comfortable,
work
great
and
the
battery
life
is
fantastic
el
producto
es
de
buena
calidad,
facil
manejo
se
escucha
bien
excepto,
que
se
escucha
mucho
el
ruido
exterior
por
ahora,
creo
que
es
lo
único
negativo
que
tiene
it's
good,
but
you
can
hear
lot
of
outside
noise
sound
quality
is
superb
along
with
the
bass
should
have
ordered
these
long
time
ago
this
is
great
product
bought
this
one
for
my
husband
who
likes
to
dance
we
tried
some
other
products
but
they
are
not
stable
enough
to
stay
ok
ear
while
danicing
this
one
is
perfect
got
these
for
gift,
big
improvement
over
the
earbuds
they
were
using
before
they
don't
fall
out
of
their
ears,
and
between
being
able
to
only
use
one
at
time
and
being
able
to
charge
from
the
case
they
can
have
well
over
full
day's
charge
n/c
very
convenient
earphone,
does
not
drop
in
the
movement,
the
sound
quality
is
also
very
good
and
the
endurance
is
very
strong
these
were
pretty
decent
headphones
when
first
got
them
and
are
great
at
staying
in
place
while
working
or
in
the
gym
now
the
left
side
no
longer
works
and
the
sound
from
right
is
not
as
great
really
liked
the
headphones
if
they
would
have
stayed
working
well
great
product
for
the
price
great
bluetooth
ear
buds
excellent
sound
quality
good
noise
canceling
bluetooth
has
about
100
ft
range
battery
life
last
between
to
hours
on
buds
and
case
will
charge
fast
and
gives
you
about
complete
charges
would
definitely
buy
again
it
good
clear
sound
and
the
battery
last
long
very
comfortable
to
wear
and
great
sound
love
the
sound
quality
for
the
price
range
is
excellent
these
are
great
earbuds
always
have
trouble
with
the
buds
staying
in
and
with
this
design
that
hasn
been
problem
can
move
around
and
they
stay
in
place
the
sound
quality
is
great
for
the
price
point
highly
recommend
love
the
hooks
around
top
of
ear
solved
problem
of
buds
falling
out
when
bend
over
had
to
return
it
back
because
one
of
the
ear
buds
did
not
work
and
it
did
not
charge
these
things
are
great
got
these
because
had
to
buy
new
headphone
so
decided
didn't
want
them
with
wire,
so
got
these
and
they
are
awesome
i've
never
owned
pair
of
headphones
like
these
they
sound
good
&
noise
cancelling
so
far
so
good
paired
without
hitch
good
audio
and
voice
looks
like
the
previous
reviews
were
impeccable
quite
pleased
great
sound

use
alone
and
still
hear
the
music
my
last
pair
did
not
work
separately
some
of
the
best
earphones
ever
had
the
bass
is
probably
my
favorite
part
sound

and

am
very
happy
with
this
product
used
few
bluetooth
phones
and
this

is
the
most
confortable
really
like
the
sound
quality,
noise
cancelation
is
great,
and
have
not
charged
it
yet
and
been
using
lot,
so
battery
life
is
not
bad
easy
to
use
and
set
up
bought
these
for
work
and
they
have
been
excellent
actually
prefer
them
over
the
ipods
due
to
the
ear
piece
love
the
fit,
they
stay
in
my
ear
all
the
time
would
give
all
stars
but
charging
case
stopped
working
after
week
of
having
them
tried
contacting
seller
on
11/18/20
still
no
answer
as
of
12/7/20
ear
pods
weregreat
but
can't
use
nowbecause
no
other
way
to
charge
them
sound
quality
is
great
works
great
with
my
iphone
and
like
the
over
the
ear
fit
sound
quality
was
ok,
battery
life
is
very
little
the
worst
thing
was
the
left
earbud
won't
connect,
got
these
as
gift
and
the
left
earbud
will
not
connect
tried
multiple
work
around
and
nothing
helped
don't
recommend
tried
using
these
for
running,
but
they
inconsistently
keep
cutting
out
about
minutes
so
annoying
battery
life
is
really
bad,
and
there
is
not
much
sound
for
the
higher
treble
or
mid
ranges
poor
choice,
keep
looking
comfortable
and
easy
to
set
up
love
this
because
only
can
hear
what's
playing
its
sound
prooft
and
very
easy
to
use
would
recommend
this
to
my
friends
and
family
keep
producing
great
product
at
reasonable
price
for
your
customers
great
sound,
bass
and
overall
quality
at
reasonable
pricei
like
charging
indicator
and
the
ease
of
pairing
and
use
the
earphones
do
not
fall
out,
which
is
great
selling
pointsatisfied
with
my
purchase
and
would
buy
again
was
trying
to
find
earbuds
mainly
for
talking
but
comfortable,
these
worked
perfectly
sound
quality
is
great,
especially
when
listening
to
music
the
fit
is
perfect
fir
my
ears
would
purchase
and
again
and
highly
recommend
this
product
great
sound
nice
sound
quality
and
battery,
but
when
listening
the
sound
would
go
in
and
out
of
each
ear
bud
every
1030
seconds,
very
annoying
great
value
high
quality
for
the
price
el

ligero
muy
cómodo
me
gusta
lo
recomiendo
the
only
time
used
these
was
in
mono
headphone
mode
and
after
hours
the
right
side
died
while
was
on
an
important
call
after
it
died,
it
never
recharged
properly
this
product
is
waste
of
money
and
time
and
would
never
recommend
it
to
anyone
they're
great
and
perfect
for
the
price
the
case
does
feel
bit
weak,
but
hold
up
nicely
only
complaint
is
that
they
will
sometimes
automatically
turn
on
when
in
the
case
and
very
slowly
chee
threw
battery
otherwise,
like
them
lot
great
set
of

the
reason
for
my
review

only
complaint

people
cannot
hear
me
very
well
when
on
the
phone
using
the
ear
buds
have
to
be
in
completely
quiet
environment
the
earbuds
are
nice,
but
really
like
the
charging
case
well,
the
fact
the
case

is
pretty
cool,
but
it's

nice
to
have

great
product
got
them
for

stay
strong
for
short
while
before

they
sound
pretty
good
so
far
like
the

very
small

and
other
wireless
earphones
popped
out
especially
when
it's
cold
highly

and
the

favorite
part
is
the
ability
to
have
one
bud
at
time
out
of
the

so
many
have
tried
require
you

end
made
it
easier
to
wear
for
those
of
us
with
different
wear
sizes
love
the
sound
the
headphones
are
alright
but
sometimes

now
i'm
free
of
that
realy
like

digital
and
the
piece
that

tag
bought

when
my
other
wireless
headphones
are
charging
thank
you
super

and
stays
in

while

really
handy
and
nice
writing
review
to

will
edit
later
to
reflect
my
experience
with
the
product
charged
these
earbuds
over
night
and
they
only
last
25
hours,
the
advertising
says
they
are
supposed
to
last
hours
on
single
charge
not
even
close,
will
be
returning
the
headphones
are
actually
very
comfortable
and
have
good
sound
quality
think
have
weirdly
shaped
ears
and
prefer
over
ear
headphones
but
these
work
great
and
fit
my
ears

surrounding
noises
and
fit

in
my
ears
it
seems
very
nice
earbuds,
clear
sound
they
are
not
good
for
conference
calls
but
excellent
for
sports
you
can
listen
music
while

riding
bike
or
running
very
good
connection
and
easy
to
use
seems
to
be
decent
product
intuitively

good
sound
quality
awesome
sound,
had
to
turn
them
down
it
is
product
it
fits
the
ear
comfortably
i've
enjoyed
the
sound
from
these
headphones
so
far,though
feel
like
sometimes
one
cuts
in
and
out
while
i'm
walking
the
left
one
doesn't
show
the
power
level
in
the
case
unless
push
down
on
it
love
being
able
to
use
only
one
headphone
at
time
the
sound
quality
is
really
great
typically
have
problems
with
headphones
hurting
my
ears
or
making
them
sore
and
these
have
not
caused
that
just
got
these
and
so
far
they're
great,
the
sound
is
clear
and
loud
they're
super
comfortable
in
my
ears,
other
than
there
being
music
in
my
ears
don't
even
notice
they're
there
so
far
these
headphones
work
great
and
they
connect
really
fast
to
your
phone
like
the
charging
case
and
the
volume
is
really
loud
and
can
hear
well,
unlike
previous
headphones
that
i've
purchased
in
the
past
love
everything
about
the
great
headphones,
clear
sound
and
the
connection
strength
is
amazing
can
leave
my
phone
in
the
house
while
doing
yard
word
and
never
miss
single
word
these
earbuds
are
great
all
around,
the
sound
is
perfect
and
love
the
volume
control
battery
life
is
great
too
i'm
excited
to
use
it
for
my
new
switch
they
were
fantastic
on
fit,
comfort
and
sound
but
after
sets
all
had
at
least
one
of
the
earpiece
went
bad
and
had
to
send
back
for
refund
they
fit
snug
in
my
ears
which
are
perfect
while
running,
but
unfortunately
always
have
trouble
with
them
connecting
to
my
iphone,
or
always
giving
me
an
error
messages
about
the
device
not
connecting
or
available
absolutely
love
them
like
the
quality
sound
and
battery
life
of
the
ear
buds
very
convenient
charging
and
storage
case
the
best
decision
i've
made
in
buying
these
headphones
so
comfortable
on
the
ears
and
great
sound
must
have
it
is
an
amazing
product
like
the
feeling
that
they
will
not
fall
off,
they
fit
snugg,
and
don't
hurt
use
them
for
discretion
and
privacy
great
quality
and
great
price
the
case
feels
really
nice
too
it
doesn't
feel
cheap
or
anything
and
it
has
displays
the
battery
level
inside
great
for
taking
around
with
the
48
hour
case
charge
works
sooo
good
love
the
sound
and
the
battery
life

very

well
for
my

is
very
hard
on

of
flimsy
but
overall
good
for
the
price
set
up
was
super
easy
do
recommend

looking
to
pay
lot
for

work
well
for
me
the

matches
the
quality

on
my
ears
and
the
battery

is
sufficient

nice
pair
for
the
money
bought
three
bluetooyhs
earbuds
for
my
christmas
gifts
and
am
seeing
they
have
good
quality,
no
noise
is
heard
outside
and
can
be
used
for
music,

love
the
product

stop

and
received
new
one
in

few
days

great
for
the
gym
or
any
place
with
some
background
noise
did
not
like
the
sound
quality
on
these
everything
was
bassy
and
muddy,
no
crispness
to
the
sound
these
overall
were
comfortable
and
seemed
to
work
well
with
the
exception
of
the
volume
buttons
they
were
not
functional
on
either
side
emailed
customer
service
and
never
heard
back
love
these
ear
buds
bought
them
for
cycling
and
listening
to

these
are
so

the
way
like
them

actually
stay

haven
the

battery
life
is
exactly
what
need
the
option

time
doubles
the
listening
time
to
96
hours
between
case
charges
great
sounding
headphones
they
fit
good
in
my
ear
and
sound
great,

as
loud
as
need
unlike
other
earbuds

block
them
from
getting
to
loud

main
reason

around
hours
overall

is

haven
used
the

my
only
problem
is

quite
frequently
these
are
pretty
great
earbuds
use
them
for
exercise
and
never
worry
about

and
use,
have
not
had
to
go
to
the
instructions
yet
i've
put
these
through
the
ringer
running
outside
in
the
winter
almost
every
day
have
seen
zero
issues
so
far
unlike
some
other
wireless
headphones
i've
had
this
is
much
better
than
expected
and
the
sound
is
very
goodbut
what
like
best
is
that
you
can
use
the

controlits
also

be
louder
for
max
setting

asleep
with

on
and
they
kept
on
even
after
woke
up
great
love
them
like
that
they
included
different
sizes
of
ear
buds
have
smaller

always
been
overwhelming

good

like
good
cool
like
good
good
n/a
n/a
music
the
charging
case
on
this
is
terrible
had
the
case
plugged
in
for
three
days
and
was
using
the
ear
pieces
here
and
there
the
ear
pieces
amd
case
were
fully
charged
when
unplugged
the
case
from
the
power
supply
then
left
them
at
home,
fully
charged
and
unplugged
while
ran
errands
for
the
daywhen
got
home,
about
10
hours
later,
went
to
go
use
them
to
listen
to
music
much
to
my
surprise,
even
though
both
the
case
and
ear
pieces
were
fully
charged
when
left,
the
case
only
had
38%
charge
left
this
is
unacceptable
overall,
good
set
of
headphones
for
the
money
my
only
complaints
is
that
mine
do
not
turn
off
when
placed
in
the
charger
so
it
drains
the
charging
case
battery
even
when
the
headphones
are
full
battery
unless
am
missing
something
additionally,
the
audio
cuts
out
for
second
at
time
fairly
regular
amount
usually
it
is
pretty
good
but
today
for
isn't
and
it
was
bad
enough
with
my
laptop
stopped
using
them
still
like
them
and
they're
still
good
quality
for
the
moneyupdate
about
month
later:
have
ditched
these
for
powerbeats
pro
for
black
friday
the
battery
confusion
noted
continuedthey
would
be
left
in
the
case
until
next
use
and
even
then
lower
battery
alerts
happened
frequently
also
found
sometimes
the
audio
would
cut
out
at
times
with
the
powerbeats,
no
charging
issues
and
no
audio
issuesthey
even
recognize
when
one
or
both
off
my
ears
and
pause
my
music
such
as
if
someone
talks
to
me
and
need
to
take
one
ear
off
to
listen
playback
resumes
when
put
the
earpiece
back
on
my
ear
returned
these
earbuds
after
only
few
days
as
it
was
obvious
they
were
poor
quality
even
considering
the
price
paid
they
would
not
charge
fully
and
the
indicators
in
the
case
that
were
supposed
to
show
the
level
of
charge
did
not
work
at
all
the
percentage
display
just
flickered
would
not
recommend
purchasing
these

review:holy
cow
true
wireless
has
finally
caught
up
replaced
my
lost
200$
earphones
with
these
not
true
wireless
,
wired
at
back
and
these
sound
just
as
good
only
downside
for
me
is
that
the
biggest
bud
is
still
not
enough
to
seal
outside
noises,
but
that
more
useful
for
me
at
workcannot
recommend
these
enough
no
way
you
get
better
sound
for
even
quadruple
the
price
the
sound
on
these
headphones
is
mediocre
but
the
description
of
having
"deep
bass"
is
overstated
the
bass
is
good,
better
than
other
like
headphones
i've
used,
but
certainly
not
"deep"
as
would
describe
it
wouldn't
expect
to
get
the
same
sound
quality
out
of
these
as
you
would
the
more
expensive
brands
but
also
didn't
hear
noticeable
enough
difference
to
justify
spending
the
extra
money
compared
to
cheaper
setrevised:
for
the
first
time
used
these
when
really
working
out
after
about
10
minutes
one
or
both
of
the
headphones
would
randomly
shut
off
and
then
turn
back
on
at
first
it
was
the
left,
then
the
right
had
"won"
second
set
so
tried
the
other
set
and
the
same
thing
happenedwhat
realized
is
that
when
was
sweating
sweat
lot
when
workout
the
sweat
was
"shorting
out"
the
charging
ports
sometimes
they'd
come
right
back
on,
other
times
they
wouldn't
again,
this
happened
with
both
sets
so
it
isn't
defective
product
it
is
just
horrible
designalso
what
discovered
is
that
if
you
need
to
charge
the
headphones
you
can't
have
the
case
plugged
in
what
happens
is
the
case
charges
first
and
only
when
it
gets
to
100%
do
the
headphones
start
to
charge
but
the
problem
with
that
is
that
once
the
case
drops
to
99%
from
the
headphones
drawing
charge
the
headphones
stop
charging
if
your
headphones
are
dead
and
your
case
doesn't
have
enough
charge
to
charge
them
back,
plugging
in
the
case
does
nothing
to
charge
the
headphones
until
the
case
is
fully
charged
again
another
really
poor
designfinally
the
distance
you
can
travel
from
the
device
they
are
paired
to
is
horrible
got
maybe
10
feet
away
and
they
started
cutting
outbecause
of
this
can
only
recommend
these
to
someone
who
wants
mediocre
sound,
doesn't
plan
on
using
them
often,
doesn't
plan
on
sweating
when
they
are
used,
and
doesn't
stray
too
far
from
the
device
they
are
paired
withif
the
return
period
weren't
over
they'd
be
on
their
way
back
guess
they'll
be
good
for
zoom
calls
for
work
really
like
these
earphones,
and
they
were
exactly
what
was
looking
for
but
the
case
is
major
fail
thought
got
defective
one,
so
got
replacement
still
failthese
earphones
sound
good,
they
work
independently
of
each
other,
they
turn
on
and
off
with
the
earphones,
they
have
volume
up/down
buttons,
an
actual
button
to
control
them
and
not
touch/smart
button,
and
etc
used
them
for
work
meetings
with
no
complaints
about
sound
and
dont
think
people
realized
had
them
onhere
is
the
downside
the
case
is
garbage
the
case
doesnt
always
detect
when
the
earphones
are
put
in,
so
you
have
kind
jiggle
them
or
take
them
out
and
put
them
back
it
you
can
help
this
little
by
cleaning
the
contacts
on
the
earphones
and
case
if
you
turn
the
earphones
off
and
put
them
in
the
case,
they
turn
back
on,
which
isnt
big
dealbut
the
two
major
flaws
are
this
even
if
the
earphones
are
at
100%
the
case
will
still
"charge"
and
run
down
so
if
you
want
it
to
be
able
to
charge
the
earphones,
you
have
to
charge
the
case
before
using
charged
the
earphones
inside
the
case,
both
were
at
100%
came
back
the
next
day
and
the
case
was
at
02
randomly
the
case
will
start
giving
off
very
very
low,
high
pitched
whining
noise
it
might
happen
couple
times
day
or
once
day
if
you
shake
the
case
or
move
the
earphones,
it
will
stop
its
very
annoying,
and
piercing
found
these
earbuds
extremely
hard
to
wear
put
on
and
lock
in
place
and
believe
me,
do
not
have
special
size
earsthey
never
felt
they
were
stable
bought
them
for
running
and
active
sports
activities
unless
you
are
wearing
sunglasses
because
they
anchor
them
down
not
comfortable
but
at
least
stablethe
charging
box
metal
prongs
got
stuck
just
after
two
weeks
got
them
so
one
of
the
earbuds
would
not
charge
anymore
didn't
even
bother
trying
to
fix,
call,
exchange
them
straight
in
the
trash
just
bought
these
headphones
10/29/2020
and
my
$11
earbuds
are
better
than
these
hate
wasting
money
on
something
that
is
so
misleading
let
the
case
charge
over
night
with
headphones
inserted
inside,
still
the
headphones
die
so
thought
maybe
the
case
charged
only
so
removed
the
charger
and
let
the
headphones
charge
they
work
for
exactly
hours
started
at
8:30
this
morning
halloween
they
died
11:29
am
i'm
so
hurt
and
very
upset
people
don't
have
money
to
waste
on
company
that
can
not
make
headphones,
but
charge
$30
gar
bage
do
not
buy
faulty
the
good
comfortable
on
the
ears,
sound
great,
holds
charge
well,
buttons
are
pretty
intuitive
based
on
these
items
am
happythe
bad
the
case/charging
is
bad
design
the
case
charges
just
fine
and
the
digital
readout
of
charge
level
is
great
the
phones
sit
in
perfectly
and
the
bars
tell
you
how
recharged
they
are;
again
great
but
if
you
leave
the
ear
pieces
in
the
charger
the
charger
will
continues
to
charge
and
will
deplete
itself
in
24
hours
so,
you
cannot
use
the
case
to
protect
or
travel
with
the
ear
pieces
this
is
huge
design
faulti
use
my
ear
plugs
exclusively
at
home
and
so
storing
them
without
the
case
it
stupid
but
doable
but
if
you
want
to
travel
with
the
ear
pieces
and
have
the
ability
to
use/charge
from
the
case
you
will
be
very
unhappy
would
not
recommend
these
based
solely
on
the
case
design
every
other
aspect
of
the
ear
phones
is
greatupdate
lower
stars
to
so,
you
can
manually
turn
off
the
ear
pieces
and
return
them
to
the
case
to
charge
but
when
you
do
that
they
turn
back
on,
sync
with
your
phone,
and
now
you
will
not
receive
and
notifications
or
answer
call
because
all
audio
is
going
to
the
ear
phones
which
is
in
the
case
they
are
comfortable
and
like
that
they
don't
take
up
too
much
pocket
space
the
sound
quality
is
nice
the
noise
cancelation
is
even
betterone
complaint
have
is
that
even
when
they
are
charging,
they
will
still
pick
up
calls
so,
i've
missed
calls
because
thought
that
them
being
in
the
case
and
plugged
in
would
free
my
phone
not
at
all
also
don't
like
the
fact
that
they
drain
my
phone's
battery
it
went
from
full
battery
down
to
60%
within
hours,
even
though
with
my
other
headphones
the
phone
battery
drops
at
most
to
90%
with
constant
music
and
occasional
internet
surfing
after
full
shift
at
work
the
ear
bud's
battery
life
also
drops
significantly
at
the
same
time
it's
killing
my
phone
maybe
have
bad
pair
i've
just
gone
back
to
using
my
last
pair
will
not
be
getting
anymore
bought
these
because
of
the
over
the
ear
loops
primarily
tried
different
pairs
of
the
insertable
types
and
nothing
worked
for
me
these
never
fall
off
my
ear
while
i'm
working,
golfing
etc
love
the
fact
they
have
the
volume
up/down
buttons
along
with
the
answer
button
so
don't
have
to
pull
out
my
phone
every
timethe
issues:
when
first
got
this
package
the
first
thing
did
was
to
play
few
songs
and
turn
the
volume
all
the
way
up
even
though
the
description
says
"deep
bass"
there's
hardly
any
bass
also
notice
during
phone
calls
when
i'm
around
loud
equipment/tool
etc
the
volume
isn't
loud
enough
to
hear
the
person
speaking
i've
had
them
about
month
prior
to
writing
thisi
currently
have
pairs
including
pair
of
beats,
these
are
the
best
of
the
lothope
this
helps
someone
sleek
looking
buds
that
think
are
suitable
alternative
to
airpodsedit:
after
using
them
for
quite
some
time
there
are
some
downsides
to
these1
sometimes
the
sound
will
be
out
of
sync
and
you
will
have
to
impair/turn
of
earpiece2
when
placing
in
the
charging
box
for
storage
they
will
sometimes
remain
on
and
drain
the
battery
and
you
will
find
yourself
with
dead
headphones
and
dear
charging
box
oftenother
than
those
grips
love
these
headphones
hopefully
the
next
revision
will
fix
these
issues
or
it
could
just
be
my
pairedit
2:seems
the
issue
has
resolved
itself
after
repair
the
case
again
does
not
charge
despite
replacement
by
amazon
of
the
first
one
had
contacted
seller
per
amazon
customer
service
rep,
but
no
response
received
from
manufacturer
sound
is
great,
but
if
you
wear
them
while
sweating,
your
sweat
covers
the
charging
"ports"
making
it
think
they
are
in
the
case,
so
they
shut
off
and
come
back
on
randomly
i've
had
these
ear
buds
for
while
and
within
weeks,
the
right
earbud
won't
keep
charge
i've
only
been
able
to
use
them
for
little
over
an
hour
before
have
to
switch
to
another
headset
if
had
known
this,
wouldn't
have
purchased
them
they
are
semi
comfortable,
but
not
worth
it
bought
these
for
sleep
music
am
sidesleeper
and
none
of
the
ear
pads
were
comfortable
sound
quality,
spent
years
in
the
high
end
audio
business
and
found
these
to
be
like
poorly
constructed
loudspeaker,
lots
of
boom
boom
but
don't
go
low
frequencies
no
hi
end
and
horrible
midrange
like
the
old
jbls
people
thought
they
were
good
for
bass
because
of
the
boom
boom
but
no
real
low
frequencies
and
midrange
was
an
afterthought
and
hi
frequencies
lacking
in
quality
with
no
dispersion
returning
was
not
able
to
ever
power
down
to
the
charge
wouldn't
deplete
said
they
would
power
down
in
minutes
and
never
did
they
sounded
great,
my
husband
loved
running
with
them,
but
we
don't
want
to
have
to
keep
them
on
the
charger
all
the
time
these
things
restart
with
every
push
of
the
button
not
impressed
when
the
replacements
did
the
same
thing
another
reviewer
explained
it
to
me,
the
charging
contacts
connect
with
the
side
of
your
sweaty
head
and
shut
off
automatically
ok
this
is
an
update
review
these
guys
included
promotion
scratch
off
and
it
said
won
free
pair
of
headphones
don
really
need
an
extra
pair
but
ll
give
them
to
my
kid
gave
them
good
review
like
they
asked
now
in
followup
they
said
the
product
that
showed
in
my
review
was
not
the
proper
product
which
is
total
bs
this
is
my
first
pair
of
wireless
headsets
so
how
could
get
it
wrong
waiting
to
see
if
they
send
me
free
pair
if
not
will
come
back
and
update
you
guys
so
be
forewarned
over
all
the
product
is
decent
for
the
price
but
they
are
no
dre
beats
was
hoping
to
get
good
product,
but
unfortunately
was
wrong
the
product
is
either
defective
or
not
good
to
begin
with
every
time
move
my
arm
or
head,
the
sound
goes
out,
occasionally,
at
randomcannot
recommend
this
product
at
all
these
are
terrible
they
turn
on
and
off
at
random
times
you
ll
be
in
mid
lift
and
one
ear
bud
just
turns

star

for

look
at
the
stars
less
than
full
concise
sentence
due
to
just
few
character
requirement
for
the
review
process
how
does
amazon
not
stop
this
garbage
was
hoping
for
spiffy
wireless
headphones
that
would
stay
in
my
ears
read
the
reviews
and
decided
that
these
would
work
they
do
not
hold
charge
for
more
than
one
use
that
both
the
earbuds
and
the
case
that
was
for
one
hour
worth
of
use
you
get
what
you
pay
for
find
something
better
just
got
these
yesterday,
their
very
good
earphones
so
far
awesome
noise
cancellation
and
bass
for
the
price
but
it
came
with
the
wrong
charging
cord
it's
not
big
deal
because
can
just
get
my
own,
but
still,
its
the
principal
these
headphone
don
hold
charge
long
they
also
offering
people
headphones
for
good
5star
review
and
these
aren
even
worth
the
star
but
it
as
low
as
can
give
don
waste
your
money
trying
to
get
mine
back
now
thought
the
description
claimed
that
these
had
long
battery
life
not
so
if
charge
the
today
and
don't
use
them
for
day
with
them
fully
charged,
there's
only
half
the
battery
life
left
when
am
ready
to
use
them
that's
so
disappointing
so,
only
get
half
the
battery
life
which
is
used
up
in
one
or
two
lengthy
conversations
false
advertising
and
unfortunate
because
otherwise
they
were
exactly
what
was
looking
for
the
audio
quality
was
soso
the
charging
case
lost
third
of
its
charge
in
few
hours
time,
perhaps
defective
when
submitted
my
email
address
to
register
the
product
soon
received
flood
of
dodgy
emails
from
various
sources
with
unsolicited
advertising
that
was
the
last
straw,
i'm
done
with
this
company
sent
the
earbuds
back
for
refund
audio
quality
is
okay
and
very
clear,
the
ear
pieces
are
comfortable
and
won't
fall
off
easily
the
charger
is
easy
to
use
and
the
led
power
indicators
work
very
nicely
must
take
star
off
because
the
battery
life
is
rather
short
can
get
about
35
to
hours
out
of
each
charge
each
recharge
of
the
ear
pieces
will
take
away
somewhere
around
18%
to
22%
of
the
big
battery
as
result,
the
case
can
provide
up
to
about
to
recharges
in
my
opinion,
that
hours
on
each
charge
is
rather
short
mainly
use
them
in
the
office
while
work
have
to
recharge
the
ear
pieces
during
lunch
break
or
will
risk
running
out
the
battery
your
mileage
may
vary
initially,
was
excited
when
they
came
but
as
soon
as
opened
the
case
knew
something
want
right
there
were
no
indicators
for
battery
life
of
the
case
or
buds
even
after
let
it
charge
over
night
sending
back
immediately
should've
just
went
with
my
gut
and
got
the
samsung
ones
really
wanted
it's
quite
comfortable
on
my
ears
it
comes
with
different
size
rubber
for
the
ear,
so
you
can
change
it
according
to
your
ear
size
my
charger
charges
well
they
work
okay,
use
them
for
jogging
and
exercising,
every
now
and
then
they'll
start
cutting
in
and
out
for
bit
they
are
basic
wireless
headphones
that
can
be
used
individually
or
as
set,
they
hold
charge
okay
and
pairing
was
easy
if
you
can
afford
to
spend
more
or
use
them
more
than
few
hours
week,
i'd
suggest
looking
elsewhere
had
lot
of
hope
for
these
earphones
they
were
decent
price
and
love
the
design
however
when
got
them
the
charging
cable
didn
work
at
all
the
case
would
not
charge
no
matter
what
tried
and
the
earphones
are
now
dying
also,
sometimes
one
earphone
will
randomly
turn
off
while
theother
stays
connected
hoping
these
issues
are
just
because
got
dud
so
ve
asked
for
replacement
but
so
far
these
earphones
are
major
miss
how
can
the
charging
cable
received
directly
from
the
manufacture
and
brand
new
that
came
from
their
item
not
work
poor
qualityupdate:i
ordered
the
replacement
of
these
earphones
and
they
never
arrived
ve
never
had
so
much
trouble
with
pair
of
earphones
in
my
life
had
to
ask
for
full
refund
extremely
disappointed
update:
dropping
rating
to
three
cause
the
sound
quality
is
good,
just
can't
use
them
for
what
need
them
for
these
stop
working
on
my
run
the
whole
reason
bought
them
was
to
wear
while
running
guessing
the
sweat
caused
it
couldn't
get
them
to
start
working
again
even
after
wiping
them
off
really
disappointedoriginal:
just
received
my
earbuds
and
paired
them
to
my
phone
no
issues
so
far
and
the
sound
quality
is
fantastic
the
true
test
will
be
on
how
well
they
do
when
run
half
marathon
with
them
these
headphones
sounded
like
great
idea
since
can
only
wear
one
at
work
the
charger
station
unless
you
have
it
plugged
in
decreases
the
battery
all
by
itself
even
though
the
headphones
are
fully
charged
plucked
them
into
charged
with
full
battery
on
both
headphones
the
battery
pack
does
not
hold
charge
by
itself
left
them
on
my
counter
for
day
after
being
charged
the
next
day
they
were
fully
uncharged
don't
like
that
key
factor
because
don't
wear
them
daily
and
i'm
not
going
to
leave
them
on
charger
the
good:these
headphones
have
something
other
headphones
never
had
they
stayed
on
the
ears
even
during
various
activities
from
lying
down
listening
to
music,
to
running
miles
and
sometimes
up
to
10,
and
even
stayed
on
during
an
hour
long
yoga
sessionthe
sound
quality
was
above
standard
wireless
headphone
quality
when
it
worked
even
the
microphone
and
wireless
talk
was
extremely
clear,
when
it
workedthe
bad:the
first
time
ordered
this
product
they
never
arrived
had
faith
after
narrowed
my
choices
to
different
headphones
and
these
still
came
out
on
top
in
my
personal
research
way
of
buying
online
got
them
and
in
less
than
few
days
noticed
something
wrong
haven't
even
dropped
them
once
except
on
carpet
and
the
following
has
occurredfirst,
the
headphones
drain
the
charging
case
while
in
the
case
at
all
this
seriously
decrease
the
cases
battery
lifesecond,
the
headphones
started
having
in
and
out
choppy
audio
no
matter
how
charged
they
wereverdict:these
headphones
are
ridiculously
comfortable
and
have
great
quality
but
are
buggy
shipping
failed
the
first
time
through,
the
case
drains
itself,
and
the
sound
quality
is
choppy
frequently
it
may
not
be
common
issue
but
had
them
and
so
will
be
looking
for
different
headphones
everything
works
pretty
well
with
these
ear
buds
except
holding
charge
can
charge
the
buds
in
their
box
to
full
charge
and
they
work
great
if
used
right
away
but,
as
soon
as
unplug
the
box
from
the
charger
the
box
starts
to
deplete
its
charge
without
even
removing
the
ear
buds
if
left
until
the
next
day
no
charge
left
have
another
wireless
bud
set
and
bought
these
mainly
as
back
up
because
thought
had
lost
one
of
the
ear
buds
from
my
apekxbe1028w
that
highly
recommend
they
take
charge
in
their
box
and
it
lasts
for
days
and
days,
even
when
recharging
of
the
buds
is
needed
bought
these
for
hubby
for
christmas
package
looked
sealed
and
new,
but
upon
opening
the
box
said
the
buds
were
charged
to
56%
kinda
strange
and
random,
but
whatever
they
worked
unfortunately,
once
my
husband
ran
them
down,
the
charger
box
wouldn't
charge
past
38%
again,
strange
and
random,
but
after
leaving
them
on
charger
for
more
than
24
hours
some
reviews
said
they
took
48
hours
to
charge,
still
the
charge
never
went
past
38%
sent
an
email
to
the
company
at
the
email
address
provided
in
q&as,
but
received
no
response,
thus
i've
initiated
return/refund
and
am
leaving
this
1star
review
so
that
others
might
benefit
from
our
experience
sound
cuts
out
from
right
earbud
amazon
makes
returning
product
nightmare
mine
were
dead
on
arrival
the
left
one
won't
power
on,
pair
with
the
right
one
or
pair
with
the
phone
doa
fully
charged
before
tried
anything
the
case
says
both
buds
are
at
100%
but
the
left
doesn't
function
edit:
90%
of
the
time
can't
get
any
device
to
even
show
these
if
it
does,
i'm
lucky
to
get
it
paired
the
battery
runs
down
very
fast
maybe
or
hours
not
ever
48
hours
total
waste
of
money
also,
they'll
send
you
another
pair
in
exchange
for
review
what
am
supposed
to
do
with
pairs
that
won't
connectso
far
these
are
great
they
fit
my
ears
without
the
discomfort
usually
have
from
others
love
that
when
you
connect
to
bluetooth
it
tells
you
the
%
of
battery
left
as
well
these
are
"ok"
earbuds
they
cancel
out
noise
well,
though
the
bass
boost
it
supposedly
had
is
nonexistant
they
don't
connect
well
every
time
sound
quality
is
decent
charge
case
and
charging
is
good
uncomfortable
in
my
ears
though
will
be
different
for
others
i'm
sure
again
they
aren't
terrible,
just
"ok"
the
sound
quality
was
what
you
would
expect
but
there
were
two
problems
one,
the
case
battery
when
it
reached
100%
would
drain
down
to
0%
in
about
24
hours
after
being
fully
charged
two,
the
volume
controls
on
the
ear
buds
only
worked
occasionally
the
email
customer
service
however
was
quite
good
and
they
sent
me
2nd
set
purchased
this
item
for
the
battery
hours
and
playback
time
received
my
1st
one
and
charged
it
the
pack
and
the
earbuds
were
at
100%
by
the
next
morning
the
case
was
at
22%
had
not
even
paired
the
earbuds
yet
so
there
was
not
reason
for
the
battery
pack
to
loose
over
75%
of
its
life
so
returned
it,
and
received
2nd
one
of
the
same
type
was
giving
the
product
another
chance
as
electronics
can
have
flaws
received
my
2nd
case,
of
the
same
product
charged
it
so
it
was
at
100%
before
bed
the
earbuds
have
not
been
paired
or
used
the
morning,
the
case
was
at
39%
slight
improvement,
but
not
what
was
expecting
have
purchased
earbuds
and
matching
cases
before
from
different
companies
and
they
never
drained
like
this
this
product
is
suppose
to
have
total
of
40
hours
of
playtime,
including
the
battery
case
however,
if
go
on
trip
and
fully
charge
it
and
do
not
use
it
until
the
next
day
will
only
get
hours
of
time
from
the
buds
as
the
case
will
be
drained
and
useless
do
not
recommend
this
product
as
there
is
some
type
of
product
flaw
will
be
returning
the
product
for
the
2nd
time
for
full
refund
yesterday
was
my
first
time
wearing
them
put
the
more
when
get
to
work
they
kept
saying
disconnecting
if
laid
my
phone
down
on
the
table
and
walk
very
short
distance
it
was
say
disconnecting
people
say
they
could
barely
hear
me
today
it
keeps
saying
disconnecting
and
i've
only
had
them
on
for
hours
and
this
is
the
first
time
love
you
some
as
far
as
talking
to
someone
have
not
listened
to
the
radio
or
anyting
it
keeps
saying
disconnecting,
they
sent
me
second
pair
and
the
right
one
said
low
battery
how
is
that
and
eventually
the
right
one
cutoff
but
the
left
one
was
still
working
this
is
horrible
i'm
returning
this
pair
to
don't
want
another
pair
just
prefacing
this
to
say
haven't
used
these
while
working
out
yet
but
have
very
high
hopes
for
them
because
they
fit
so
snug
on
my
ears
do
have
smallish
ears
though
so
someone
with
large
ears
might
consider
these
little
too
snugthe
quality
was
much
better
than
expected
and
these
headphones
are
loud
really
didn't
expect
much
so
they
easily
surpassed
my
expectationsit's
also
my
first
time
having
headphones
that
have
this
digital
"screen"
type
of
interface
in
the
case
but
am
quite
impressed
it's
pretty
handy
for
checking
the
battery
level
without
having
to
turn
the
headphones
oni'll
update
this
post
if
find
anything
bad
about
them
but
so
far
they
seem
like
great
headphonesupdate:
ok
so
i've
worked
out
times
now
with
these
and
here's
my
thoughts
if
you
don't
already
have
pair
of
headphones
or
just
need
to
replace
some
broken
ones
then
these
are
ok
for
that
but
after
giving
these
decent
amount
of
usage
have
lost
the
honeymoon
phase
and
think
these
are
just
ok
i'm
actually
not
even
sure
want
to
keep
them
because
have
gotten
so
used
to
heavy
bass
from
my
nonworkout
sony
headphones
that
now
i'm
thinking
just
need
more
bass
even
at
it's
loudest
just
wasn't
feeling
the
bass
these
claim
to
have
so
little
disappointed
because
was
initially
blown
away
and
thought
they
looked
pretty
cool
package
arrive
in
larger
box
but
with
no
filling
so
it
was
jostled
around
during
shipping
charging
case
hinge
is
damaged
and
led
does
not
monitor
battery
life
at
all
given
it
does
not
even
turn
on
so
do
not
even
know
if
the
case
is
charging
the
headphones
do
not
know
if
these
are
just
base
issues
or
an
issue
caused
by
the
packagingotherwise
they
paired
to
my
phone
easy
enough
and
have
good
sound
quality
bought
these
to
use
in
the
gym
they
headphones
come
with
"scratchoff"
prize
thing
which
won
and
was
told
to
send
an
email
to
customer
support
to
claim
my
prize
which
was
free
pair
of
headphones
one
of
the
prerequisites
to
claiming
that
was
leaving
star
review
or
explaining
why
not
and
letting
them
address
the
issue
here's
the
issue:
tried
the
headphones
in
the
gym
once
and
these
get
so
much
interference,
literally
can't
put
my
phone
in
my
pocket
or
walk
past
someone
without
my
music
suddenly
cutting
off
several
times
told
the
customer
support
rep
from
the
company
and
they
basically
told
me
to
record
the
headphones
and
prove
ithow
how
am
supposed
to
record
something
that
happens
inconsistently
so
not
only
did
they
send
me
faulty
pair
of
headphones
and
not
believe
me
that
they
do
not
work
as
advertised,
but
they
tried
to
get
me
to
write
fake
review
for
them
and
then
stopped
responding
to
me
when
tried
to
explain
not
happening,
terrible
customer
service
maybe
was
in
1000
defective
product
recipient
but
honestly
buy
at
your
own
risk
because
if
you
end
up
like
me
you
won't
get
any
help
got
these
specifically
for
use
while
work
outdoors
and
while
exercise
unfortunately,
the
only
time
they
work
well
is
when
you
aren
active
nothing
worse
than
being
up
in
tree
unable
to
concentrate
because
these
earbuds
keep
cutting
in
and
out
with
no
apparent
rhyme
or
reason
they
work
alright
if
sitting
still
or
walking
in
store,
but
even
then
they
disconnect
and
turn
off
for
no
reasonalso,
they
aren
as
sweat
resistant
as
they
claim
starting
to
suspect
that
why
they
re
not
working
properly
have
friend
that
owns
and
likes
these
headphones
so
purchased
set
for
my
stepdaughter
received
them
next
day,
but
they
initially
would
not
power
up
until
worked
with
tech
supportcleaned
contacts,
reset
the
earbuds
the
earbuds
eventually
worked,
but
the
case
battery
was
at
0%
and
refused
to
charge,
either
with
the
included
charger
or
another
known
good
chargeri
returned
the
defective
unit
and
amazon
was
prompt
in
sending
replacement
this
set
powered
up,
but
again,
the
case
battery
refused
to
charge
no
mater
what
charger
connected,
even
over
night
really
wanted
to
keep
them
ordered
pair
during
prime
day
and
loved
them
the
earbuds
kept
falling
out
the
charging
box
and
that
where
noticed
the
first
issue
there
was
missing
screw
in
the
charging
box
and
that
resulted
in
the
lid
not
closing
correctly,
letting
the
earbuds
fall
out
so
exchanged
them
for
new
pair
this
second
pair,
all
over
not
great
the
full
battery
drained
over
night
twice
asa
it
connected
to
my
phone
while
the
ear
buds
were
in
the
charging
box
didn
have
bluetooth
or
anything
playing
on
my
phone
to
drain
the
battery
this
never
happened
with
the
first
pair
in
addition,
the
buttons
did
not
respond
when
attempted
to
turn
them
off
after
run
they
say
power
off
but
10
seconds
later
they
turn
back
on
automatically
never
happened
with
that
first
pair
either
the
sound
is
great
and
they
re
super
confortable,
plus
the
battery
life
is
supposed
to
be
great
were
with
that
first
pair
feel
got
two
bad
batches
they
re
really
neat
but
had
bad
bad
luck
twice
had
these
headphones
for
one
week
these
have
to
absolutely
be
the
worst
pair
of
earbuds
ve
ever
owned
in
my
entire
life
cannot
beg
you
enough
to
not
buy
these
unless
you
want
headphones
that
constantly
turn
themselves
on
and
off
run
to
miles
every
day
and
these
ruined
every
single
one
of
my
runs
for
an
entire
week
do
yourself
favor
and
buy
the
cheaper
$20
earbuds,
you
ll
thank
me
the
picture
added
to
this
review
is
me
being
so
put
out
and
frustrated
with
these
earbuds
that
didn
even
want
to
waste
the
time
to
return
them
and
stomped
them
out
mid
run
1000%
do
not
buy
these
not
even
worthy
of
one
star
but
guess
you
have
to
give
them
some
thing
love
the
over
head
clips
and
physical
buttons,
use
them
on
the
go
without
fear
of
losing
them
sound
and
microphone
quality
are
excellent
comes
with
usb
charging
and
charge
indicators
excellent
deal
for
the
cost*****

to
change
my
review
in

for

say
no
have
given
an
accurate
review
of
my

so
far
they
will
continues
to
harass
you
long
after
you
return
the
item
just
don't
even
get
these
waste
of
time
this
company
actually
makes
the
buyers
give
star
review
just
to
activate
the
warranty
meaning,
when
went
to
register
my
product
for
the
warranty,
had
to
give
five
star
review
first
which
explains
their
multiple
star
ratings
these
headphones
aren
terrible
but
they
do
tend
to
just
cut
out
while
using
them
then
turn
themselves
back
ononly
had
them
for
few
days
so
far
and
already
have
issues
had
an
issue
with
the
battery
charge
life
and
the
headsets
charge
connector
i'm
sorry,
but
i'm
not
going
to
play
the
shipping/return
game
to
try
to
find
one
that
does
work
correctly
and
as
advertised
my
rating
is
actually
0%
because
the
bad
battery
life
of
the
charging
case
and
the
defective
charging
connectors
to
the
headsets
and
the
headsets
loosing
battery
charge,
even
when
not
in
use
thought
finally
had
good
product
and
was
excited
to
purchase
only
to
get
about
30
minutes
of
talk
time
before
totally
dead

awful
is

cut

very
disappointing
looks
good,
fit
great
but
the
sound

is
constantly
going
out
and
i'm
holding
my

in
my
hand
now
the
case
only
charges
one
of
the
earbuds
these
headphones
work
alright
unless
you
plan
on
working
out
with
them
and
you
sweati
used
these
headphones
for
few
weeks
and
they
work
okay
for
my
shorter
runs,
but
when
ever
run
for
more
than
1015
minutes
and
start
to
work
up
good
sweat
they
are
terrible
think
what
is
happening
is
the
sweat
on
my
head
is
creating
some
kind
of
contact
with
the
charging
spot
on
the
headphones
amd
they
turn
off
because
they
think
they
are
being
charged
so
they
are
constantly
dropping
connection
and
reconnecting
while
i'm
trying
to
run
listening
to
them
say
"power
on"
every
10
seconds
i'm
giving
these
to
my
wife
and
buying
myself
pair
of
headphones
that
don't
have
charging
connecting
that
rest
against
my
skin
to
hopefully
avoid
this
problem
in
the
future
the
battery
charge
in
the
case
continually
drains
when
store
fully
charged
buds
in
the
case
this
seems
bizarre
design,
and
it
is
hard
to
believe
this
the
way
it
is
supposed
to
work
the
case
battery
charge
drops
50%
if
the
fully
charged
buds
are
left
in
the
charging
case
overnight
when
open
the
case,
it
seems
the
display
digits
for
the
case
charge
are
always
on,
and
the
buds
leds
keep
flashing
blue
to
red
to
blue
what's
the
point
of
battery
case
to
store
them
in
if
just
storing
them
there
drains
themi
also
find
it
odd
that
the
buds
don't
have
any
indicator
led
to
show
that
they
are
on
this
having
to
check
any
device
they
may
be
connected
to,
or
directly
toggling
the
power
unfortunately,
the
voice
announcement
of
the
power
on
or
off
status
can
be
so
faint,
it
can
be
hard
to
understandthese
are
simple
design
criteria
that
even
modestly
priced
unit
should
fulfill
some
of
the
info
in
the
descriptions
is
bit
misleading,
otherwise
full
stars
are
due
the
48
hr
run
time
stated
in
the
description
is
the
total
run
time
using
the
fantastic
charging
case
to
charge
the
buds
times
with
an
average
actual
playtime
of
hours
that
being
said
have
purchased
over
time
several
ear
buds
in
the
30$
range
and
so
far
this
set
is
the
finest
i've
used
very
small
and
comfortable,
interface
buttons
that
are
easy
to
use,
great
sound,
and
the
visual
charging
indicators
are
great
the
stated
distance
of
30'
is
pretty
darn
accurate
as
well
for
the
money,
can
highly
recommend
you
try
these
don't
think
you
will
be
disappointed
the
sound
quality
was
great
and
the
noise
cancelling
perfect
those
qualities
are
not
worth
thing
if
the
charging
case
doesn
charge
the
ear
buds
had
the
ear
buds
in
the
case,
with
the
case
on
the
charge
and
the
earbuds
never
charged
have
only
had
them
for
one
week
if
can
find
all
of
the
packaging,
will
be
returning
them
if
not,
they
are
going
into
the
garbage
these
are
nice
headphones,
but
the
battery
does
not
hold
the
charge
they
had
no
power
on
arrival,
which
was
surprise,
because
most
items
have
at
least
little
charge
charged
them,
and
they
worked
well
however,
after
about
45
minutes
of
use,
the
battery
was
spent
recharged
them,
and
once
again,
the
battery
power
started
decreasing
immediately
although
didn't
use
them,
the
battery
decreased
completely
within
few
hours
sadly,
these
will
be
returned
charging
base
was
deadonarrival
wouldn't
light
up
when
plugged
in
wouldn't
charge
the
headphones
returned
immediately
would
not
hold
charge
had
to
plug
them
in
every
time
after
use
would
not
last
hrs
think
they
might
have
been
used
very
disappointing
guess
you
get
what
you
pay
for
returned
the
sound
is
okay
the
battery
life
is
horrible
the
charging
case
has
to
be
plugged
in
for
it
to
charge
the
headphones
the
headphones
do
not
automatically
start
to
charge
when
you
put
them
in
the
case
and
they
do
not
automatically
pair
to
my
device
so
in
essence,
all
of
the
advertised
features
that
drew
me
to
these
headphones
do
not
work
returning
them
now
horrible
battery
life
until
came
completely
dead
charged
it
overnight
and
it
showed
100%
in
less
than
10
minutes
set
up
and
testing
it
was
was
already
at
90%
in
less
than
hours
it
was
dead
put
them
in
the
case
to
recharge
and
the
case
was
dead
too
nothing
but
problems
from
the
getgo
will
not
stay
on
will
not
stay
connected
one
turns
on
and
the
other
turns
off
malfunctions
with
sweat
do
not
buy
fully
charged,
would
last
no
more
than
hours;
one
side
went
out
permanently;
often
lost

was
less
than
85%;
returned
pros:
fits
comfortably,
they
don't
fall
to
the
floor
like
other
styles
noticeably
missing
is
any
background
hiss
when
movie
goes
quiet
between
scenes
sounds
great
watching
movies
barely
even
feel
them
on
cons:
not
enough
bass
listening
to
music
no
sound
isolation
in
loud
environments
sometimes
they
disconnect
and
reconnect
even
though
my
phone
is
next
to
me
or
on
my
lap
this
one
doesn't
hold
charge
replaced
with
same
item
and
may
be
sending
back
again
because
the
speakers
keep
fading
in
and
out
while
listening
the
earbuds
work
well
enough,
sound
quality
is
ok
could
be
louder
for
$20
dollars,
it's
alright
for
the
price
for
such
product
my
only
issue
is
that
the
charging
indicator
lights
on
the
inside
of
the
case
don't
seem
to
work
i'm
sure
it's
just
defective
case;
thankfully
not
major
concern
as
typically
keep
the
case
chargingedit:
so
after
three
days,
and
total
of
maybe
an
hour
of
use,
the
earbud
batteries
die
can't
be
right
considering
i've
left
them
in
the
charging
base
in
between
uses
and
the
base
has
been
plugged
in
can
only
assume
that
if
the
base
indicator
lights
don't
work
and
the
earbuds
aren't
charging,
received
defective
base
that
makes
the
rest
of
the
purchase
useless
review
changed
from
stars
to
as
soon
as
tried
to
use
these
headphones,
was
dismayed
to
learn
that
the
right
headphone
simply
would
not
work
additionally,
the
overall
packaging
and
feel
of
the
product
do
feel
fairly
cheap,
even
for
product
under
$50
initially
the
headphones
worked
very
well
after
just
few
weeks
the
the
battery
life
didn't
hold
charge
and
only
was
able
to
get
4045
minutes
before
recharging
they
are
very
comfortable
and
easy
to
operate
but
they
do
not
really
do
any
significant
job
in
cancelling
outside
noise
please
don
waste
your
money
bought
these
and
thought
they
were
great
even
won
free
pair
by
purchasing
these
they
worked
great
for
about
month
then
the
sound
started
messing
up
and
now
they
won
even
hold
charge
the
new
pay
received
charged
once
and
they
stopped
working
ll
never
purchase
from
this
seller
again
i'm
updating
my
review
to
star
these
are
literally
the
worst
headphones
i've
ever
had
had
really
high
hopes
from
all
the
good
reviews
but
the
more
use
them
the
more
absolutely
hate
them
they
die
after
just
few
hours
and
specifically
bought
them
for
the
long
battery
life
can
only
use
the
left
one
buy
itself
the
other
one
won't
connect
without
the
other
one
never
wrote
bad
reviews
but
these
are
so
bad
had
to
the
units
don't
quite
fit
into
charging
case
correctly,
so
you
get
whining
sound
if
they
aren't
secure
and
they
don't
stay
on
the
charging
station
when
running,
they
will
shut
off
if
you
get
sweaty
worked
amazingly
at
first
month
in
they
don
hold
charge
or
stay
connected
first
time
dropped
it
about
two
feet
the
front
cover
flew
off
leaving
the
rest
intact
now
you
can
see
what
inside
needs
design
upgrade
outer
shell
the
first
pair
got
had
an
issue
with
the
right
earbud
where
it
would
say
"power
on"
for
no
reason
and
then
cut
out
or
it
would
just
cut
out
for
minutes
at
time
the
2nd
pair
got
after
exchanging
had
the
same
issue
and
then
after
about
uses,
the
right
earbud
stopped
working
completely
do
not
waste
your
money
great
sound
but
not
comfortable
for
my
ears
falls
off
easily
have
small
earsupdate
1:removing
one
star
because
am
starting
to
get
harassment
emails
from
the
seller
if
get
another
email
will
remove
another
starupdate
2:removed
another
star
getting
more
harassment
emails
shame
on
amazon
to
allow
such
things
to
happen
to
their
customers
am
not
removing
this
review
and
it
final
when
got
my
first
pair
of
these
charged
the
headphones
in
the
case
per
the
instructions
prior
to
going
to
bed
overnight
without
ever
using
the
headphones
the
case
had
drained
from
100%
battery
to
60%
battery
by
the
end
of
the
day
the
case
no
longer
had
any
battery
life
and
could
not
charge
the
headphones
the
headphones
themselves
seem
to
retain
battery
fine
tried
the
process
again
with
the
same
results
the
next
day
the
storage
case
didn't
hold
charge
for
longer
than
24
hoursocciam
sent
me
replacement
pair
to
be
fair,
they
have
pretty
good
customer
service
and
the
issue
is
basically
the
same
in
the
first
24
hours
after
charging
the
case
to
100%
the
case
had
drained
to
just
41%,
without
using
the
headphones
at
the
end
of
the
second
day
the
case
was
drained
again
without
using
the
headphonesi
charge
the
case/headphones
now
only
when
the
headphones
themselves
run
out
of
battery
don't
bother
using
the
case
as
backup
because
the
charge
doesn't
last
past
48
hours
the
headphones
themselves
have
decent
soundquality,
though,
and
they
stay
in
my
ears
which
are
small
really
well
when
i'm
running
microphone
has
bit
of
feedback
on
calls
but
it's
not
bad;
connectivity
with
other
devices
is
fine
received
defected
charging
case
that
will
not
charge
the
earbuds
the
earbuds
themselves
work
and
sound
good,
but
have
no
way
to
charge
them
because
the
charging
case
simply
doesn't
work
i've
tried
connecting
the
type
cable
that
comes
with
it
to
different
charging
ports
but
it
simply
doesn't
workedit:after
leaving
the
star
rating
was
contacted
by
the
seller
who
offered
free
replacement
gave
the
seller
my
shipping
location
and
was
shipped
another
case
and
earbuds
free
of
charge
this
new
case
and
earbuds
do
work
the
seller
was
very
polite
and
professional
so
am
now
giving
star
rating
the
seller
really
does
care
amazon
also
refunded
my
money
on
the
defected
pair
this
is
pretty
good
unit,
have
been
using
it
for
almost
week
it
has
some
issues
where
you
can
hear
person
talking
but
they
can
not
hear
you
and
the
buttons
on
the
headset
do
not
seem
to
connect
or
control
actions
on
the
phone
this
has
only
happened
once
so
far
it
holds
well
on
the
ear
and
you
can
only
barely
tell
it's
there
as
it
is
super
light
overall
it's
one
of
the
best
pairs
of
bluetooth
headsets
have
used
top
notch
sound
quality
and
really
good
battery
life
you
can
charge
this
the
previous
night
and
it
continuously
will
lose
charge
even
when
you
aren't
using
it
and
be
dead
by
the
time
you
want
to
use
it
terribly
inconvenient
fit
and
sound
quality
are
commendable
this
product
has
potential
,
certainly
in
this
price
range
typically,
only
bother
with
reviews,
when
can
provide
four
and
five
star
reviews
the
occiam
will
be
the
only
two
star
review
i've
written:
on
receipt
completed
the
warranty
card
and
submitted
it
online
placed
case
on
charger
per
directions
attempted
to
remove
headphones
from
case
,
and
the
case
lid
detached
from
the
case
this
is
an
oval
rounded
case
type
case
as
an
older
person
with
limited
dexterity
had
to
use
the
thumbnail
of
my
opposing
hand
to
open
the
case
when
the
top
detached
however,
at
no
time
did
use
excessive
force
or
pressure
in
opening
the
top
of
the
case
placed
the
case
lid
back
on
the
charging
case
to
what
would
appear
to
be
the
original
position
at
this
time
fully
charged
the
case
and
earphones
to
its
fully
charged
capacity,
as
indicated
by
the
digital
meters
placed
earphones
in
both
ears
and
listened
to
my
preferred
70's
music
thought
sound
quality
was
adequate
for
my
needs
placed
phone
call
to
family
member,
and
call
quality
was
satisfactory
on
both
ends
failed
to
mention
that
the
earphones
paired
immediately
with
my
iphone
certainly
no
issues
or
complaints
at
this
point
placed
phones
back
in
case
and
charged
once
again
to
100%
and
retired
for
the
evening
the
following
morning
retrieved
phones
from
case
to
notice
that
they
had
discharged
almost
40%
overnight
without
being
in
use
emailed
the
customer
service
department
to
ask
if
this
was
normal
no
response
from
customer
support
within
the
24
hours
response
time
suggested
in
the
owners
manual
used
the
headsets
couple
of
hours
throughout
the
day,
and
once
again
recharged
to
100%
,
with
the
same
discharge
the
following
morning
again
contacted
the
customer
service
department
by
email,
giving
little
more
detail
about
the
detached
case
top,
and
waited
the
24
hours
for
response,
with
no
reply
or
guidance
the
identical
events
occurred
the
following
day
as
well,
still
having
had
no
response
from
occiam
sent
the
third
email
to
the
customer
service
department
this
time
adding
the
fact
would
be
writing
this
review
,
discussing
the
fragility
of
the
case
lid
and
the
failure
of
occiam
customer
support
to
offer
assistance
after
repeated
requests
it's
been
number
of
days
now
since
my
first
email
to
occiam
,
and
unfortunately
am
submitting
my
first
two
star
review
this
is
not
meant
to
detract
from
the
sound
quality
or
functionality
of
the
headphones,
its
an
indictment
of
the
customer
service
at
occiam
there's
an
old
addage:
sucker
punch
me
once,
shame
on
you,
sucker
punch
me
twice
,
shame
on
me
will
never
purchase
another
occiam
product,
nor
recommend
them
to
anyone
care
about
these
would
have
been
great
if
they
had
actually
fit
my
ears
they
include
three
sizes
for
the
rubber
pieces
that
go
into
your
ears,
but
the
smallest
was
still
too
big
for
me
the
plastic
piece
that
wraps
around
your
ear
to
hold
it
in
place
was
also
just
slightly
too
big,
so
they
would
often
fall
off
during
use
11
btw,
not
child
with
small
ears
lolotherwise,
didn
have
any
problem
with
the
sound
quality
itself
really
wanted
to
like
these
great
concept
considering
really
like
the
cordless
bluetooth
idea
without
the
touch
crap
most
of
the
touch
control
headphones
are
too
sensitive
so
prefer
pushbutton
these
are
almost
perfect
except,
once
again
just
not
loud
enough
ve
tested
multiple
songs
across
every
eq
option,
still
not
as
loud
as
some
of
the
cheap,
corded
headphones
have
they
are
still
decent
headphones
for
indoor
quiet
use
though
not
great
for
outdoor,
working
out
near
traffic,
noise
etcupdate***worse
left
ear
piece
just
stopped
working
didn
last
dozen
uses
want
my
money
back
it
connects
when
pulling
away
from
ear
to
check
of
on,
then
when
placing
it
back
on
ear
it
disconnects
do
not
buy
the
sound
quality
is
fantastic
at
$2899
these
earbuds
literally
blow
away
my
$12900
jabra
65t
active
elite
earbuds
wore
the
occiam
earbuds
for
two
hours
straight,
with
no
discomfort
the
reason
didn't
give
it
stars
is
because
you
don't
get
charging
block/adaptor
but
for
29
bucks,
that's
ok
would
love
to
by
another
pair
but
they're
already
out
of
stock
too
bad
these
were
either
defectiveor
just
crap
earbuds
seemed
to
not
keep
consistent
contact
with
the
case
as
they
would
constantly
quit
charging
well
before
the
batteries
could
even
possibly
be
full,
sometimes
right
away
as
soon
as
id
put
them
in
the
case
tried
taking
the
rubber
inear
pieces
off
but
it
made
no
difference
also
the
earbuds
would
not
keep
contact
with
my
phone
they
would
constantly
disconnect
randomly
even
with
the
phone
right
next
to
me
&
each
time
went
to
use
them
had
to
forget
them
from
my
phone
&
rediscover
themsometimes
multiple
times
before
they
would
actually
connect
to
my
phone
it
became
incredibly
annoying
definitely
not
worth
the
"value
of
the
discount"
in
my
opinion
so
returned
them
after
just
few
days
of
aggravated
use
like
these
headphones
as
they
don't
fall
out
when
i'm
active
like
my
other
headphones
unfortunately,
they
aren't
as
loud
either
so
when
its
loud
around
me,
like
on
treadmill,
these
are
loud,
but
not
enough
to
down
out
ambient
noises
around
me
and
when
my
rocking
song
comes
on,
just
not
enough
to
fit
my
tastes
but,
they
stay
in
my
ear
and
overall
sound
pretty
good
for
the
price
still
searching
for
that
perfect
set
of
ear
buds
wanted
to
give
these
stars
because
they
give
you
chance
at
an
amazon
gift
card
if
you
do
but
can'tmic
is
good
sound
quality
good
connection
is
unstable
walking
home
with
my
phone
in
my
pocket,
these
headphones
brand
new,
had
them
less
than
week
kept
slipping
the
connection
between
each
other
and
the
phone
so
that
the
sound
was
continuously
changing
ears
and
pausing
for
second
or
two
know
it
isn't
my
phone
because
my
two
other
sets
of
headphones
still
connect
and
have
no
issues
these
are
ones
will
still
use
for
watching
streaming
services
in
bed,
because
then
have
no
trouble
and
they
do
not
have
flashing
lights
that
would
otherwise
wake
anyonethey
really
are
good
quality
if
you're
just
wanting
ones
for
when
you're
staying
in
one
place,
like
studying
or
hands
free
phone
calls
but
they
are
terrible
for
sports
and
movement
there
are
so
many
great
reviews
about
these
headphones,
but
tbh
they
re
not
all
that
yes
they
are
noise
canceling
butwhen
you
are
working
out
and
you
want
that
extra
loudness
it
not
there
yes
they
are
light
weight,
yes
they
have
cool
packaging,
yes
they
have
good
battery
life,
but
not
loud
enough
for
me
guess
they
be
good
for
quiet
atmosphere
but
not
for
noisy

the

the

honestly
like
the
set
lot
but
have
small
issue
with
the
battery
life
as
soon
as
unplugged
it
after
the
first
full
charge
it
went
down
to
72%
after
couple
of
hours
of
unplugging
them
even
though
had
not
used
them
it
was
pretty
strange
i'm
hoping
it
doesn't
happen
again
because
really
like
these
earbuds21/01/21
update:kept
using
them
won't
stay
charged
for
longer
than
two
hours
just
got
these,
so
can't
attest
to
the
battery
life
the
quality
is
also
pretty
good,
definitely
decent
amount
of
bass
they
don't
really
seem
to
cancel
noise,
as
the
description
says,
but
the
volume
is
good
enough
that
with
the
right
music,
you
can
drown
outside
noise
outhowever,
have
weirdly
shaped/sized
ears,
so
always
have
to
change
the
bubble
pads
on
my
headphones
not
sure
of
the
actual
term
unfortunately,
the
smaller
ones
that
come
with
these
headphones
don't
actually
fit
on
the
pod
itself
the
medium
and
large
ones
fit,
but
it's
bit
of
struggle
to
get
them
on
fortunately,
the
mediums
are
still
an
alright
fit
other
than
that,
i'm
happy
so
far
i'll
come
back
and
edit
if
notice
anything
else
as
use
them
more
ve
purchased
few
ear
buds
in
the
past
but
they
weren
really
for
me
use
them
couple
of
times
and
that
would
be
it
as
matter
of
fact
they
re
in
box
somewhere
took
look
at
these
and
decided
to
give
them
try
was
very
pleased
with
my
purchase
these
are
used
every
day
while
at
work
so
can
listen
to
my
music
during
the
day
they
fit
my
ears
perfectly
and
the
sound
quality
is
pretty
good
these
are
also
good
with
calls
as
well
with
the
other
buds,
had
people
tell
me
it
was
difficult
to
hear/understand
me
that
wasn
the
case
with
these
would
recommend
these
to
anyone
looking
for
some
good
ear
buds
at
reasonable
price
think
these
headphones
are
an
ok
value
what
do
like
is
that
they
pair
so
easily
and
charge
immediately
in
the
case
the
case
does
not
need
to
be
plugged
in
very
frequently
to
charge
the
headphones
what
don
like
is
that
they
don
produce
enough
volume
even
at
100%
they
do
not
generate
enough
sound
to
hear
music
well
also
the
lid
to
the
case
looks
really
flimsy
and
cautious
with
it
to
protect
it
from
breaking
bought
these
for
the
supposed
hour
battery
life
turns
out
it
less
than
hours
right
earbud
intermittently
cuts
in
and
out
the
earbuds
are
comfortable
and
feel
secure,
but
difficult
to
change
the
little
silicone
piece,
which
sometimes
detaches
from
the
earbuds
when
remove
them
battery
life
if
extremely
short
lost
my
last
set
that
had
for
over
year
that
paid
$15
for
they
lasted
8+
hours
this
headset
hear
can
not
make
hours
on
full
charge
completely
disappointed
and
now
they
are
going
right
back
back
to
the
drawing
board
they
keep
cutting
in
and
out
without
losing
connection
i've
tried
disconnecting
restating
my
phone
and
everything
overall
not
pleased
with
the
money
spent
am
not
hearing
impaired
but
the
volume
was
not
as
advertised
have
it
all
the
way
up
all
the
time
for
music
or
phone
conversations
very
disappointing
they
work
ok,
but
for
some
reason
they
randomly
disconnect
and
reconnect
within
second
or
two,
that
is
with
my
phone
in
my
pocket
so
the
range
isn't
the
issue
definitely
was
not
noise
cancelling
never
waseven
when
new
they
did
work
well
for
few
weeks
and
then
only
worked
when
they
wanted
would
not
buy
again
started
off
great
but
then
after
few
days
had
problems
the
headphones
would
power
off
randomly
when
fully
charged,
one
headphone
would
turn
off
while
the
other
is
still
on,
and
other
problems
volume
control
does
not
work
kept
pressing
the
volume
up/down
control
buttons
but
the
sound
will
change
little
when
maximizing
the
volume
using
the
phone,
the
sound
is
not
loud
enough
was
looking
to
love
these,
but
i'm
extremely
disappointed
works
at
long
range
they
will
randomly
disconnect
either
individually
or
simultaneously
every
time
use
it
it
only
for
25
seconds
only
use
it
at
night
when
in
bedneed
to
hear
stuff
to
fall
asleep
it
fine
for
my
purpose
however,
can
see
that
being
an
issue
if
you
use
for
more
than
hour
it
charges
fast
ear
buds
have
long
charge
this
is
great
product,
but
seem
to
have
very
hard
time
connecting
this
device
to
the
bluetooth
connection
on
my
windows
10
computer
otherwise,
there
is
really
no
problem
with
this
product
the
headphones
are
great,
they
are
loud
and
have
good
sound
quality
and
the
battery
life
is
good
but
the
case
is
absolute
trash
the
cover
broke
on
the
first
day
while
was
closing
the
case
have
been
using
these
earbuds
for
couple
of
days
now
overall
they
are
good
and
worth
the
money
below
are
the
pros
and
conspros:
very
light
weight
and
they
are
excellent
for
running
the
earhooks
are
very
secure
eventhough
there
is
no
active
noise
cancelling
the
audio
output
is
loud
enough
that
do
not
hear
any
noise
awesome
sound
for
podcasts
and
voice
calls
ok
sound
for
listening
to
music
need
to
use
the
music
player's
equalizer
to
get
the
sound
that
like
good
basscons:
case's
lid
is
not
spring
loaded
the
multi
functional
buttons
are
not
so
reactive
have
to
press
the
mtb
couple
of
times
for
my
phone
to
react
no
noise
cancelling
have
hard
time
finding
headphones
that
fit
my
ears
well
these
were
comfortable
and
great
for
listening
to
my
books
and
music
love
that
they
charge
in
the
case
one
improvement
would
recommend
is
having
latching
case
had
to
put
the
case
inside
zippered
case
for
travel
so
they
didn't
fall
out
other
than
that
really
like
the
headphones
over
all
would
purchase
this
item
again,
because
it
would
work
great
if
you
listen
to
music
for
few
hours
at
time
work
overnight
so
need
battery
life
of
5+
hours
these
lasted
about
hours,
which
was
not
bad
like
the
digital
screen
of
how
much
battery
life
is
remaining
the
sound
quality
was
pretty
good
thought
it
was
better
than
the
powerbeats
pro,
which
was
using
simultaneously
with
these
had
zero
connection
issues
with
these,
which
is
more
than
can
say
about
the
powerbeats
pro
returned
due
to
connection
issues
to
laptop
these
headphones
connected
to
my
phone
and
laptop
with
no
issues
recommend
if
you
want
to
listen
for
hours
and
it
fits
your
budget
would
buy
again
this
is
pretty
much
good
quality
headphone
for
the
price

yes

at

you
feel

can
say
if

it

awesomebest
part
about
this
earbud
headphone
is
voice
call
quality
this
one
catches
your
voice
so
clearly
and
other
end
person
over
will
have
no
complain
hearing
you
but
yes
it
catches
background
noises
and
other
end
person
over
phone
can
hear
it
but
believe
it
tries
to
minimize
noises
other
than
that
you
can
both
enjoy
quality
call
love
itbad:charging
case
looks
cheap
but
when
you
grab
it
with
hand
doesn
feel
cheap
display
of
battery
life
is
awesome
but
wish
you
could
see
the
display
of
charging
outside
of
the
case
when
you
close
the
lidif
you
don
turn
off
your
headphone
and
it
was
still
connected
to
your
device,
when
you
put
them
inside
the
box
for
charging
it
will
always
disconnect
which
is
good
but
believe
somehow
for
my
last
charging
session
it
took
charges
from
the
box,
so
box
charge
was
empty
and
then
when
put
my
earphone
on
it
was
off
so,
hd
to
turn
on
and
after
few
minutes
it
said
low
battery
so,
am
pretty
much
sure
it
will
release
charges
if
you
don
put
it
off
while
putting
in
for
charge
when
charging
box
charge
is
finishedcustomer
service
is
not
prompt
had
to
wait
and
then
shoot
second
email
to
reach
them
not
sure
in
future
how
they
will
serve
but
can
see
they
are
trying
their
best
to
make
their
product
brand
and
wish
them
success
for
this
good
producti
am
not
sure
how
long
this
earphone
will
survive
but
it
is
pretty
quality
earphone
within
the
price
range
and
my
favorite
headphone
for
nowignore
all
the
bad
reviews
and
trust
me
this
is
quality
earphone
you
will
love
it
for
my
side,
this
earphone
worked
good
:
the
earbuds
are
honestly
quite
impressive
for
the
price
it
cancels
out
sound
well
enough
and
its
battery
last
long
enough
the
only
issue
have
with
these
headphones
is
the
sound
quality
can't
help
but
feel
that
it
sounds
somewhat
muffled
of
course
they
are
quite
cheap,
and
they
are
worth
the
price
that
being
said,
if
you're
looking
for
purely
sound
quality,
recommend
looking
elsewhere
other
than
that,
bluetooth,
battery,
and
sound
proofing
are
wonderful
if
it
had
better
sound
quality,
they'd
easily
be
five
star
earbuds
worth
much
more
than
their
current
priceedit:
changed
my
review
to
4/5
because
already
thought
the
was
little
harsh,
but
the
customer
service
was
very
kind
and
offered
refund
do
like
the
earbuds
generally,
but
they
aren't
like
the
higher
end
products
when
it
comes
to
sound
quality,
so
gave
it
somewhat
negative
review
because
the
focus
of
this
sound
device
wasn't
sound
in
my
opinion
that
does
not
make
it
bad
product
though
because
it
charges
fast,
feels
comfortable,
and
cancels
sound
well
edit:
so,
the
charging
case
won't
charge
the
right
earpiece
now
only
been
couple
months
lowered
my
review
due
to
that
and
the
marketing
shenanigansthey
really
are
great
so
far
used
them
while
running
with
no
problems
and
the
battery
life
is
excellentthe
real
reason
i'm
writing
this
review
is
to
nab
the
free
pair
of
headphones
from
the
company
they
offered
this
via
email
after
purchase
thanks
ordered
these
because
of
the
reviews
but
very
disappointed
with
comfort
and
battery
life
they
didn
even
last
hours
before
have
to
recharge
and
this
particular
order
didn
hold
the
charge
there
was
card
attached
that
won
free
set
but
never
received
it
after
going
and
registering
as
card
indicated
think
seller
gives
you
free
one
so
that
you
will
give
four
star
reviews
so
the
company
wanted
me
to
screenshot
star
rating
and
would
receive
an
extra
pair
of
headphones
sounds
great
but
waiti
can't
do
that
because
they're
mediocre
at
best
the
volume
on
the
sides
didn't
work
hardly
any
bass
comes
through
frustrated
just
can't
find
good
clear
set
of
headphone
for
calls
however,
i'd
definitely
purchase
these
again
i'm
sick
of
my
earbuds
falling
out
of
my
ear
onto
the
covid
ground
lol
seriously
though,
these
stay
in
my
ear
while
working
out,
music
is
very
clear,
doesn't
cut
out
can
walk
through
the
house
decent
distance
from
my
phone
as
well
phone
callsi
can
hear
clearlybut
sometimes
have
to
speak
so
they
can
hear
me
clearly
i'd
buy
these
again
before
my
$120
earbuds
not
bad
at
all
for
30
bucks
horrible
road
noise,
unless
you
have
an
expensive
car
which
blocks
out
all
road
noise,
driving
over
40
miles
an
hour
the
person
on
the
other
end
of
the
phone
hears
scratching/noisy
drone
of
road
noise,
your
end
is
clear
with
no
noise
less
than
40
miles
an
hour,
the
sound
on
the
other
end
is
eh
ok
know,
know,
buy
better
car
this
is
with
using
either
ear
bud
left
or
right
on
the
positive
side,
the
microphone
is
excellent
and
if
using
while
not
driving,
your
voice
is
clear
and
no
background
noise
is
heard
for
the
end
user
or
yourselfit
will
randomly
disconnect
from
the
phone,
no
warning,
just
drops
and
you
can't
reconnect
has
never
happened
with
my
other
bt
headsetsi
have
plantronics,
in
which
you
can
double
click
to
make
hands
free
call,
you
can't
with
this
headsetall
other
features,
at
the
moment,
are
excellent
great
fit,
don't
fall
out,
clear
sound
have
only
been
using
this
for
days
as
of
this
review
the
ear
buds
fit
securely
even
during
exercise
the
have
great
distance
range
from
the

sound
is
clear
battery
life
is
good
haven't
used
it
long
enough
to
run
the
battery
down
so
can't
comment
on
battery
life
the
earpiece
is
not
adjustable,
there's
no
wire
in
it,
and
i've
already
dropped
an
ear
bud
twice
from
taking
my
covid
mask
off
and
had
to
retrace
my
steps
and
have
big
ears
came
up
with
hack
to
attach
leash
to
the
ear
buds
on
the
end
of
the
earpiece
so
that
they're
connected
to
each
other
and
can't
lose

with
black

to
the
end
of
the
ear
pieces
and
put
drop
of
glue
on
the
knot
the
ear
buds
will
still
charge
with
this
attached
meanwhile,
if
i'm
sedentary,
like
on
plane
or
at
home,
can
use
them
without
the
leash
if
choose
had
little
trouble
getting
them
to
connect
to
my
phone
at
first
and
only
one
was
connecting,
but
second
or
third
time
tried
they
instantly
connected
and
worked
great
wanted
this
style
to
loop
around
my
ear
but
the
loop
for
around
your
ear
is
too
high
when
in
my
ear
as
in
if
it
fit
wrapped
around
my
ear
like
where
eyeglasses
go,
as
it
is
designed
to,
the
speaker
bud
itself
would
be
sitting
where
an
earring
goes,
below
where
it
should
be,
it
fine
and
comfortable
but
not
as
secure
tho
they
don
generally
fall
out
as
find
ideal
my
ear
holes
ha
ha
seem
especially
small
and
inear
headphones
have
always
been
challenge
think
it
would
be
problem
with
any
headphone,
they
design
one
size
fits
all
but
people
ears
are
never
one
size
fits
all
overall
for
the
price
point
these
are
pretty
cool
the
earbuds
fit
comfortably
and
stay
in
place
while
am
running
with
them
it
seems
sometimes
that
the
sound
from
each
ear
is
slightly
out
of
sync,
which
leads
to
kind
of
fuzzy
quality
at
times,
and
fairly
often
if
turn
my
head,
one
earbud
loses
connection
momentarily
wore
them
once
with
cotton
headband,
but
that
was
too
much
pressure
and
one
earbud
kept
disconnecting,
so
would
suggest
getting
ear
muffs
that
stand
off
the
ear
if
you
plan
to
use
them
in
cold
weather
the
charging
case
is
great,
but
only
stays
charged
for
about
one
use,
so
usually
keep
it
plugged
in
otherwise,
the
earbuds
seem
to
lose
battery
connection
seems
more
shaky
after
about
day
of
use/nonuse
expected
more
battery
life
and
better
connection
quality,
but
overall
it
is
not
bad
pair
of
earbuds
for
light
movement
or
if
you
can
keep
the
charger
plugged
in
would
not
recommend
these
for
long
trips
away
first
pair
received
the
left
ear
went
out
after
usesi'm
very
careful
with
my
itemsi
believe
in
second
chances
so
ordered
replacementright
ear
worked
left
ear
keeps
shutting
offnow
i'm
convinced
the
headphones
are
straight
garbage
two
pairs
in
row
i'm
out
80
and
amazon
doesn't
refund
right
away
anymorei
never
leave
reviews
but
feel
this
is
needed
for
others
who
don't
want
to
waste
their
time
these
are
the
worst
headphones
i've
purchased
off
here
read
through
many
of
the
reviews
and
am
baffled
so
many
users
say
they
are
amazingbass
isn't
even
good
for
the
one
ear
that
works
volume
on
high
for
phone
calls
still
isn't
that
loudspend
bit
more
if
you
want
better
quality
had
these
headphones
for
probably
about
three
days
before
they
started
acting
up
the
bluetooth
goes
in
and
out
in
and
out
and
you
have
to
stop
and
reconnect
them
about
every
five
minutes
needless
to
say
it
very
frustrating
especially
when
you
re
exercising
or
trying
to
listen
to
music
or
an
audiobook
save
your
money
don
suggest
these
they
sound
great,
feel
great,
and
keep
great
charge
