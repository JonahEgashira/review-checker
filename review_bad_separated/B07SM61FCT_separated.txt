je
viens
d'utiliser
le
masseur
occulaire,
j'ai
été
agréable
surpris
par
ce
masseur
en
effet
il
agit
comme
un
tensiomètre
car
la
poche
grise
situé
à
l'intérieur
se
gonfle
et
elle
compresse
en
alternance
les
tempes
et
les
paupières
c'est
un
massage
compressif
avec
une
sensation
de
chaleur
c'est
agréable
et
reposant
pour
les
yeux
en
effet
je
porte
des
lentilles
et
mes
yeux
fatigués
en
fin
de
journée
ça
je
travail
sur
écran
d'ordinateur
et
je
suis
aussi
très
souvent
sur
mon
téléphone
jai
utilisé
le
masseur
tous
les
soir
depuis
que
je
l'ai
reçu
je
suis
très
satisfait
je
le
conseil
aux
personnes
qui
sont
souvent
sur

et
qui
veulent
préserver
leurs

this
heated
massager
interested
me
because
recently
been
recommended
two
activities
to
help
with
newly
diagnosed
blepharitis
these
were
to
use
heated
eye
mask
and
also
to
perform
regular
massages
to
my
eyelids
this
appeared
to
tick
both
boxes
and
was
keen
to
give
it
goi
previously
bought
renpho
scales
which
very
happy
with
the
accompanying
app
is
great
too
so
felt
confident
in
the
brandthe
highquality
packaging
reminded
me
of
opening
an
apple
product
which
for
me
was
great
start
very
simple
contents
the
massager,
usb
charging
cable,
instructions
and
warranty
cardon
picking
up
the
massager,
it
looks
and
feels
well
made
and,
although
it's
not
particularly
light,
it's
very
comfortable
to
wearswitching
it
on
for
the
first
time
it
arrived
fully
charged,
didn
know
what
to
expect
and
the
whir
of
the
electric
motor
and
gentle
whoosh
of
the
pressure
being
released
were
quite
noticeable
however,
they
were
more
soothing
than
aggravating
the
sound
is
reassuring
and
the
ambient
background
music
is
relaxing
haven
yet
tried
pairing
it
with
bluetooth
for
my
own
music
but
that
nice
touch
will
be
investigating
lateras
for
the
massage
action
the
important
bit,
was
little
cautious
initially
the
thought
of
something
mechanical
on
my
eyes
seemed
little
unsettling
needn
have
worried
even
on
its
highest
and
warmest
setting,
it
was
very
comfortable
and
relaxed
in
no
time
as
well
as
feeling
the
massage
effect
on
my
eyes,
feel
it
gripping
and
massaging
my
temples
as
the
eye
pads
went
through
their
action
the
action
feels
strong
and
positive
and
the
heat
is
comfortable
and
comparable
to
what
previously
had
from
gel
pads
in
simple
eye
maskusing
the
controls
is
really
straightforward,
as
they
re
easily
found
and
the
clear
voice
prompts
confirm
your
selectionsi
only
few
days
in
and
undecided
about
which
mode
prefer
it
bit
of
learning
curve
as,
apart
from
their
titles,
briefest
description
and
duration,
there's
no
more
detail
like
to
know
more
as
definitely
hear
and
feel
different
massage
actions
that
small
shame
but
doesn
put
me
off
and
sure
ll
find
favourite
it
relaxing
enough
that
ve
already
fallen
asleep
mid
session,
only
to
be
awakened
by
the
end
of
session
announcementso
far
it
definitely
gets
thumbsup
and
ve
been
letting
friends
and
family
have
go
with
it
too
making
sure
to
clean
it
between
users
they
ve
all
been
positive
too
initially
one
said
how
do
you
manage
to
keep
your
eyes
open
to
get
them
massaged
erm,
you
don
thought
that
would
have
been
obvious,
but
perhaps
not
first,
these
eye
massagers
are
designed
to
massage
the
orbital
rim
not
the
eye
itselfdon
be
surprised
if
they
don
message
your
eyeballscons:the
nose
piece
might
annoy
the
noseit
might
press
too
hard
on

areas

not

she
loves
it
tech
nerd
so,
like
moth
to
flame,
if
it
got
blue
blinking
light
on
it
want
it
so
for
her
birthday
decided
to
steer
away
from
the
usual
types
of
presents
and
get
her
something
very
unique
saw
these
on
amazon
and
started
reading
about
them
there
lot
of
them
out
there
but
settled
on
this
one
because
it
had
better
reviews
when
she
opened
it,
pretty
sure
her
initial
reaction
was
wasted
money
on
whatever
the
hell
this
thing
was
she
was
clueless
about
it
because
she
the
anti
tech
one
the
yin
to
my
yang
explained
to
her
how
to
use
it,
charged
it
and
when
she
got
out
of
the
shower
made
her
put
it
onshe
had
no
idea
was
recording
her
reactions,
but
jamie
is
now
the
trophy
husband
because
she
loves
it
so
much
that
she
took
it
to
work,
let
them
test
it
out
and
now
they
bought
them
too
you
gotta
really
be
into
the
whole
woosaa
zen
thing
like
her
suppose
to
fully
enjoy
it
because
it
not
like
it
going
to
instantly
make
life
suck
less
for
you
but
she
happy
with
it
after
her
shower
she
puts
it
on
and
relaxes
with
it
she
happy,
happy
:
have
myopia
and
wear
contact
lenses
often
will
get
an
eye
fatigue,
reason
was
interested
in
this
productpros:strong
eye
massage
even
on
soft
mode
at
the
first
use,
was
suprised
how
much
pain
it
caused
to
me
after
few
use,
got
used
to
the
massage
once,
felt
asleep
which
wearing
thesethe
heat
is
very
comfortable
like
to
put
it
on
high
temperature
and
after
an
session,
feel
like
did
an
eye
saunamaterial
feels
soft
and
comfy,
plastic
feel
sturdycons:the
buttons
are
too
sensible,
would
prefer
physical
buttons,
but
once
the
mode
is
set,
it's
fine,
not
big
dealthe
speaker
isn't
very
loud,
but
treat
it
like
massager
with
an
added
function,
so
nothing
to
complain
thereoverall
this
is
great
eye
massager
with
heat
if
you
like
body
massage,
you
should
treat
your
eye
too
it
great
product
not
only
massages
my
eyes
but
also
changed
my
routine
of
putting
down
the
cell
phone
as
the
last
thing
of
the
day
to
putting
on
the
massager
as
the
last
thing
of
the
day
greatly
improved
my
sleeping
will
definitely
buy
or
more
pair
for
my
husband
bought
the
eye
massager
few
weeks
ago
and
wanted
to
use
it
for
while
before
leaving
review
ve
used
the
massager
almost
everyday,
it
has
held
up
well
and
is
very
relaxing
at
first,
the
pressure
on
your
eyes
is
hard
to
get
used
to,
and
can
cause
some
tension,
but
once
you
ve
used
twice
or
so
you
re
on
to
blissful
relaxation
there
is
also
some
noise
from
the
airbags/mechanisms
inside
the
massager,
but
not
sure
how
they
could
get
away
from
that
all
in
all
would
really
recommend
this
to
friend,
and
am
looking
forward
to
falling
asleep
with
it
on
my
face
tonight

purchased
this
product
for
my
sister
thats
severly
disabled
and
suffers
from
alot
of
sinus
and
headaches,
and
since
using
this
it
has
now
been
nearly
weeks
she
absolutely
loves
it,
as
she
no
longer
gets
headaches
or
migraines
and
shes
more
focused
and
interacts
better
in
her
activities
because
she
doesnt
suffer
from
her
eye
pressure
problems
any
more,
its
the
best
thing
ive
ever
purchased
thankyou
for
creating
an
amazing
product
definitely
will
be
buying
this
to
gift
people
as
its
life
changing
eye
massarge
una
amiga
que
tiene
migrañas
le
recomendo
mi
mujer
este
masajeador
de
ojos
suena
un
poco
raro
pero
por
probar
finalmente
nos
decidimos
comprarlo
por
el
prime
que
te
permite
devolver
el
producto
si
no
estas
satisfecho
pero
todo
lo
contrario
mi
mujer
esta
encantada
cabe
destacar
que
ella
no
tiene
migrañas
fuertes
el
masajeador
hace
unos
movimiento
alrededor
de
los
ojos
combinando
presion
un
poco
de
calor
dejandote
una
sensacion
de
bienestar
dura
minutos
se
oye
una
musica
clasica
que
te
relaja
mucho
mas
lo
recomendamos
je
n'avais
encore
jamais
testé
ce
genre
d'appareil
de
relaxation
mais
vu
mon
stress
et
surménage
actuel,
je
me
suis
dit
"pourquoi
pas"
et
je
n'en
suis
absolument
pas
déçu
cet
appareil
masseur
oculaire
vous
permet
de
vous
évader
un
instant
grâce
à
son
système
de
massage,
la
chaleur
et
aussi
la
musique
qui
relax
vous
pouvez
même
utiliser
vos
playlist
donc
c'est
un
super
achat
pour
ceux
qui
travaillent
devant
des
ordinateurs,
ont
des
maux
de
tête
ou
veulent
simplement
se
couper
du
monde
pour
se
relaxer
quelques
minutes
bought
this
for
myself
as
have
been
having
trouble
sleeping
and
thought
it
would
help
me
switch
off
my
other
devices
and
relax
bit
before
bed
it
really
easy
to
use,
fits
well
and
is
very
relaxing
the
first
secs
were
bit
strange
as
got
used
to
the
sensation
of
having
my
eyes
massaged
it
worth
riding
out
the
initial
weirdness
of
it
as
once
you
are
used
to
it
it
is
really
relaxing
the
noise
of
the
air
inflating
and
deflating
the
eye
mask
is
quite
loud,
but
if
you
have
the
music
playing
and
let
yourself
relax,
you
don
really
notice
it
after
while
it
massages
from
your
temples
across
your
eyes
and
each
mode
has
different
rhythm
ve
used
it
on
the
medium
heat
setting,
haven
tried
the
hot
setting
or
the
hard
massage
yet,
but
the
medium
pressure
is
perfect
definitely
would
recommend
this
as
something
little
bit
different
and
way
to
fully
switch
off
from
outside
distractions
bought
this
out
of
desperation
as
migraine
sufferer
and
have
never
been
so
pleasantly
surprised
by
an
online
purchaseit's
louder
than
would
like
&
the
run
time
is
shorter
than
my
greedy
butt
prefers
but
honestly,
this
really
does
helps
with
massage
pressure
points
it
doesn't
eliminate
my
migraines
but
it
does
help
make
them
more
bearablethe
buttons
are
tad
sensitive,
so
it's
easy
to
inadvertently
change
settings
mid
session
it
would
also
be
nice
to
be
able
to
activate
the
bluetooth
connect
prior
to
wearing
the
devicebut
am
totally
willing
to
overlook
any
minor
issues
have
with
the
product
because
it
genuinely
helps
me
this
eye
massager
has
surpassed
my
expectations
it
is
very
well
made
and
easy
to
use
with
touch
controlsi
have
used
it
every
day
since
receiving
it
and
it
does
work
wonders
struggle
with
tired
eyes
and
migraine
headaches
on
an
almost
daily
basis
and
this
has
been
great
helpduring
the
programme
nice
calming
music
plays
or
you
can
connect
through
bluetooth
which
havent
tried
yet
as
enjoy
the
calming
tune
it
plays
by
defaulti
can
also
turn
off
the
heat
if
wish
to
which
is
bonusall
in
all
it
is
brilliant
product
which
does
exactly
what

hace
unos
masajes
excelentes,
yo
como
soy
ingeniero
me
paso
muchas
horas
delante
del
ordenador,
me
viene
muy
bien
me
lo
suelo
poner
antes
de
dormir,
porque
además
de
para
descansar
la
vista
masajear
también
relaja
mucho
tiene
efecto
calor,
presión
música
relajante,
los
cuales
se
pueden
cambiar
en
varios
niveles
lo
recomiendo
arrived
in
great
condition
and
packaging
the
instructions
were
clear
and
although
the
buttons
were
at
first
difficult
to
find
with
my
eyes
closed,
found
the
settings
easily
changeable
the
device
provides
surprising
amount
of
warmth
and
pressure
i'm
not
sure
of
the
extent
of
the
longterm
benefits
from
using
this
device
but
it
was
comfortable
to
use
and
definitely
feels
relaxing
the
default
music
is
likely
to
get
repetitive
quickly,
but
the
bluetooth
worked
well
and
allowed
me
to
relax
with
my
own
music
the
only
major
criticism
have
is
that
the
movement
of
the
inner
parts
of
the
device
is
quite
loud,
and
will
sometimes
muffle
the
musichowever,
overall
would
recommend
the
eye
massager
it
provides
very
good
variety
of
settings
and
adjustments,
and
it
is
great
for
someone
that
wants
0minute
chill
out
at
the
end
of
tough
working
day
was
really
dubious
about
the
value
of
this
technology
and
suspected
it
would
be
gimmick,
and
end
up
in
box
somewhere
but
has
been
crazy
year,
and
for
those
of
us
wfh
without
no
chance
of
holiday,
you
can
feel
the
stress
and
eyestrain
from
the
computer
well,
can
confirm
this
works
the
heated
pads
are
relaxing
in
their
own
right,
but
the
air
pressure
massage
is
perfect
it's
definitely
helped
with
my
vision
after
long
days
or
taking
mid
day
break
my
wife
has
also
stolen
it
now
when
she
can
and
it's
helped
with
her
migraines
and
vision
can
forgive
the
device
for
being
little
on
the
noisy
side,
you
really
don't
notice
that
much
also,
the
music
isn't
brilliant,
as
it
is
coming
from
the
front
mask
rather
than
into
your
ears,
but
you
can
easily
turn
this
function
off
with
button
and
use
your
own
headset
or
earbuds
instead
we're
definitely
converts
now
to
these
devices
carve
out
little
"me
time"
in
your
life
and
pamper
yourself,
you
won't
be
sorry
recently
have
been
having
trouble
falling
asleep
and
was
searching
for
some
massager
and
this
popup
thought
to
give
it
try
and
just
loved
it
especially
the
heating
feature
the
temperature
just
feels
right
on
eyes
and
it
takes
you
to
sleeping
zone
with
music
in
the
backgroundthe
temple
massage
is
relaxing
feature
like
it
in
light
mode
though
my
partner
enjoys
it
on
bit
higher
level
⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
so
this
is
annoying
to
use,
the
buttons
are
light
so
even
mild
tough
changes
the
settings
then
you
have
to
wait
secs
to
cycle
through
againit's
not
even
that
comfortable
the
first
time
used
wasnt
sure
if
liked
it
or
it
was
uncomfortablebut
it
defintely
seems
to
help
the
first
say
out
of
times
used,
had
drifters
off
to
sleep
by
the
time
the
approx
0min
programme
had
finishedso
it
has
helpedi
tried
the
wifi
version
also,
its
exactly
the
same
just
with
remote
control
remote
is
better
but
its
an
extra
object
to
take
care
of,
and
in
the
end
got
used
to
the
akward
button
interface
there
is
an
art
to
touching
the
buttons
bought
this
device
to
help
my
blepharitis
and
dry
eyes
i've
tried
microwave
eye
pack
and
also
usb
eye
heaters,
both
of
which
have
significant
flaws
the
microwave
bag
would
be
too
hot
to
touch,
but
then
when
it's
on
it
would
cool
down
too
quickly,
and
the
usb
eye
heater
had
to
be
plugged
in
and
didn't
really
helpthis
thing
is
renpho
massager
though
is
whole
different
ball
gamewhat
love
about
it:
air
pressure
+
heat
is
brilliant,
the
perfect
setting
for
me,
very
relaxing
and
leaves
eyes
warm,
moist
and
refreshed
it
fits
perfectly,
stays
in
place
and
covers
the
whole
eye
area
the
music
is
relaxing
and
changes
to
wave
sounds
every
so
often
the
battery
lasts
maybe
sessions,
which
is
good
enough
for
me,
it
warns
you
early
when
it's
low
on
power
but
carries
on
going
the
way
it
massages
only
slight
air
pressure
on
your
eyelids,
the
massaging
really
only
happens
around
the
eye
so
it's
definitely
safethings
don't
like:
the
vibration
is
pretty
horrible,
but
you
don't
have
to
have
it
on
it's
like
fast
heart
beat,
very
stressful
in
my
opinionthings
hate:
my
device
has
hard
bump
directly
over
my
left
eyebrow,
i'm
not
sure
what
it
is
but
it
makes
the
device
very
uncomfortable
until
turn
it
on
and
the
air
pressure
cushions
it
i've
tried
moving
the
device
around
but
it
still
hurts
this
means
can't
use
the
device
without
air
pressure
the
controls
are
very
badly
designed
seeing
as
you
have
to
put
the
device
on
before
you
turn
it
on,
touch
controls
are
really
bad
idea
there
are
just
slightly
concave
touch
controls,
and
the
two
small
ones
are
almost
impossible
to
find
first
time
now
end
up
running
my
finger
very
slowly
up
towards
the
controls
and
trying
to
feel
for
the
small
buttons
so
don't
change
my
current
mode
couldn't
imagine
having
to
change
track
or
anything
like
that,
nightmareall
you
need
to
do
is
put
actual
buttons
on,
maybe
in
different
shapes
or
just
spread
them
out
bit
perhaps
should've
got
the
remote
control

je
recommande
vivement
ce
produit
et
cette
marque
je
connaissais
déjà
la
marque
renpho
ayant
acheté
une
balance
connecté
mais
un
ami
m'a
conseillé
d'acheté
ce
produit
car
je
passe
beaucoup
de
temps
sur
un
pc
et
j'ai
très
souvent
mal
au
crane
cela
fait
0jours
que
je
l'ai
acheté
et
c'est
vraiment
le
top
je
passe
0mn
par
soir
en
tête
à
tête
avec
ce
produit
et
j'ai
l'impression
d'être
au
salon
de
massage
avec
une
petite
musique
de
relaxation
déjà
intégré
dans
le
masseur
mais
il
est
bluetooth
et
vous
pouvez
mettre
également
votre
musique
j'espère
que
vous
sortirez
d'autres
produits
aussi
innovant
car
la
je
suis
bluffé
first
impression
when
getting
the
eye
massager
out
of
the
box
it
looked
and
felt
well
made
if
not
little
space
age,
but
was
keen
to
give
it
try
after
quick
read
of
the
instructions
plugged
it
in
to
charge
using
the
lead
no
plug
adaptor
provided
left
it
for
couple
of
hours
whilst
popped
out
and
it
was
ready
to
use
upon
my
returnafter
holding
the
on
button
for
few
seconds
it
came
to
life
and
you
receive
audible
directions
to
which
setting
you
are
on
placed
over
my
eyes
and
settled
on
the
automatic
setting
what
can
say
is,
it
is
different
to
any
other
heated
eye
mask
have
tried
in
the
past,
tranquil
music
starts
playing
and
then
the
eye
mask
inflates,
heats,
massages
and
vibrates
all
of
which
can
say
were
very
comfortable
and
nice
experience
after
mins
the
program
comes
to
an
end
you
are
also
advised
by
the
audible
voice
and
it
switches
offi
felt
relaxed
and
my
eyes
did
feel
refreshed
and
was
ready
for
sleepthe
downsides
it
is
little
noisy
as
it
inflates/deflates
and
massages
however,
after
few
minutes
stopped
noticing
this,
so
didn
particularly
find
it
irritatingi
have
given
the
eye
massager
0*
as
overall
really
like
it
and
as
have
said
previously
found
it
relaxing
once
got
used
to
the
sounds
and
sensations,
however,
appreciate
this
may
not
be
for
everyone
also
suffer
with
dry
eyes,
which
is
one
of
the
reasons
looked
at
this
mask
in
the
first
place
so
am
interested
to
see
if
this
helps
in
the
long
run

compré
este
masajeador
porque
después
de
tantas
horas
trabajando
frente
al
ordenador,
tenía
los
ojos
cansadísimos
y,
bueno,
la
verdad
es
que
no

gratificante
después
de
probarlo
en
varias
ocasiones
diferentes
cuenta
con
varios
modos,
así
que
se
puede

mi
favorito
es
el
de

tiene
música
bastante
relajante,
la
verdad
es
que
son
buenas

aún
así
prefería
una
relajación
más
personalizada,
¡así
que
puse

así
que
ha
sido
fácilla
mejor
compra
de
relax
que
he
hecho
en
mi
vida
received
the
eye
massager
last
night
and
couldn
wait
to
try
it
suffer
from
anxiety
and
as
result
often
struggle
to
sleep
having
read
the
reviews
from
others
thought
this
was
worth
try
it
didn
disappoint
the
operation
was
extremely
easy
to
follow
and
straightforward
allowing
you
to
change
mode
with
just
few
touches
you
are
distracted
from
any
noise
of
the
massager
by
the
soothing,
calming
music
that
you
can
switch
on
the
warmth
that
felt
around
my
eyes
helped
with
the
tension
tend
to
feel
in
that
area
and
across
my
brow
area
the
vibration
is
at
the
right
level
to
relieve
tension
but
also
be
relaxing
often
feel
that
massage
products
make
me
tense
up
but
this
did
the
opposite
feel
asleep
easily
last
night
whether
this
was
psychosomatic
or
helped
by
the
eye
massager
don
know
will
definitely
be
using
it
again
tonight
to
put
it
to
the
test
again
definitely
recommend
this
product
is
extremely
painful
on
my
temples/side
of
my
eyes
even
on
the
soft
mode
it
hurts
so
much
have
to
stop
using
it
even
let
my
mum
try
it
to
see
if
it
was
just
me
and
she
had
to
turn
it
off
too
after
using
this
everyday
for
days
of
trying
to
use
it
developed
terrible
migraine
so
won
be
using
this
product
again
also,
all
the
massage
settings
are
the
different
names
but
they
are
essentially
the
same
will
be
returning
this
omg
this
eye
massager
is
amazing
i'm
glad
took
the
chance
in
buying
thisi
sleep
like
dead
fish
and
i'm
so
so
relaxed

great

from
renpho
ll

as

and
friends
this
comment
is
based
on
my
use
of
this
product
only
wasn't
sure
about
this
at
first,
but
after
getting
used
to
it,
have
found
it
very
relaxing
and
helpful
in
resting
my
eyes,
especially
during
lockdown
when
i'm
spending
too
much
screen
time
the
controls
could
be
better
more
positive
button
for
putting
it
on
and
switching
modes
would
improve
the
device
am
constantly
accidentally
switching
modes
when
don't
want
to,
just
because
i'm
hunting
for
the
bluetooth
button
also
it
would
be
better
if
it
could
be
switched
on
in
neutral,
so
that
you
could
sort
out
bluetooth
before
starting
massage
overall,
an
enjoyable
product
and
i'm
glad
bought
it,
even
if
controls
could
be
better
this
product
has
been
life
saver
am
paramedic,
ve
been
at
the
front
line
working
long
hours
and
this
product
is
amazing
after
wearing
masks
and
ppe
dry
eyes
and
shattered
this
product
relaxes
massages
the
heat
compression
is
incredible
and
the
music
option
is
brilliant
know
someone
with
similar
product
but
this
is
the
best
on
the
market
promise
happy
to
put
my
name
to
that
ian
caddick
can
stop
using
this
amazing
massager,
and
the
music
just
sends
you
into
zen
state
even
my
partner
put
it
on
and
was
asleep
in
few
minutes
it
gives
wonderful
feeling
around
the
eyes
and
takes
the
stress
tension
away
find
with
renpho
products
are
always
top
standard
and
quality
if
you
struggle
with
tension
headaches,
eye
headaches
then
this
is
the
product
for
you
recommend
you
use
the
heat
setting
aswell
and
it
is
great
when
use
it
with
my
back/neck
and
foot
massager
by
renpho
as
well
bought
this
on
whim
in
the
sale
because
regularly
use
heat
pack
for
dry
eye
condition
and
thought
that
this
would
be
change
love
it,
it
isn't
as
hot
as
heat
pack
but
the
massage
is
incredible,
much
better
than
expected
from
machine
the
massage
on
my
temples
and
around
the
eyes
is
so
relaxing
and
like
the
accompanying
music
and
water
sounds
too
my
partner
has
started
using
it
too
purely
for
relaxation
i'm
very
glad
bought

it
pretty
good
at
what
it

it
not

it

is
in

and
the

helps
greatly

of
kneading
the

gave
me

the

definitely
recommend
this

it
is
easy
to
use,
quality
product,
beautifully
packaged
really
great
massage
devicethere
is
limitation
in
that
you
always
receive
heat
compression
on
all
of
the
modes
available
and
while
this
is
not
an
issue
to
me
personally,
it
may
be
an
issue
for
someone
with
heat
sensitivityit
has
very
strong
massage
for
those
who
need
it,
which
can
be
changed
to
softer
massage
at
the
touch
of
button,
bluetooth
works
perfect
and
always
starts
off
by
default,

quality
is
decent

don't

after
using
it
for
few
times
may
update
this
review
after
while
longer
not
sure
if
have
defective
device
as
cannot
hear
the
music
whilst
wearing
it
but
everyone
else
can
hear
it
if
in
the
same
room
as
myself
also
find
the
mechanism
so
loud
that
struggle
to
relax
great
product
ticks
all
the
boxes
relaxes
my
eye
area
,
nice

built
in

can
also
blu

ich
muss
ehrlich
zugeben,
dass
ich
nicht
daran
geglaubt
habe,
das
dieses
gerät
mich
überzeugt
bin
allerdings
positiv
überrascht,
wie
angenehm
min

ist
die
augen
werden
durch
die
wärme
der
brille
in
ein
entspannungsmodus
gebracht
durch
die
musik
,die
über

verbunden
werden
kann,
hat
man
die
möglichkeit
auch
akustisch
fürs
relaxen
zu
sorgen
durch
die
verschiedenen
modi
hat
man
die
möglichkeit
unterschiedliche
massagen
zu
wählen
wenn
es
etwas
zu
meckern
gibt,
ist
es
das
brummen
der
kleinen
motoren
allerdings
nehme
ich
das
gern
in
kauf
für
diese
wohltuende
massage
although
did
initially
like
this
product
as
it
felt
well
made
the
speaker
is
low
quality
and
low
volume
meaning
there
is
little
point
using
it
additionally
the
pre
recorded
relaxing
sounds
are
on
short
repetitive
loop,
are
crackly
and
fairly
annoying
the
heat
function
was
great
while
it
worked
but
after
weeks
stopped
working
on
the
positive
side
there
was
no
quibble
replacement
sent
out
after
made
them
aware
of
the
fault
it
really
helps
to
relax
the
muscles
around
eyes
like
the
heating
part
the
most
every
charge
can
use
for
around
programs
since
am
not
using
it
every
day
really
happy
with
the
product
love,
love,
love
this
item
bought
it
when
it
was
on
offer
as
suffer
with
headaches
&
migrainesi
usually
turn
off
the
music,
ads
heat,
vibration
&
firm
pressureit's
so
incredibly
relaxing
that
once
it
stops
&
put
it
on
againmy
brother
in
law
tried
it
&
he's
hooked
too,
which
is
glowing
recommendation
in
itself
as
he's
hard
to
pleaseoverall
if
it's
fantastic
way
to
destress
&
relax
just
need
one
for
my
feet
now
was
ok
the
problems
faced
were
that
the
controls
were
touch
sensitive
which
is
terrible
user
experience
when
you
are
wearing
the
device
also
my
battery
lost
charge
after
session
so
had
to
return
it,
tried
something
else
insteadedit:
also,
the
way
the
product
vibrates
makes
my
face
so
itchy
was
not
comfortable
at
all
amazing
product,
using
it
twice
day
and
totally
impressed
relaxing
and
great
massager
nice
gadget
nice
relaxing
experience
and
kind
of
ok
massage
for
me
too
heat
is
too
much
it
says
on
the
amazon
there
is
heat
adjustment
unit
in
the
instruction
there
is
nowhere
to
be
found
how
to
do
it
so
am
still
not
sure
if
will
not
return
it
got
this
in
black
friday
sale
and
it
was
definitely
value
for
money
get
that
same
relaxing
feeling
have
after
facial
haven
tried
it
with
headache,
not
sure
it
would
massage
enough
but
it
certainly
wouldn
do
any
harm
very
relaxing
this
is
an
absolute
awesome
piece
of
equipment
don
know
how
ve
managed
all
these
years
without
it
love
it
it
easy
to
use
and
the
only
problem
had
was
trying
to
get
the
band
to
the
right
size
to
fit
my
head
it
definitely
worth
the
money
my
eyes
feel
so
good
after
session
of
0mins
just
sit
back
and
it
does
the
work
bought
this
to
help
with
really
stingy
eyes
and
to
help
with
sleep
sadly,
the
product
helped
with
neither
problems
it
is
slightly
relaxing
to
use,
but
did
not
offer
any
relief
bought
three
massagers
one
of
them
could
be
charged
and
wasn
working
another
one
the
heat
mode
stopped
working
before
long
contacted
the
customer
service
and
was
told
to
wait
patiently
because
it
was
their
national
holiday
chased
them
again
but
received
no
reply
suffering
continuous
headaches
and
stressed
out,
this
is
amazingi
have
used
it
about
times,
and
each
time
the
feel
good
factor
last
as
few
hours
after
using
headaches
tension
lifts
lot
it
it
as
relaxing
too
i've
just
tried
it
and
am
impressed
it's
strange
because
it's
new,
but
it's
so
relaxing
feel
sleepy
now
it's
hard
to
explain
what
it
feels
like
was
imagining
those
aliens
stuck
on
the
faces
in
the
movies
fantastic
item
that
really
does
what
it
supposed
to
this
product
is
amazing,
so
relaxing
use
it
every
day
it
good
for
tired
eyes
and
headache
too
liked
it
so
much
that
bought
one
for
my
daughter
and
she
thinks
it
the
best
present
ever
bought
for
her
we
are
both
nurses,
her
in
mental
health
and
me
in
general
nursing
and
we
both
love
to
use
it
after
long
day
at
work
its
all
that
it
says
very
comfortable
and
also
helps
my
sinuses
and
the
massage
is
very
beneficial
they
arrived
in
good
time
find
them
very
relaxing
and
therapeutic
love
the
choice
of
pressure,
heat
and
the
music
highly
recommend
these
eye
pressure,
massage
with
heat
my
partner
suffers
from
headaches/migraines
and
he
been
getting
them
little
more
frequently
due
to
lockdown
and
not
being
able
to
get
to
the
osteopath
found
this
online
and
thought
we
give
it
go
and
we
were
both
surprised
at
how
good
it
actually
is
great
value
for
money
warms
your
eye
area
up
and
the
pressure
is
just
enough
on

annoying

le
soir
après
une
dure
journée
c'est
vraiment
impressionnant
comme

immédiate
quant'aux
massages
qu'il
prodigue
par

et

c'est
juste
du
bonheur
evidemment
rien
ne
remplace
un
massage

esthéticienne
mais
le
prix
n'est
pas
le
même,
c'est
donc
un
très
bon

et

ce
type

think
the
device
is
good
but
personally
found
the
device
bit
noisy
when
was
trying
to
relaxcould
bluetooth
option
to
connect
to
phone
and
listen
to
music
only
downside
to
it
is
that
when
you
go
to
take
it
on
and
off
as
the
buttons
are
just
touch
sensitive
you
can
easily
change
the
settings
by
accident
this
is
an
incredible
devise
and
life
changing
purchase
it
provides
very
relaxing
experience
through
variety
of
different
settings
bought
this
product
to
help
my
eye
strain
problem
and
it
has
helped
me
considerablyhowever,
and
i'm
not
sure
if
received
dodgy
set
but
the
heat
on
these
is
disappointingly
weak
it
rarely
even
turns
on
at
allperhaps
stars
is
little
harsh
but
"powerful
heat
massage"
was
on
the
tin
electric
eye
massagervery
nice
and
very
relaxingi
use
twice
day
got
this
for
my
hubby
as
he
needs
to
relax
more
and
this
product
does
just
that,
he
puts
it
on
every
night
has
great
chill
usually
falls
sleep
he
says
it
is
one
of
the
best
presents
have
got
him,
once
fully
charged
can
get
several
usages
before
recharging
again
vitality
mode
yes
please
could
do
with
less
noise
but
the
massage
is
top
notchthese
guy
could
give
you
more
of
the
massage
that
comes
in
the
second
half
of
vitality
mode
the
heating
feature
didn't
work
on
the
first
eye
massager
received
but
renpho
quickly
replaced
it
it's
well
made
and
provides
squeezing
motion
type
massage
that
doesn't
quite
replicate
massage
from
human
but
nevertheless,
for
the
money,
it's
very
good
product
particularly
like
that
it
massages
the
temples
as
well
as
the
eye
area
in
love
with
this
eye
massager,
all
my
family
is
using
it
everyday
got
mine
without
the
remote
and
its
still
easy
to
use
with
the
buttons
:
go
and
get
it
for
yourself
it
like
mini
spa
at
home
and
beauty
therapist
so
trust
me
:
quite
good
piece
of
equipment
the
massage
and
the
heat
is
good
but
is
super
noisyafter
couple
of
minutes
the
noise
gets
really
annoying
and
make
it
impossible
to
relax
my
wife
favourite
present
out
of
all
of
them
gifted
to
work
colleague
as
gift
as
she
was
having
anxiety
issues
at
nightshe
said
she
would
recommend
best
christmas
present
everjust
sit
back
relax
and
enjoy
the
little
finger
tips
that
massage
you
stress
away
the
product
is
very
well
made
with
high
quality
plasticwhilst
it
might
of
totally
got
rid
of
my
headache
it
certainly
did
helpas
device
for
relaxation,
amazingfound
it
so
soothing
and
relax
disappointed
of
the
motor
was
so
noisy
not
really
enjoy
for
go
to

not
match
with
calm
and
relax
music
controls
need
better
explanation
am
partially
sightedselecting
the
correct
mode
not
obvious
love
it
did
not
realize
how
relaxing
this
eye
massager
is
until
tried
it
great
for
quick
power
nap
this
is
great
product
and
very
relaxing
it
is
quite
noisy
and
mine
came
without
the
remote
advertised
so
am
giving
stars
for
that,
however
if
it
was
quieter
and
the
remote
did
come
included,
this
would
defo
be
0/0
star
product
and
very
relaxing
very
relaxing,
comfortable
and
very
good
at
taking
the
strain
out
of
your
eyes
definitely
recommended
for
tired
eyes
works
really
well
evens
as
pamper
gift
very
easy
to
use,
relaxing
to
it
best
while
listening
to
music
from
ur
foneit
little
bit
big
but
that
nothing
too
muchit
release
the
tension
of
my
eyes
so
much
have
dry
eyes
and
really
like
this
product
it
provides
relief
for
headaches
aswell,
love
the
heat
function
however
the
only
down
side
for
me
is
that
it
quite
loud
love
this
product
it
helps
me
relax
my
tired
eyes
specially
it
has
added
music
i've
ordered
these
goggles
for
my
husband
as
he
suffers
from
headache
after
working
long
hours
with
his
computerhe
absolutely
loves
them
they
are
well
built
and
have
several
modes
+/
heat
+/

it
works
well
and

well
however
it
could
be
more
gentle
very
good
eye
massager
quite
impressed
with
the
build

and
your
eyes
feel
complete
relaxed
after
using
it
good

product,
slightly
noisy
but
not
big
issue
gentle
massages
the
scalp
and
helped
me
with
my
headaches
recommend
it
ordered
as
gift
no
issues
with
the
item
itself
but
was
clearly
return
with
missing
usb
cable
have
disinfected
great
for
relaxation
and
tension
headache
due
to
using
computer
all
day
but
don't
expect
to
pay
full
price
for
second
hand
item
this
eye
massager
is
great
and
comfortable
always
use
it
just
before
go
to
sleep,
the
only
downside
for
me
is
no
battery
indicator
so
sometimes
use
it
half
way
through
or
few
minutes
in
it
tells
me
low

is

this
item
its
brill
massage
to
ur
eye
area
so
relaxing
really
like
this
item
good
value
everything
works
really
well,
the
touch
sensitive
controls
are
extremely
sensitive
and
get
little
getting
used
to,
the
confirmation
voice
announcement
is
clear
but
can
lag
behind
little
if
buttons
pushed
in
quick
succession
don
usually
write
reviews
but
after
using
this
eye
massager
for
just
over
week
it
done
my
eyes
the
world
of
good
suffer
with
really
bad
swallowing
round
my
eyes
and
bad
headaches
the
swallowing
has
gone
down
loads
haven
had
headache
since
started
using
this
bought
it
to
help
me
relax
and
sleep
and
it
does
love
this
and
so
does
my
husband
suffer
with
headaches
and
stress
eyes
after
using
this
have
to
say
it
feels
amazing
heavenly
works
great
,
only
negative
is
buttons
so
sensitive
that
when
using
and
to
set
mode,
heat,
pressure
etc
have
to
do
it
few
times
as
it
either
goes
past
or
starts
too
soon
could
well
be
me
though
love
them
very
relaxing
great
product
easy
to
use
,
very
happy
with
my
purchase

just
what
doctor
ordered
best
thing
have
boughti
suffer
with
tension
headaches
and
migraines
and
this
was
wellcome
relief
to
try
have
constant
nasal
and
sinus
congestion,
and
regular
headaches
usually
per
week
have
only
used
it
three
times
so
far,
but
this
product
seems
to
help
the
massage
action
with
heat
around
the
eye,
temple,
and
nasal
region
is
clearing
my
nasal
passages
and
the
first
thing
want
to
do
after
using
the
product
is
blow
my
nose
accordingly
last
night
slept
quite
well
as
my
nasal
passages
were
clear
enough
for
nose
breathingperhaps
most
excitedly,
see
this
product
as
being
relaxation
benefit
for
some
not
all
people
on
the
autism
spectrum
/
asperger's
during
meltdowns
find
comfort
in
applying
pressure
in
the
eye
region
see
this
product
being
benefit
during
stressful
situation
/
meltdown
the
application
of
pressure
and
heat
should
distract
from
the
cause
of
the
meltdown,
and
an
effective
way
to
shutout
the
outside
world
by
completely
blocking
visual
stimulus,
and
to
refocus
auditory
and
touch
stimulus
back
to
the
massage
unit,
and
away
from
whatever
external
stimulus
triggered
the
meltdownthe
only
negative
is
have
large
head
circumference,
so
the
head
band
feels
very
tight
on
me,
and
guess
the
other
thing
the
buttons
on
the
side
can
be
little
tricky
to
find
when
you
are
quite
literally
feeling
for
them
in
the
dark
it
can
be
easy
to
press
the
wrong
control,
but
this
is
just
case
of
getting
used
to
things
just
another
or
0cm
an
inch
more
adjustable
on
the
headband
for
people
with
large
heads
would
make
this
idealoverall
am
extremely
impressed
with
the
build
quality
the
unit
is
very
sturdy,
and
comes
with
wellwritten
instructions
am
extremely
happy
with
this
purchase
love
this
&
felt
the
benefit
on
my
dry
eyes
the
only
down
side
is
the
noise
after
bit
its
annoying
&
feels
like
you
re
having
your
tyre
pressures
done
very
pleased
with
this
read
all
the
reviews
before
purchasing
found
them
all
to
be
correct
very
nice
and
relaxing
love
this
thing
this
eye
mask
is
brilliant
it
help
my
dry

product
just
makes
me
feel
omg

wish
could
know
it
earlier
totally
opens
my
new
world
these
are
noisy
even
with
the
internal
music
but
if
you
use
noise
cancelling
bluetooth
headphone
with
soothing
music,then
they
are
fab
perfect
rest
for
the

because

few
months
ago
replaced
faulty
fitbit
scale
with
renpho
scale
and
was
really
impressed
by
the
quality
and
usability
of
scale
from
company
frankly
has
never
heard
of
recently
went
to
their
website
and
saw
they
had
this
new
eye
massager
and
as
have
both
stressful
job
and
suffer
frommigraines
thought
give
it
go
and
to
be
honest
it
quite
surprising
piece
of
tech
the
manual
is
bit
light
on
details
but
out
of
the
box
you
simply
put
it
on
and
turn
it
on
and
wow
what
weird
and
pleasant
feeling
the
massage
is
both
an
eye
which
sounds
weird
but
also
temple
massage
and
very
soothing
it
bit
like
real
massage
in
that
it
provides
pressure
and
then
release
the
initial
massage
takes
minutes
but
there
are
longer
ones
it
also
heats
up
but
not
all
settings
have
the
heat
mode
looking
forward
to
trying
few
more
of
the
settings
but
genuinely
am
enjoying
this
new
and
interesting

my
first
time
using
it
was
with
the
kids
around
don't
do
this
to
really
get
the
most
out
of
your
eye
massager,
make
sure
you
are
resting
and
no
one
can
distract
you
now
when
the
kids
are
in
bed,
put
on
the
eye
massager
and
it
forces
me
to
relax
because
it
is
covering
your
eyes,
you
aren't
tempted
to
check
your
phone
or
watch
tv
you
really
have
to
just
sit
down
and
relax,
which
is
perfect
for
people
who
always
have
'to
do'
list
and
never
take
minutes
to
relaxi
loved
the
gentle
pressure
it
places
on
different
parts
of
your
eye
and
temple
area
particularly
loved
having
my
temples
massaged
there
are
different
settings,
but
like
the
'sleep'
setting
the
most
as
it
is
so
relaxing
you
can
also
adjust
the
temperature,
which
means
in
summer
you
can
turn
the
heat
off
and
in
winter
warm
up
your
eyes
with
the
heat
on
the
only
thing
didn't
like
at
first
was
the
mechanical
sound
the
massager
makes
when
it's
increasing
the
pressure,
but
then
found
the
'puff'
sound
of
air
pressure
being
released
made
me
go
into
deeper
relaxation
after
few
goes
got
used
to
the
mechanical
sound
and
it
didn't
bother
me
also,
don't
wear
eye
makeup
while
using
the
massager
it's
best
to
use
with
clean
face
so
you
don't
dirty
the
eye
pads,
but
these
look
easy
to
clean
anyway
like
all
new

improve
my
health,

lo

está

es

around

area
even
after
multiple
uses

modeso
gave
it
to
my
partner,
he
doesn

the

and
found

you

really
wanted
to
like
this
as
work
at
computer
all
day
and
get
tired
eyes,
and
normally
love
renpho
products
but
not
this
specific
one
find
the
buttons
much
too
sensitive
and
would
accidentally
change
the
mode
just
by
trying
to
adjust
the
machine
on
my
face
also
tried
to
connect
bluetooth
to
it
but
every
time
tried
to
adjust
the
sound
it
would
disconnect
and
then
couldn
even
get
the
machine
music
to
turn
back
unless
shut
the
machine
off
and
restarted
it
the
buttons
are
just
way
too
glitchy
see
that
there
is
different
model
that
has
remote
instead
of
buttons
on
the
machine
and
suggest
trying
that
model
insteadi
really
liked
the
heat
and
have
no
complaints
on
that
pressure
wise,
it
is
good
but
when
it
filled
with
air
it
would
pinch
the
area
around
my
eyes
and
felt
like
was
getting
small
shock
not
sure
if
the
material
was
pinching
my
skin
but
it
definitely
makes
me
little
nervous
using
it
so
this
will
be
going
back
me

schnell

und
kam

hochwertigen

anfangs
war
ich
etwas
skeptisch,
ob
ich
mich
wirklich
mit
diesem
gerät
entspannen
kann
ich
bin
mutter
von
zwei
kindern,
deshalb
ist
mit
entspannung
im
alltag
sehr
wichtig
das
gerät
könnte
ein
bisschen
weicher
und
komfortablerer
sein
und
das
geräusch
beim
massieren
könnte
leiser
sein,
dennoch
kann
ich
eine
empfehlung
für
das
gerät
aussprechen,
durch
die
musik
und
wärme
bzw
durch
das
massieren
kann
ich
vollkommen
abschalten,
die
geräusche
nimmt
man
nach
einiger
zeit
überhaupt
nicht
mehr
wahr
und
auch
die
augen
gewöhnen
sich
nach
einiger
zeit
an
die
maske
ich
möchte
das
gerät
nicht
mehr
missen
die
bluetooth
verbindung
des
geräts
funktioniert
sehr
schnell
und
einfach,
sowie
auch
einstellungen
die
man
per
einfachen
knopfdruck
vornehmen
möchte
einziges
manko
ist
das
bei
der

alles
auf

ist,
das
könnte

hervor
rufen

vibrates,

and
inexpensive

exactly

my
expectations
not

high

quality
yet
easy
set
upcons:
controls
are
very
difficult
to
navigate
when
you're
wearing
the
device
due
to
all
the
controls
being
similar
and
placed
close
together
constantly
found
myself
adjusting
the
wrong
setting
and
having
to
cycle
trough
to
find
the
correct
one
the
built
in
music
is
almost
pointless
since
the
devices's
mechanics
are
louder,
wish
could
disable
the
music
setting
altogether
device
can
slip
off

aunque
recomiendo
que
cuando
el

esté
en
el
parpado
de
abajo
se
levanten
los
ojos
como
mirando
al

sin
abrirlos

relax
total
received
this
eye
massager
from
renpho
to
test
and
review
what
follows
is
my
own
opinion
the
eye
massager
is
packaged
extremely
well,
although
would
recommend
putting
sticker
or
some
sort
of
safety
seal
on
the
bottom
of
the
box
to
0%
guarantee
that
the
item
is
new
upon
opening
the
package,
was
greeted
with
strong
smell
of
cheap
plastic/rubber
this
smell
has
somewhat
dissipated
after
use,
however
some
of
it
still
lingers
and
would
highly
recommend
renpho
to
fix
in
any
future
revisions
the
smell
can
be
overwhelming,
especially
for
something
that
sits
on
your
face
right
next
to
your
nose
did
find
the
charging
port
to
be
at
weird
angle
and
initially
struggled
with
plugging
it
in
to
be
charged
the
heat
and
air
pressure
functions
are
relaxing,
but
overall
found
the
device
to
really
pinch
my
nose
and
give
me
headache
after
using
not
sure
if
the
headache
was
from
the
massage
itself
or
the
smell
of
the
new
device
found
the
device
pretty
loud,
but
playing
music
using
the
bluetooth
function
does
help
it
is
very
easy
to
use
the
device
and
it
starts
instantly
once
you
turn
it
on
wish
the
straps
were
longer
or
had
the
ability
to
detach
one
side
for
when
you
are
using
the
device
laying
down
as
it's
tight
around
my
head
overall,
think
the
device
is
relaxing
and
did
depuff
my
eye
area
after
use
and
feel
relaxed
after
use
it
reminds
me
of
massage
chair
would
have
given
0/0
stars,
however
given
the
odor
and
headache
after
use
could
only
justify
0/0
interesting
contraption,
and
strange
but
in
good
way
it's
never
gotten
rid
of
headache,
but
it
makes
me
fall
asleep
after
only
minutes
the
soft
touch
buttons
are
close
together,
and
you
don't
know
what
you're
pressing
while
wearing
this
thing
but,
you
get
used
to
it,
and
it
feels
great
on
the
eyes
with
the
heat
and
vibration
functions
new,
it
generally
lasts
uses
0x
minutes=
hour
before
needing
recharge
there's
lot
going
on
under
the
plastic
housing
it
has
an
air
pump,
motors,
heating
element,
and
who
knows
what
else
pretty
interesting
it
feels
nice
on
tired
eyes

with
the
working
at

situation,
found
was
staring
at
the
computer
screen
much
more
than
used
to,
so
thought
would
try
out
an
eye
massager
to
see
if
it
would
alleviate
some
stress
was
feeling
on
the
eyesto
be
honest,
was
not
expecting
much
at
the
start,
but
after
using
it
for
the
past
week
or
so,
think
it
actually
helps
my
initial
concern
was
air
filled
bags
pushing
on
the
eyeball
can
be
good
right
think
have
now
proven
myself
wrong
in
that
regard
as
ve
found
feel
more
refreshed
after
each
use
and
bit
more
rested
don
feel
pain
on
my
eyes
after
using
the
massager,
and
think
it
also
helps
to
move
the
moisture
around
the
eyesthe
eye
massager
feels
decently
built,
and
has
good
hinge
system
that
should
mean
it
fits
most
heads
mine
is
quite
big
and
it
fit
mine
the
area
that
touches
the
eye
believe
is
fake
leather
type
material
which
is
easy
to
clean
after
use
use
tissue
for
me,
the
amount
of
pressure
and
the
heat
are
at
good
level
one
thing
that
could
be
improved
is
the
audio
quality
or
just
being
able
to
switch
it
off
completely,
but
don
see
it
being
an
issue
as
it
doesn
affect
my
massagei
didn
try
connecting
it
to
my
phone
for
music
and
don
intend
to
as
its
just
massaging
tool
for
me,
but
believe
that
option
is
thereoverall
happier
with
the
purchase
than
thought
would
be,
however
still
little
wary
that
its
on
my
eyes
but
this
thought
will
probably
go
away
with
more
usage/trust
of
the
massager
recommend
it
to
people
looking
for
an
eye
massager
was
skeptical
at
first
about
the
product,
but
on
my
first
test
didn't
even
notice
when
dozed
off
just
woke
up
the
next
morning
with
it
right
next
to
my
pillow,
so
it
definitely
helped
me
relaxthe
pressure
varies
in
levels
and
it
can
get
surprisingly
strong,
which
satisfies
me
lot
overall
would
recommend
the
product
if
you
need
to
relax
and
if
you
suffer
from
headaches
or
just
want
to
relaxthe
few
downsides
are:
there
is
some
noise
while
the
product
is
in
use
nothing
that
disturbed
me
but
definitely
there's
some
noise
like
air
compressing
and
releasing,
hissing,
and
some
sort
of
rumble
of
the
product
doing
its
magic
some
people
might
dislike
that
the
fit
is
not
0%
perfect
in
me
i'm
not
sure
if
it
is
too
small
or
too
big
for
my
face
but
it
doesn't
sit
perfect
again,
nothing
that
is
huge
deal,
since
fell
asleep
while
using
it
so
think
it
is
working
non
avevo
mai
usato
un
massaggiatore
oculare
prima
ora
in

mia
ed
ero
un
po
scettico
nonostante
ciò,
il
mio
pregiudizio

ritrovo

di

al
fatto

grazie
alla

sich

bought
this
one
for
my
kids
as
they
have
been
staring
at
screens
for
too
long
then
we
realized
that
this
is
not
one
size
fit
all
product
it
doesn't
fit
my
kids,
they
can't
feel
the
vibration
or
pressure,
only
the
heat
it
does
not
fit
me
well
around
the
nose
area,
but
the
sides
are
good
it
fits
my
husband
perfectly
but
he
think
the
power
is
not
strong
enough
bought
this
one
as
this
is
the
one
with
the
highest
rate
on
amazon
maybe
the
fitness
issue
is
the
reason
that
could
not
appreciate
it
as
much
as
the
others

consigliato

almost

decent
massage
comes
to
the
tip
of
perhaps
being
too
much,
but
unlike
other
reviews
didn't
find
it
painful
at
all
expected
something
worse,
but
great
from
the
startheating
feature
is
so
relaxing
on

use

so
this
has
been
excellent
to
get
my
eyes
to
relaxthe
sound
is
not
great
one
song
it
plays
is
tinny
and
annoying
just
discovered
you
can
change
to
an
ocean
wave
sound,
which
is
richer
and
much
more
relaxing
the
connection
to
your
phone
is
easy,
but
sound
quality
is
not
good
best
to
just
enjoy
it
in

highly

je
l'utilise

et
sans

cela

le

est
fort

pas
douloureux,
j'ai
vu
un

dès
la
première
utilisation,
combiné
à
mes
gouttes
oculaires,
que
je
mets
avant
et
après
le

j'adore
cet
appareil
qui
repose
vraiment
mes

douloureux
au
quotidien
ras
au

davvero
eccezionale
in
genere
sono
una
persona
piuttosto
nervosa
per
me
è
difficilissimo
rilassarmi,
ma
devo
dire
che
appena
provato
questo
prodotto
sono
subito
entrata
in
uno
stato
di
pieno
relax
soddisfacente
massaggi
sono
eseguiti
molto
bene
seguono
la
forma
del
contorno

se
l'apparecchio
è
ben
posizionato
il
calore
può
aiutare
anche
in

di

concentrato
alle
tempie
ci
sono
vari
programmi
si
può
scegliere
la

il
calore,
la
vibrazione,
se
attivare
con

la
musica

meno,
si
può
anche
regolare

davvero
un
dispositivo
molto
moderno

con
un
ottimo
rapporto
qualità
prezzo
l'ideale
per
riposare
propri
occhi
dopo
una
giornata
passata
davanti
al
computer
sono
davvero
molto
felice
di
aver
scoperto
questo
prodotto
gestern
kam
die
lieferung
von
amazon
mit
dem
bestellten
augenmassagegerät
genau
zum
richtigen
zeitpunkt,
da
ich
unter
wetterbedingter
migräne
litt
nicht
extrem,
aber
lästig
nachdem
das
gerät
aufgeladen
war,
habe
ich
es
sofort
ausprobiert:
ich
bin
begeistert
sehr
wohltuend,
sehr
entspannend,
wunderbar
erholsam
das
gerät
ist
einfach
zu
bedienen
auch
ohne
fernsteuerung
und
macht
einen
soliden
und
wertigen
eindruck
wenn
mein
kopf
etwas
größer
wäre
und
meine
augen
ein
bisschen
weiter
auseinander,
dann
wäre
es
wirklich
perfekt,
aber
da
es
keine
maßanfertigung
ist
und
auf
viele
köpfe
passen
muss,
möchte
ich
nicht
meckern
der
effekt
ist
trotzdem
grandios
ich
empfinde
es
auch
nicht
als
zu
schwer
nach
ca
anwendungen
seit
gestern
musste
es
wieder
aufgeladen
werden,
das
bekommt
man
ganz
praktisch
während
der
anwendung
von
einer
freundlichen
frauenstimme
mitgeteilt:
low
power,
please
charge
ich
bin
froh,
dieses
gerät
gekauft
zu
haben
und
kann
es
eigentlich
uneingeschränkt
weiterempfehlen
no
he
quedado
contenta
con
la
compra,
de
hecho
voy
devolverlo
las
gafas
no
se
adaptan
mi
fisionomía,
tal
vez
porque
tengo
la
cabeza
un
poco
más
grande
de
lo
normal,
el
masaje
en
las
sienes
no
me
lo
da
en
las
sienes
la
presión
de
los
ojos
tampoco
encaja
bien,
con
lo
que
tampoco
noto
el
alivio
que
esperaba
es
una
pena
porque
la
idea
es
buena
si
encaja
bien
con
la
medida
de
tu
cabeza
debe
ser
muy
placentero,
pero
en
mi
caso
no
ha
resultado
ser
así
also,
nachdem
ich
dieses
produkt,
jetzt
einige
wochen
fast
täglich
zum
spätnachmittag
benutze,
muss
ich
positiv
feststellen,
das
meine
sehkraft
der
augen
sich
gebessert
haben
das
sichtfeld
ist
nicht
mehr
so
verschwommen
weiterhin
leide
ich
auch
unter
trockene
augen,
auch
hier
ist
eine
besserung
eingetreten
das
angestrengte
sehen,
im
tv
oder
auch
am
laptop,
wie
auch
beim
lesen
ich
lese
viel,
auch
hier
komme
ich
mit
dem
sehen
besser
klar,
als
vor
der
nutzung
des
gerätes
häufiges
tränen
der
augen
und
verschwimmen
der
schrift,
des
bildes
etc
zum
gerät,
die
vibrationsstellen
an
den
augen
kommen
genau
an,
und
sind
nach
meiner
ansicht
genau
dimensioniert
alles
in
allem,
bereue
ich
diesen
kauf
nicht
und
kann
das
gerät
guten
gewissens
empfehlen
für
menschen,
deren
augen
täglich
sehr
gefordert
werden
zb
arbeit
am
pc
ist
dies
eine
gute
idee,
da
es
die
gesamte
muskulatur
um
die
augen
herum
entspannt
die
maske
hilft
auch
insgesamt
sich
durch
die
massage
und
wärmefunktion
zu
entspannendas
produkt
macht
einen
hochwertigen
eindruck
die
bedienung
ist
fast
selbsterklärend,
es
liegt
aber
natürlich
auch
eine
anleitung
beiein
stern
abzug,
da
es
anfangs
leicht
nach
kunststoff
riecht
man
die
geräusche
der
pumpen
deutlich
wahrnimmt
aber
wenn
man
dabei
musik
hört,
ist
völlig
ok
build
quality:the
renpho
eye
massager
is
solid,
with
thick
strap,
durable
plastic
eye
shield,
and
comfortable
pleather
eye
mask
the
strap
is
thick
and
flexible
the
massager
has
some
heft
to
it
definitely
no
toypackaging:high
quality,
wellpacked
and
secured
there
should
be
no
worry
of
the
item
coming
damaged
it
is
tightly
packed
in
foam
material
and
the
shell
is
covered
in
protective
plastic
the
back
of
the
box
has
many
product
details
neatly
laid
out
reminds
me
of
smartphone
packaginguse
&
functionality:to
put
it
simply,
it
works
after
full
cycle
about
minutes,
the
renpho
eye
massager
leaves
my
eyes
feeling
refreshed
upon
my
first
use,
was
little
bit
uncomfortable,
as
my
eyes
were
prodded
gently,
to
the
sound
of
zen
music
repeatedly
but
when
took
the
mask
off,
noticed
relieved
feeling
in
my
eye/temple
area
as
someone
who
suffers
from
dry
eyes
and
spends
lot
of
time
staring
at
screen,
the
eye
massager
is
nice
to
have
especially
like
it
at
nighttime,
before
bedthe
massager
has
many
functions,
including
adjustable
heat
and
pressure
settings
as
had
mentioned,
the
device
also
has
speakers
which
play
zen
music
while
the
device
works
didn't
think
i'd
care
for
this,
but
it's
certainly
preferable
to
listening
to
the
dull
droning
of
the
motors
as
they
press
down
on
your
eyeballsno
matter
how
adjust
the
strap,
it
always
seems
to
slide
down
and
press
on
the
bridge
of
my
nose,
which
makes
it
difficult
to
breathe
through
my
nose
in
order
to
position
the
massager
just
right,
it
sort
of
rests
on
my
nose,
which
creates
the
issue
it
seems
that
the
machine
is
bit
too
large
it
would
be
preferable
if
there
were
more
of
divet
for
the
nosefinal
thoughts:it
works
well
and
i'm
glad
to
own
this
machine
it's
very
portable
the
battery
life
seems
quite
good,
considering
how
much
power
the
massager
needs
to
function
you'll
get
multiple
uses
before
you
have
to
charge
it
it
even
has
bluetooth,
although
haven't
made
use
of
this
featureit
does
what
it
was
designed
to
do,
and
is
an
attractive,
high
quality
productyou
won't
be
disappointed
at
this
price
point
je
me
suis
procurée
ce
masque
pour
relaxer
mes
yeux
après
de
longues
heures
devant
écran,
les
décongestionner
le
matin
et
peutêtre
aussi
espérer
que
ça
réduise
un
peu
les
rides
au
passage
:
finalement,
je
utilise
pour
endormir
sérieusement
je
endors
après
quelques
minutes,
même
si
je
fais
ça
juste
pour
relaxer
mes
yeux
en
plein
aprèsmidi
et
que
je
ai
pas
particulière

bémol,
enlèverais
bien
le
mode
musique
qui
enclenche
automatiquement
et
qu
il
faut
ôter
en
appuyant
plusieurs
fois
sur
le
bouton
je
ferais

met
la

si
on
en
envie
ai
réveillé
mon
conjoint
hier
avec
cette
musique
qui
part
sans
qu
on
la
demande
sinon,
je
trouve
cet
appareil
vraiment
génial
et
je
le
conseille
tout
ceux
qui
veillent
relaxer,
ich
muss
sagen,
das
augenmassagegerät
von
renpho
hat
meine
erwartungen
übertroffenich
habe
oft
mit
kopfschmerzen
und
brennenden,
müden
und
geschwollenen
augen
zu
tun
also
dachte
ich
mir,
ich
probiere
es
mal
aus
der
hohe
preis
hat
mich
erstmal
irritiert,
aber
hier
steckt
schon
einiges
an
technik
drin
und
die
verarbeitung
ist
sehr
gut
und
hochwertigdas
gerät
an
sich
ist
recht
schwer,
das
stört
aber
nicht
weiterjetzt
aber
zum
wichtigen
teil
der
rezension:
ich
hätte
nicht
gedacht,
dass
die
massagefunktion
sooo
gut
ist
tatsächlich
ist
es
eine
massage
der
stirn,
augen
und
schläfen
und
die
wichtigen
punkte
werden
gut
getroffen
der
druck
ist
schön
fest
und
die
musik
und
wärmefunktion
runden
das
ganze
abes
gibt
verschiedene
modi,
von
entspannung
bis
vitalitymode
ist
also
für
jeden
bedarf
was
dabeieinen
stern
abzug
gibt
für
die
doch
recht
lauten
brummgeräusche
das
lässt
sich
zwar
kaum
vermeiden,
aber
ist
etwas
störend
finde
ich
ottimo
massaggiatore
oculare
prima
di
recensire
ho
atteso
due
settimane
per
comprendere
riuscire
valutare
al
meglio
le
peculiarità
posso
confermare
le
tante
recensioni
positive,
diversi
tipi
di
massaggi,
più
meno
intensi,
musica
rilassante,
insomma
un
ottima
soluzione
per
alleviare
lo
stress
da
studio
lavoro
es
simplemente
fenomenaltrabajo
todo
el
dia
frente
al
ordenador,
ya
uso
gafas
de
aumento
con
proteccion
azul
anti
reflejos,
sufro
de
migrañas
este
producto
simplemente
ha
sido
la
salvacion
en
mis
nochesal
llegar
casa
lo
uso,
veces
quedan
mis
ojos
mi
cara
como
nuevo
super
recomendable
me
ha
gustado
muchísimo
al
principio
no
le
veía
la
gracia,
pero
ahora
busco
el
rato
para
ponérmelo,
me
relaja
los
dolores
de
migraña
de
ojos
por
ponerle
alguna
pega,
es
que
no
recuerde
la
configuración
que
le
pones,
ya
que
mi
favorito
es
el
modo
sleep
sin
calor
cada
vez
que
lo
enciendo
tengo
que
ponerlo
de
nuevo
otra
cosa
también
es
que
me
estoy
quedando
medio
dormida
justo
se
acaba,
me
gustaría
que
empezase
de
nuevo
sin
tener
que
encenderlo
cada
vez,
pero
entiendo
que
igual
esto
es
por
razones
de
salud,
que
no
se
deba
hacer
el
masaje
mas
tiempo
de
minutos
lo
recomendaría
sin
ninguna
duda,
para
los
ojos
cansados,
migrañas,
simplemente
para
relajarse

amazing
product
saw
lot
of
people
say
they
use
it
for
migraines,
which
dont
have
but
use
it
for
fun
cause
love
personal
attention
and
massages
and
this
is
perfect
for
me
bit
loud
but
its
the
mechanic
so
dont
think
it
could
have
been
quieter
and
you
can
play
your
own
music
via
bluetooth
which
is
amazing
was
really
skeptical
paying
0$
for
product
that
doesn
do
alot
but
this
is
worth
every
penny
took
couple
of
use
to
figure
out
all
the
buttons
but
after
day
the
use
is
easy
bought
it
while
being
quarantined
with
my
family
and
they
all
joke
that
they
want
to
steal
it
from
me
cause
they
all
love
it
use
it
minutes
before
bed
and
it
perfect
especially
like
the
timer
on
it
so
you
can
choose
if
you
wanna
stay
or
minutes
on
it
without
worrying
about
how
much
time
you
stay
under
that
thing
only
thing
after
minutes
on
soft
pressure
your
head
might
start
to
hurt
from
the
constant
pressure
so
id
say
this
product
is
best
used
for
minutes
anyway
im
so
happy
love
it
la
verdad,
al
principio
estaba
yo
un
tanto
escéptica
ante
la
funcionalidad
el
beneficio
del
aparato,
pero
he
de
decir
que
estoy
gratamente
sorprendida
porque
funciona
de
verdad
muy
bien
aparte
de
los
programas
estándard,
se
puede
regular
individualmente
la
intensidad
de
los
masajes
del
calor,
incluso
desactivar
el
calor
despues
de
un
masaje,
la
sensación
de
relax
es
máxima,
tanto
que
en
ocasiones
te
quedas
dormido
el
aparato
tiene
un
buen
acabado
da
la
impresión
de
ser
de
calidad,
parece
robusto,
además
de
cómodo
de
utilizar
una
grata
sorpresa,
estamos
encantados
detente
was
surprised
at
how
easy
this
was
to
use
pair
with
your
phone
via
bluetooth
for
your
own
music
or
listen
to
the
soothing
sounds
that
come
with
it
am
looking
forward
to
using
the
heat
option
in
the
winter
as
my
sinuses
often
bother
me
in
the
night
bet
this
would
be
good
item
for
migraine
sufferers
as
well
it
massages
the
temple
area
nice
and
firmly
and
relieves
eye
stress
and
strain
was
bit
skeptical
as
to
whether
would
enjoy
this,
but
really
enjoyed
the
feeling
and
found
it
soothing
it
rechargeable
too
so
no
worrying
about
buying
batteries
all
the
time
give
it
try
the
renpho
eye
massager
is
basically
great
device
especially
for
someone
who
has
fatigue
and
sleep
issuespackaging
everything
you
need
is
complete
it
has
microusb
cable
and
you
just
have
to
plug
it
in
the
side
holes
for
charging
it
only
takes
hours
to
chargephysical
attributes
it
is
very
portable
and
also
foldable
which
makes
it
very
handy
and
compact
personally
bring
it
when
travel
and
have
gone
the
habit
of
taking
it
with
me
wherever
go
it
is
safe
to
carry
it
around
you
moreover,
the
way
it
fits
and
contours
the
face
is
very
easy
as
it
comes
with
an
adjustable
strap
the
texture
that
seats
on
your
face
is
nice
leather
material
overall,
it
is
not
heavy
to
wearfeatures
it
has
five
features
that
work
differently
according
to
the
settings
that
you
prefer
it
can
go
from
to
fifteen
minutes
you
just
have
to
tap
the
right
side
button
for
this
at
first,
was
bit
cautious
because
of
the
heat
and
vibration
but
eventually,
got
used
to
it
it
also
comes
with
sound
to
help
you
ease
yourself
while
using
it
the
good
thing
is
you
can
connect
it
to
your
phone
to
play
your
own
music
it
doesn't
give
high
definition
sound,
but
it
does
the
job
the
motion
of
pressure
that
it
does
is
also
very
helpfuldoes
it
to
the
job
yes
it
helped
with
my
sleep
issues,
but
don't
expect
that
it'll
solve
everything
straight
away
it
is
very
helpful
device
to
get
yourself
feel
pampered
and
relaxed
it
helped
me
ease
in
to
have
better
sleep
it
provides
good
acupressure
and
could
feel
that
the
blood
flow
is
better
after
using
it
moreover,
it
is
very
easy
to
usedisadvantage
the
first
time
tried
it,
was
bit
scared
because
of
the
vibration,
heat
and
sound
produced
altogether
but,
eventually
get
the
hang
of
iti
have
always
purchased
renpho
products
and
have
always
been
impressed
with
their
products
it
is
good
quality
and
very
affordable
this
mask
is
very
well
put
together
the
massage
mode
is
bit
more
pressure
than
was
expecting
doesn't
cause
any
pain
but
is
very
noticeable
the
heat
function
can
be
raised
or
lowered
to
your
liking
the
blue
tooth
seems
to
work
but
considering
the
mask
turns
off
after
minutes
maximum
time
it
can
be
distracting
when
listening
to
audiobooks
would
really
like
to
be
able
to
disable
the
music
on
the
other
functions
otherwise
very
good
product
and
has
made
noticable
difference
for
dry
eye
condition
bought
this
product
because
have
some
swelling
under
my
eyes
and
thought
it
may
work
to
reduce
puffiness
i've
never
been
one
to
think
that
machine
can
replace
real
massage
but
have
to
say
was
pleasantly
surprised
when
tried
this
eye
massager
the
heat
was
really
nice
and
it
was
good
pressure
very
relaxing
for
sure
the
only
reason
gave
it
stars
is
because
the
buttons
to
turn
off
the
music
or
adjust
anything
are
confusing
and
slightly
frustrating,
which
took
away
from
the
relaxing
experience
my
husband
had
to
fuss
around
with
the
buttons
as
well,
it
wasn't
just
me
anyway,
it's
good
buy
would
totally
recommend
it
and
would
make
great
gift
it
works
fine
found
it
interesting
and
funi
like
the
heat
and
massagehowever
see
some
matters
in
the
item
that
hope
the
company
consider
them;0
the
elastic
is
not
working
for
the
people
who
have
big
heads
my
bf
couldn
wear
it
it
was
too
much
tight
for
him
*
in
back
of
head
the
elastic
hook
is
made
to
get
tighter
not
loose0
when
you
wear
the
massager
,
you
should
guess
the
correct
bottom
between
the
bottoms
it
confusing
to
touch
and
see
which
bottom
is
for
power
which
one
is
for
heat
and
etc,by
the
time
you
ll
get
use
to
it,
but
that
would
be
great
if
they
could
place
0bottoms
separately
in
better
waythanks

searching
for
something
that
would
take
the
edge
off
the
headaches
have
been
getting
regularly
its
amazing
it
feels
so
good
it
massages
all
the
right
spots
when
my
head
hurts
have
even
fallen
asleep
with
it
on
makes
it
much
easier
for
me
to
fall
asleep
as
feel
so
relaxedmy
son
suffers
from
chronic
sinus
infection
and
this
helps
with
that
as
well
the
whole
family
fights
to
use
it
it
easy
to
use,
compact
and
quite
sturdy
just
wish
it
had
repeat
button
or
timerit
great
little
machine
that
will
help
with
tired
eyes
the
bluetooth
and
heat
options
are
really
nice
too
so
glad
found
this
definitely
keeper

von

her
ganz
nett
nur
bekommt

die

nach
min
sagt
er

voll
und
leuchtet
grün,
aber
leider
ist
es
nicht
so
the
product
was
super
easy
to
use
enjoyed
the
heat
and
the
way
it
would
inflate,
and
the
music
was
nice
music
was
bit
too
soft
but
very
relaxing
would
not
recommend
any
makeup,
because
it
does
easily
come
off
with
the
heat
however
material
was
easy
to
wipe
offtried
different
placements,
however
when
placed
it
higher
it
still
felt
it
would
squeeze
my
nose
when
it
would
inflate
which
is
why
gave
it
0/0
for
comfortdefinitely
would
recommend
the
product
this
massager
is
unlike
anything
have
ever
used
when
first
used
this,
had
it
plugged
in
and
thought
it
wasn
working
then
realized
you
had
to
use
this
when
not
on
chargethis
is
must
have
if
you
work
night
shifts
and
stare
at
screens
all
night
the
heat
from
this
felt
so
good
on
my
eyes
the
pressure
felt
nice
too,
although
it
was
bit
much
on
my
temples
but
that
can
be
adjustedhonestly
if
it
were
bit
lighter
just
go
to
bed
with
it
on
as
the
heat
is
quite
soothing
was
in
trance
like
state
listening
to
rain
sounds
while
having
this
on
awoke
in
such
state
of
relaxation
that
didn
move
for
minutes
hahabottom
line,
everyone
should
try
this
out
at
least
once
it
quite
the
experience
my
job
requires
me
to
use
computer
almost
all
of
the
day,
which
cause
my
eyes
to
be
dry
and
sometimes
red
have
tried
many
solutions,
eye
drops
and
other
eye
cooler
this
one
is
so
far
the
most
easy
to
use
and
works
much
better
like
how
the
design
is
made,
seems
very
sturdy
and
hitech
the
robot
voices
give
you
feedback
on
mode
used
also
like
how
therres
different
modes;
massages,
pulses,
heat,
etc
one
thing
noticed
is
the
button
is
very
sesitive,
its
also
hard
to
know
if
its
pressed
or
not,
which
makes
it
harder
to
changes
modes
or
closing
iti
noticed
after
second
use
that
my
eyes
were
more
hydrated,
less
irrited
and
it
helped
even
with
headaches
like
how
its
so
easy
to
use
with
such
amazing
results

bought
this
as
gift
for
my
best
friend
so
that's
why
don't
have
picture
she
has
frequent
migraines
and
insomnia
due
to
bad
car
accident
really
wanted
to
help
her
sleep
and
relax
she
was
so
excited
to
try
it
had
showed
her
the
item
online
only
couple
of
days
earlier
and
when
saw
she
liked
it
and
would
be
open
to
trying
it,
bought
it
right
away
it
came
really
fast
like
in
days
since
i'm
prime
member
it
was
packaged
nicely
and
looked
exactly
as
advertised
my
friend
cried
she
was
so
surprised
that
bought
her
such
thoughtful
gift
she
tried
it
and
it
made
her
fall
asleep
the
the
voice
prompts
walk
the
user
through
what's
happening
now
my
friend
's
head
is
so
sensitive
that
she
can't
use
an
electric
toothbrush
so
she
didn't
know
what
to
expect
it
was
pleasant
and
relaxed
feeling
with
just
enough
pressure
around
her
eyes
which
was
complimented
with
the
heat
she
let
her
whole
family
try
it
and
they
all
loved
it
her
sister
said
ruined
christmas
because
now
no
gift
will
top
what
bought
her
its
good
eye
massager
the
temperature
increase
occurs
right
away
and
the
programmed
music
is
spaish
the
massage
itself
is
ok,
not
amazing
but
not
horrible
the
machine
sits
little
weird
on
my
nose
and
the
initial
and
closing
greetings
are
little
loaded
than
necessary
overall
good
product
and
recommend
it
for
its
price
wow
just
wowmy
old
eye
massager
stopped
working,
so
bought
this
one
seeing
the
price
was
reasonablethis
thing
is
amazing,
was
so
tired
this
morning
when
this
arrived,
tried
it
immediately
and
this
felt
like
live
person
massaging
your
eyes
and
it
has
heat
and
music
while
being
massagedafter
one
session
my
eyes
were
so
relaxedhighly
recommended
if
work
infront
of
computer
all
the
time
full
disclosure:
after
buying
another
renpho
product
that
really
liked,
they
emailed
me
inviting
me
to
test
this
new
product
after
several
days
of
frustration
with
my
emails
not
getting
through,
was
able
to
reach
them
on
fb
messenger
and
they
honoured
the
offernotwithstanding
these
challenges,
the
eye
massager
is
effective
have
dry
eyes
my
optometrist
prescribed
heat
and
other
microwavable
masks
lose
heat
quickly
this
powered
heat
is
very
helpful
the
massager
is
relaxing
if
the
machinery
bit
noisy
after
uses
it
still
works
well
for
the
right
price,
it
good
value
this
is
fantastic
for
me,

lot
and
my
eyes
are
very
fatigue
most
of
the
time
this
device
has
seriously
improved
my
everyday
initially
its
bit
awkward,
but
after
few
minutes,
once
you
warm
up
to
the
feel
of
it,
you
can
enjoy
the
massagingeasy
to
use,
user
friendly
the
design
itself
is
very
sleek,
futuristic
look
and
feel
to
it,
thought
it
might
be
too
big
for
me
but
i'm
pretty
confident
its
one
size
fits
alli
got
my
mom
to
try
it
out
as
well,
she
works
long
days
at
the
hospital
and
the
lights
tend
to
bother
her
now
shes
using
it
everyday
and
might
need
second
onethe
movement
of
the
inner
parts
of
the
device
is
quite
loud,
but
can
be
ignored
because
the
bluetooth
you
can
have
with
your
own
musicgreat
company,
own
few
other
products
from
renpho
responsive
if
any
problems,
and
great
products
bought
this
as
christmas
gift
for
my
girlfriend
who
is
studying
for
her
phd
in
economics
without
really
being
sure
what
to
expect
read
all
of
the
negative
reviews
do
that,
but
decided
that
it
was
well
worth
itfirstly,
there
is
quite
bit
of
noise
from
the
air
pump,
but
that
is
more
than
made
up
for
by
the
experience
of
having
your
temples
massaged
with
heat
and
comfortafter
christmas
bought
myself
one,
which
then
let
me
daughter
take
to
university
when
she
went
back
after
the
holidaysnow
am
on
my
third
one
use
it
twice
day
once
at
lunch
time
to
relax
and
recharge
and
once
before
bed
to
help
release
the
stress
of
the
dayhighly
recommend
it
produit
pas
mal

correct
dans
ensemble
je
suis
satisfaitje
ne
donne
pas
la
nôtre
maximale
car
on
peut
toujours
s'améliorer
mais
bravo
quand
même
think
this
is
great
product
and
priced
more
reasonable
than
other
units
my
comment
about
ease
of
use
is
two
fold
the
buttons
to
change
mods,
speed
etc
are
very
sensitive
don't
have
to
touch
them
but
just
bring
my
finger
close
to
it
so
that
is
good/bad
thing
it
changes
so
easily
that
it
often
changes
without
me
wanting
it
to
but
bet
once
get
use
to
it,
that
will
be
appreciated
love
the
pressure
and
the
mediation
sounds
but
do
with
the
heat
was
little
bit
warmer
and
covered
bigger
area
overall,
my
recommendation
is
yes
get
this
product
this
thing
makes
awful
sounds
which
makes
it
pretty
hard
to
relax
dont
know
why
it
needs
to
have
voice
talking
to
you
which
is
creepy
the
pad
is
basically
balloon
or
the
arm
pressure
things
you
see
at
drug
stores
and
you
would
play
with
as
kid
but
tracks
blood
pressure
this
is
an
illusion
of
actually
doing
something
but
it
just
heats
up
and
pushes
on
your
face
this
shouldnt
even
be
product
this
product
was
surprisingly
really
nice
bought
it
on
really
random
whim,
but
am
really
glad
that
didi
really
happy
with
how
the
massage
itself
feels,
ve
never
had
anything
else
like
it
really
don
think
that
you
could
replicate
it
with
any
tool
other
than
something
like
thispersonally
prefer
the
softer
pressure
mode,
as
have
larger
eyes,
the
harder
pressure
can
sometimes
be
too
hard
the
controls,
while
seeminglysimple
and
unobtrusive
on
the
headset
itself,
can
take
some
getting
used
to,
because
they
cycle,
so
if
you
pass
by
your
favourite
setting
you
ve
got
to
cycle
through
all
other
modes
until
you
get
back
to
where
you
wantoverall,
if
you
want
to
boost
your
athome
relaxation,
this
gadget
is
great
and
unique
way
to
do
so
treat
yourself
:p
also,
you
could
probably
convince
people
it
is
fancy,

:
me

siempre

mis

que
dieran
un
masaje

que
el

era
fortísimo,

bought
this
to
massage
around
my
eyes
to
help
with
migrainesi
do
like
how
sturdy
and
powerful
this
is,
but
there
is
very
little
room
for
adjustmenteven
if
you
tighten
the
back
strap,
it
presses
down
on
certain
parts
of
your
face
more
them
others
and
can't
get
the
proper
pressure
without
pain
on
other
parts
of
my
face
am
not
able
to
get
the
massage
where
need
it
or
get
even
pressure
around
my
eyes
love
this
eye
massager
would
hesitate
to
recommend
it
without
stating
how
loud
it
is
use
it
with
fan
in
the
room
so
it
drowns
out
some
of
the
noise
and
makes
it
tolerable
the
heat
and
massage
function
is
very
relaxing
do
not
use
vibrate
it
even
louder
than
the
massage
and
not
enjoyable
in
any
way
overall
it
nice
luxury
product
love
this
product,
and
would
really
recommend
it
to
anyone
it
helps
to
get
rid
of
any
eye
pressure
after
long
day
of
working
on
laptop,
or
even
after
lack
of
sleep,
to
refresh
your
eyes
only
within
minsas
an
addition
to
what
already
mentioned
about
this
product,
i'd
like
to
say
that
renpho

an
extremely
supportive

blocked
after
using
the
eye
massager
for
week
my
eyes
feel
better
than
they
have
in
ages
the
heat
and
gentle
pressure
have
helped
tremendouslythe
massage
is
relaxing
and
helps
me
fall
asleep
it
knocks
my
husband
out

already
bought

ok
truth
told
completely
blown
away
was
skeptical
at
first
but
for
migraine
sufferer
like
me
this
was
helpful
granted
it
only
been
few
days
can
say
so
far
so
good
money
well
spent
took
about
hours
for
full
charge
and
ve
used
it
times
without
the
need
to
recharge
like
how
one
can
adjust
the
pressure,
heat
on
or
off
and
turn
off
the
music
if
necessary
very
easy
to
use
but
do
read
the
enclosed
manual
for
tips
use
it
to
unwind
at
night
just
before
bed
and
it
greatly
helped
went
looking
for
an
eye
massager
primarily
because
of
how
tried
and
irritated
my
eyes
feel
after
spend
too
much
time
on
the
computer
at
work
and
this
thing
knocked
it
out
of
the
parkthis
massager
feels
sturdy
and
has
different
modes
depending
on
how
long
you
want
to
use
it
for
you
can
choose
or
combine
heat,
vibration
and
pressure
my
favorite
feature
is
just
how
hot
you
can
turn
it
up
to
it
really
reminds
me
of
having
hot
towel
on
your
face
at
the
barbershopthe
massage
itself
is
very
relaxing
and
the
calming
spa
music
is
nice
touch
it
helped
my
eyes
after
just
few
uses
so
won
be
stopping
anytime
soon
very
good
bang
for
your
buck

cet

la

la
pression
est
surprenante
la
première
fois
la
chaleur
est
très
agréable
the
air
cushion
massage
is
better
than
expected
to
be
honest,
the
pressure
on
the
temples
is
quite
strongthe
heat
function
is
great
too
and
actually
warms
up
super
fastyes
there
is
some
motor
noise,
the
air
has
to
be
pumped
in,
but
can't
see
any
way
to
reduce
thati
found
the
default
music/sounds
pleasant,
and
again,
better
than
expectedi
found
if
wore
noise
cancelling
headphones
at
the
same
time
no
music,
just
to
cancel
the
noise,
it
made
the
experience
even
betterso
far
i'm
not
fan
of
the
vibration
function
because
find
the
massage
and
heat
just
so
relaxingmy
only
slightly
negative
comment
is
the
buttons
are
very
very
touch
sensitive,
so
you
activate
them
sometimes
when
just
looking
for
them
while
wearing
the
unit
i'm
sure
it
will
be
better
when
i'm
more
used
to
the
placement
j'ai
acheté
le
produit
car
je
passe
énormément
de
temps
devant
l'écran
d'ordinateur,
pour
mon
travail
malheureusement
il
n'a
pas
répondu
à
mes
attentes
je
ne
l'ai
essayé
que
quelques
fois
peine
avant
de
le
renvoyer
donc
ne
pourrait
pas
juger
de
la
tenue
sur
sa
longueur
avant
de
l'acheter
sachez
que
:
le
produit
arrive
avec
une
forte
odeur
de
plastique
/
chimique
qui
posée
aussi
proche
du
nez
est
très
désagréable
voir
nauséeux
je
vous
conseil
de
le
laver
avant
utilisation
l'appareil
est
la
limite
du
bruyant,
mais
c'est
supportable
le
son
faisant
parti
des
arguments
de
vente
est
de
très
piètre
qualité,
vous
serez
bien
mieux
avec
des
écouteurs
dans
les
oreille
ou
votre
propre
installation
sonore
une
voix
en
anglais
indique
les
modes
que
vous
choisissez,
vous
souhaite
la
bienvenue
et
vous
remercie
d'avoir
utiliser
le
produit
elle
peut
être
ennuyeuse
selon
vos
sensibilités
pour
ma
part
cela
faisait
un
peu
trop
commercial
ce
défaut
mineur
ne
le
sera
bien
entendu
pas
pour
tout
le
monde
mais
ce
qui
m'a
décidée
renvoyée
le
produit
c'est
la
douleur
ressentie
l'utilisation
le
masque
compressé
les
yeux
mais
aussi
les
tempes
sur
les
tempes
la
compression
était
trop
forte
même
avec
le
masque
desserrée
au
maximum
je
suis
une
femme
avec
une
petite
tête
je
me
suis
demandée
si
l'erreur
venait
de
moi
et
que
je
n'utilisais
pas
le
produit
correctement,
mais
après
plusieurs
tests,
je
ressortait
de
chaque
séance
avec
l'envie
de
vomirle
produit
donne
ce
qu'il
promet
mais
il
n'est
pas
fait
pour
tout
le
monde
pour
ma
part
il
me
faisait
plus
de
mal
que
de
bien
my
eyesight
has
been
steadily
getting
worse
during
covid
especially
as
am
staring
at
my
laptop
all
day
for
entertainment
and
work
have
been
using
heated
wheat
bag
before
bed
every
night
as
also
have
extremely
dry
eyes
didn't
realise
how
much
needed
this
initially
just
bought
it
to
try
it
out
and
see
what
the
hype
was
about
till
got
this
in
the
mail
and
tried
it
out
today
it's
amazingfirst
off,
it
is
very
comfortable
to
wear
with
an
adjustable,
thick
band
that
goes
around
the
back
of
my
head
easy
to
use;
just
had
to
press
the
power
button
for
the
various
modes
and
to
turn
it
on
and
off
music
was
surprisingly
relaxing
and
didn't
mind
it
at
all
when
thought
would
reminiscent
of
the
calm
meditation
appthe
highlight
is
that
it
massages
your
temples
as
well
read
somewhere
that
pressing
on
your
temples
few
times
helps
relieve
pressure
behind
the
eyes
not
sure
if
this
is
true
but
have
been
doing
this
occasionally
now
the
mask
does
much
better
job
of
this
and
feels
like
proper
massage
is
happening
across
my
face
with
great
pressure
the
addition
of
the
heat
only
mode
is
also
wonderful
for
when
just
need
bit
of
relief
over
my
eyes
love
it
bought
for
heat
option
to
relieve
dry
eyes
don
buy
if
you
have
blepharitis
and
want
or
need
heat
warm
is
the
best
it
can
doappearance,
quality
of
material,
and
packaging
make
great
first
impression
but
that
is
all
that
renpho
delivers
with
this
productcompression
massage
is
the
only
thing
that
was
not
completely
disappointing
but
could
not
feel
any
difference
between
soft
and
strong
pressurevibration
doesn
add
anything
but
extra
noise
to
the
experience
could
hardly
feel
anything
through
the
mask
and
air
bagsspeakers
suck
max
volume
is
too
low
to
hear
anything
over
the
noise
from
the
air
pump
and
vibrations
that
makes
the
blue
tooth
and
built
in
music
features
useless
although
the
speakers
don
seem
to
have
problem
putting
out
loud
feedback
and
static
every
time
button
is
pushed
the
speakers
produce
about
the
same
quality
of
sound
you
find
in
those
singing
birthday
cards
from
the
dollar
storethe
buttons
are
not
real
buttons
they
are
finger
sensors
and
you
end
up
pushing
several
just
trying
to
find
them
you
are
after
all
operating
this
thing
blindfolded
the
instructions
say
to
never
operate
it
without
wearing
it
because
you
can
damage
the
air
bags
that
is
probably
the
reason
their
newer
model
comes
with
remote
with
real
buttons
on
iti
have
no
idea
how
this
product
got
so
many
and
such
good
reviews
it
almost
feels
like
an
infomercial
scam
reading
all
the
one
and
two
star
reviews
echo
my
experience
almost
exactly
feels
no
different
after
using
it,the
volume
is
too
low
can
hear
what
they
are
saying,also
the
design
is
terrible
you
have
to
try
so
hard
to
find
the
buttons
to
change
settings
blindfolded
and
button
does
so
many
things
that
makes
it
frustrating
to
you

headache
in
my
temples
tried
it
twice
and
it
doesn't
do
anything
much,
and
the
last
time
tried
it,
the
massage
mode
did
not
work
and
the
machine
just
kept
vibrating
and
could
not
be
turned
off
trying
to
turn
the
thing
on
is
pain
too
as
the
sensor
button
to
turn
it
on
is
not
very
sensitive
waste
of
money
and
time
ended
up
returning
it
constantly
have
eye
strain
due
to
long
hours
of
work
in
front
of
monitors
this
did
not
bug
me
that
much
until
recently
decided
to
buy
this
eye
massager
to
have
try
and
did
not
expect
it
to
be
such
good
surprisethe
movement
of
the
massager
or
motor,
don
know
how
to
call
it
in
the
air
pressure
mode
actually
massage
all
the
acupuncture
points
around
the
eyes
know
this
because
learned
set
of
eye
exercises
in
school
before
and
this
eye
massager
actually
mimics
the
movement
learned
in
those
eye
exercises
this
shows
that
the
design
of
this
product
has
actually
scientific
basis,
which
makes
me
pleasantly
surprisedthe
messager
has
five
different
operating
modes
and
personally
think
the
air
pressure
mode
is
the
most
useful
because
of
the
movement
of
the
motor,
it
has
some
minor
noise
so
the
air
pressure
always
comes
with
music
personally
prefer
that
could
have
the
option
to
turn
the
music
off
because
could
listen
to
my
own
music
or
podcast
myself
when
use
this
product
since
cannot
use
my
eyes
hopefully
the
next
generation
of
the
product
can
consider
this
optionoverall
it
is
nice
product
and
recommend
to
anyone
who
has
eye
strain
and
needs
to
take
good
care
of
their
eyes
als
ich
eines
tages
durch

eine
"augenmassagebrille"
vorgeschlagen
bekam,
habe
ich
mich
gleich
inteniver
damit
beschäftigt,
und
am
ende
wurde
es
diese
hier
prinzipiell
eine
tolle
sache,
nur
finde
ich
die
vorhandene
polsterung
etwas
zu
gering
bei
meiner

finde
ich
den

anfangs
sogar
ein

schmerzhaft,

anfangs
konnte
ich
mir
ehrlich
gesagt
nur
wenig
unter
einem
augenmassagegerät
vorstellennach
dem
ersten
test
konnte
es
jedoch
voll
überzeugen
wobei
es
eher
die
schläfen
als
die
augen
selbst
massiert
danach
ist
man
merklich
entspannter
als
vorhersehr
gut
ist
außerdem,
dass
man
sowohl

als
auch
die
druckstärke
in

anpassen
kann
it
loud
and
heavy
machine
that
is
not
suitable
to
be
used
before
bed
,touch
buttons
are
way
too
sensitive
and
turn
on/off
on
their
own
,would
not
stay
on
one
setting
,i
don
know
why
it
priced
so
high
for
such
useless
product
have
been
using
this
for
week
to
treat
mgd
blepharitis
find
it
has
been
helping,
maybe
could
get
little
bit
hotter
my
biggest
complaint
is
how
rigid
the
area
around
the
nose
bridge
is,
and
it
gets
uncomfortable
fairly
quickly
when
wearing
because
the
mask
is
moving
to
perform
the
eye
massage
you
can't
really
adjust
it
because
it
just
moves
itself
back
to
where
it
hits
the
nose
and
rubs
would
add
some
more
padding/cushioning
in
that
area
for
comfort
am
very
disappointed
in
this
eye
massager
for
my
condition
have
mgd,
disease
of
the
oil
glands
along
my
eyelashes
that
causes
blocked
glands
this
mask
does
not
get
close
to
my
eyelids
and
it
does
not
have
sufficient
heat
to
melt
the
oils
in
the
blocked
glands
think
this
might
be
my
first
amazon
review
but
just
had
to
got
this
few
days
ago
on
whim
and
it
amazing
use
the
sleep
mode
just
before
bed,
and
the
vitality
mode
in
the
morning
to
wake
me
up
and
get
the
grogginess
out
of
my
eyes
have
also
used
the
clear
and
automatic
modes
throughout
the
day
so
far
haven
even
had
to
charge
it,
not
even
out
of
the
box
for
some
reason
didn
even
realize
there
would
be
heat,
but
it
was
nice
surprise
not
my
first
renpho
product
and
won

amazing

it
makes

easy

not

but
it
is
easy
to
turn

the
heat
feels
really
nice
on
my
eyes,
and
the
mask
also
massages
your
temples
which
feels
great
if
you
have

the

in
general,
the
product
is
well
built
super
easy
and
straightforward
to
use
good
value/quality
it
does
what
is
supposed
to
found
it
more
comfortable
while
lying
in
bed
because
it
adds
less
pressure
to
the
nose
at
first
you
ll
have
to
find
the
right
position
once
you
get
that
the
massage
works
well
like
the
best
the
lower
pressure
option
because
it
more
gentle
but
you
can
also
use
harder
option,
which
someone
might
like
too
guess
the
music
plays
nicely
while
massaging,
and
it
kinda
of
move
around
your
head
nice
detail
this
thing
is
soooo
relaxing
suffer
from
sensory
processing
disorder
and
anxiety
and
this
eye
massager,
unintentionally,
has
been
life
savermy
therapist
told
me
to
try
to
close
my
eyes
when
get
over
stimulated,
problem
with
that
is
all
my
other
senses
get
heightened
and
doesn't
really
help
much
however,
with
this
device,
am
able
to
tune
everything
else
out
more
easily
so
now
when
get
overstimulated,
just
put
this
massager
on,
put
it
on
sleep
mode
and
decompress
for
little
bit
it
has
really
helped
me
with
my
anxiety
and
sensory
processing
disorder
so
there
you
go,
renfro,
new
market
to
tap
into
lolthis
massager
is
great
but
not
perfect
to
make
it
perfect
would;
have
raised
buttons
on
the
front
it's
kind
of
annoying
to
have
to
feel
around
to
adjust
the
device
while
you're
wearing
it
have
more
than
just
one
song
its
repetitive
and
pretty
much
useless
even
if
you
have
or
so
songs
that
gets
cycled
would
be
lot
better
and
finally
include
just
simple
reusable
bag
to
store
it
in
because
while
its
really
portable,
it's
hard
to
find
bag
to
bring
it
around
in
because
it's
an
odd
shape
would
love
to
take
this
on
vacation
with
meimo
the
positives
totally
outweigh
the
negatives
and
is
actually
an
excellent
tool
for
my
mental
health

puedo
decir
que
son
la

un

lo
negativo
es
que
el

es
un

molesto
he

con

this
product
would
rate
0/0
stars
if
it
didn't
make
so
much
noise
the
massage
options
are
great
and
it
feels
amazing
but,
you
do
have
to
hear
the
motors
going
on
your
forehead
all
the
time
well,
except
when
you
are
in
warm
mode
onlyif
there
was
way
to
quite
the
motorsit
would
be
wow:}
love
it
but
didn
get
the
remote
control
that
goes
with
it
so
can
only
use
the
default
modes
believe
that
with
the
remote
control
could
decide
to
have
the
air
pressure
and
the
heat
without
the
music
which
would
really
appreciate
would
have
given
stars
if
it
wasn
from
that
it
very
relaxing
like
the
different
modes
and
the
music
is
calming
the
default
timer
is
set
to
minutes
just
enough
to
relax
and
have
little
me
time
also
super
nice
to
use
just
before
going
to
bed
to
help
relax

there's

con
ese
ruido,
lo
de
la

enfin
queda
un
poco
fuera
de
lugar
in
the
product
description,
it
says,
"effectively
relieve
eye
pain,
improve
blood
flow,
improve
sleep
quality,
reduce
headaches,
and
alleviating
chronic
eye
soreness"
well,
that's
all
great
and
maybe
it
does
do
all
those
things,
but
the
only
thing
care
about
with
this
product
so
far
is
that
it
feels
amazingi
actually
let
it
sit
on
my
floor
for
weeks
before
trying
it
because
i've
used
lot
of
these
massaging
products
before
and
hadn't
really
been
impressed
when
finally
put
it
on
my
head,
though,
thought
it
was
amazing
and
so
relaxing
you
will
likely
have
to
adjust
the
strap
to
give
you
the
right
kind
of
tightness
for
your
head,
and
it
will
definitely
take
you
while
to
get
used
to
using
the
control
buttons
on
the
side
you
have
to
do
it
without
the
use
of
your
eyes
and
by
listening
to
what
the
voice
is
saying,
but
don't
think
too
many
people
will
be
disappointed
in
the
nice
pressure
and
vibration
you'll
be
feeling
all
around
your
eyes

great
product,
we
have
other
renpho
products,
so
very
happy
with
their
quality
this
feels
very
weird
at
first
as
it
inflates
sounds
like
an
auto
blood
pressure
machine
and
farts
the
air
out
haha
the
warmth
is
nice
and
it
does
feel
like
it
benefits
ve
used
it
about
times
now
purchased
to
see
if
it
will
help
with
dry
eye
time
will
tell
the
music
is
ok
overall
very
happy
with
this
easy
to
charge
with
supplied
usb
cable
have
been
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
eye
massager
the
pros:the
nice,
relaxing
music
gets
me
into
meditative
trance
that
allows
me
to
wind
downthe
different
settings
provide
some
targeted
massages
my
favourite
is
the
automatic
and
vitality
mode
with
low
music,
mid
temperature
and
strong
pressureit's
easy
to
put
on
though
it
can
move
throughout
the
massage
as
it
applies
and
loses
pressure,
so
have
to
adjust
it
at
times
to
make
sure
it
doesn't
put
pressure
on
my
noseyou
can
easily
clean
the
surface
and
it
has
sleek
designcons:the
massages
are
short
and
it
can
be
nuisance
to
turn
it
on
again
to
find
the
perfect
pressure,
volume,
and
temperature
mode
you
had
when
it
shut
offdon't
wear
it
with
makeup
on
it
leaves
you
with
smudges
and
some
lost
eyelashes
if
you're
wearing
mascara
so
midday
use
might
not
be
ideal
if
you're
supposed
to
be
presentable
somewhereonce
the
device
is
on,
you
have
to
be
careful
pressing
the
buttons
to
adjust
modes
the
buttons
are
really
sensitive
and
fumbling
around
to
find
the
right
button
for
what
you
want
to
do
and
adjusting
the
modes,
can
take
away
from
your
relaxing
experience
suggest
memorizing
which
button
does
what
and
being
patient
until
you
get
hang
of
how
to
find
the
buttons
and
how
much
pressure
to
apply
right
off
the
bat
on
each
oneoverall,
great
product
didn't
think
i'd
enjoy
it
but
i'm
glad
have
it
around
it
will
be
perfect
to
help
with
pressure

like
the

of

have
only
one
issue:
the

not

about
how
to
use

button
it
is
not
by
hard
pressing
the
button,
but
rather
by
placing
finger
on
the
button
for
second
it
took
me
while
to

thought
the

was
defected

almost
returned

ich
habe
die
augenmassagebrille
gekauft,
um
mir
nach
einem
anstrengenden

eine

found
this
while
looking
for
an
eye
massager
with
the
global
pandemic
i've
found
myself
using
screens
more
and
more,
and
with
that
i've
found
that
my
eyes
are
more
strained
and
more
dry
than
usual
this
massager
had
some
good
reviews
so
bought
oneas
per
the
attached
photos,
in
addition
to
the
massager,
the
box
comes
with
usb
charging
cable
and
user
manual
the
unit
itself
felt
solid
and
wore
it
comfortably
first
ran
it
through
its
default
settings
and
found
what
some
other
reviewers
did
with
the
pressure
on
the
temples
being
pretty
strong
both
the
strong
pressure
and
the
air
pump
noises
were
little
unexpected
at
first,
as
i've
never
before
used
an
eye
massager,
but
got
used
to
them
pretty
quickly
also
feel
like
the
strong
pressure
was
helpful
in
creating
relief
during
the
massage
i've
used
it
handful
of
times
now
and
enjoy
using
itsome
tips
that
might
help:0
the
box
doesn't
come
with
charger,
just
the
cable
it
needs
at
least
0a
to
charge
which
isn't
too
much
used
an
old
iphone
wall
plug
and
it
worked
great0
make
sure
you
tighten
the
headband
the
first
time
used
it
didn't
tighten
it
all
the
way
and
it
moved
around
my
face
little
bit
while
massaging0
the
heat
is
enough
for
me
to
sweat
little
alcohol
wipes
worked
well
to
clean
the
eye
pads0
because
it
goes
over
your
eyes,
you
can't
use
your
eyes
to
look
at
the
controls
memorized
where
the
buttons
were
and
what
they
did
beforehand,
though
if
you
want
to
do
things
like
sync
your
bluetooth
to
your
phone,
it
might
be
helpful
to
have
someone
else
around
for
the
first
time
you
use
the
device0
the
air
pressure
and
music
volume
can
both
be
changed
using
buttons
on
the
device
if
need
beoverall
i'm
happy
with
the
purchase
and
looking
forward
to
using
it
more
in
the
times
to
come
meh
the
pressure
isn't
that
strong
even
at
the
hardest
mode,
the
vibration
is
kind
of
weird,
and
the
heat
well
just
makes
my
eyes
feel
weirdif
the
pressure
was
stronger
it
would
make
this
product
better
you
cant
really
use
it
to
relax
because
its
quite
loudi
have
renpho
massage
gun
which
was
quite
good
but
this
was
little
disappointing
it's
fineappears
well
madei
like
heat,
but
found
it
little
too
hot,
at
least
the
first
time
got
used
to
it
it
can
be
run
without
heat
thoughhave
to
adjust
position
on
my
face
to
hit
the
right
areas
right
on,
and
still
feel
like
it's
not
quite
hitting
all
the
points,
only
some
so
fit
seems
to
be
an
issueunlike
some
of
the
other
reviews,
wish
the
pressure
was
more
and/or,
with
reference
to
the
last
point,
maybe
it's
just
not
hitting
the
points
correctly
so,
again,
fit
may
be
the
issueit
was
relaxing>
don't
know
if,
for
the
price,
can
really
recommend
strongly
best
can
say
is
i'm
probably
not
going
to
return
it
bought
it
in
july
and
it
worked
fine
for
month
and
started
to
notice
the
pressure
kept
getting
weaker
and
weaker
had
to
set
the
pressure
level
"soft"
because
the
normal
pressure
was
already
strong
for
me,
but
now
even
the
strong
pressure
is
softer
than
the
prevoise
soft
level
and
now
have
battery
problem
used
the
massager
just
one
time
after
full
charge
and
it
needs
anotehr
full
charge
to
use
at
least
used
more
than
couple
times
without
charging
again
in
july
and
agust
never
dropped
the
massager
and
made
contact
with
water
dont
know
why
it
doesnt
work
as
proper
as
it
was
in
the
beginning
after
using
it
for
months
dont
recommend
this
product
family
friend
had
similar
device
that
they
let
me
try,
but
was
in
the
$0
range
which
was
out
of
my
budget,
but
was
pretty
enamoured
by
the
idea
of
such
device
so
decided
to
shop
around
to
find
something
that
was
in
my
budgeti
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
device
it
feels
very
solid,
and
the
locations
and
patterns
that
it
has
for
applying
pressure
and
heat
are
very
well
tuned
this
did
the
trick
for
me
just
as
well
as
the
more
expensive
optionsthe
one
design
complaint
have
is
that
the
buttons
on
the
side
are
capacitive
touch,
so
just
running
your
finger
over
the
triggers
them
which
isn't
terrible
thing
in
and
of
itself,
but
it
makes
finding
the
buttons
without
accidentally
touching
the
other
ones
while
you're
wearing
it
difficult
every
time
want
to
switch
the
pressure
or
turn
off
the
heat
or
turn
on
the
buzzing,
end
up
pressing
the
wrong
buttons
billion
times
and
have
to
cycle
through
most
of
the
settings
again
to
get
it
where
want
itthat
being
said,
that
is
vveerryy
small
price
to
pay
for
how
well
this
works
absolutely
would
buy
again
and
am
thinking
about
maybe
snagging
another
one
for
christmas
gift
very
uncomfortable,
this
is
not
what
expected
read
all
reviews
and
thought
this
will
be
something
useful
save
your
money

with

the

if
you
are

this
is
something

this

is
not

purely

the

be
'tapped',
meaning
very
slight
contact
with

or
even
the
edge
of
the

will
trigger
the

and
of

since
it
is
'tapped',

not

are

however,
there
will
be

much
worth
the
money
buti
feel
like
slapping
hot
towel
on
your
eyes
and
simply
let
it
sit
there
provides
more
'comfortable'
and
relaxing
experience
than
this
product
did
for
me
personally
now,
once
again,
the
heating
on
this
massager
is
fine,
but
think
it
is
just
the
heat
+
moisture
of
the
towel
provides
more
'fuller'
heating
experience
for
myself
i've
used
the
eye
massager
the
past
few
days
on
all
its
modes
and
plan
to
continue
using
it
before
this,
i've
never
gotten
face
massage
or
eye
massage
so
wasn't
quite
sure
what
to
expect
overall,
was
good
experience
and
would
buy
it
againthe
good:it
does
exactly
what
it
says
it
does
it
fits
comfortably
on
my
head
and
has
an
adjustable
band
so
it
doesn't
squeeze
anything
too
hardthe
materials
in
contact
with
my
face
are
soft,
durable,
and
good
quality
the
massage
itself
is
strong
but
comfortablemy
favorite
feature
was
the
heat
compression;
definitely
the
most
relaxing
part
of
the
massagethe
speakers
were
the
equivalent
of
good
laptop
speakers
not
amazing,
but
better
than
what
expected
for
music
coming
out
of
an
eye
massageri
like
that
it
folds
up
haven't
traveled
with
it
yet,
but
folded
up,
it
won't
take
too
much
space
in
my
small
backpackthe
not
as
good:i
wasn't
big
fan
of
the
music
that
comes
with
it
liked
that
you
can
bluetooth
your
own
music
or
turn
the
volume
down
and
listen
to
music
on
different
speakersif
you're
trying
to
adjust
the
volume
while
wearing
it,
it's
very
easy
to
accidentally
touch
the
power
button
and
change
modes
would
have
liked
to
see
the
volume
on
the
opposite
side
if
you're
using
bluetooth,
you
can
easily
adjust
the
volume
from
your
phone
instead
overall,
after
spending
the
day
staring
at
computer
screen,
i've
found
this
an
excellent
way
to
transition
into
my
endofday
routine
definitely
recommend
for
anyone
who
does
lot
of
computer
work
neat
product
honestly
found
it
quite
relaxing
with
the
massage
feature
it
does
quite
good
job
at
hitting
the
pressure
points,
and
somehow
manages
to
provide
enough
pressure
to
help
alleviate
headache
/
sorenessadditionally,
liked
how
it
has
heating
feature
probably
something
use
bit
less
often,
but
definitely
feels
nice
to
the
touch
and
not
too
hotoverall,
good
buy
for
people
that
enjoy
face
massage
and
don
want
to
splurge
on
the
spa
don
normally
feel
compelled
to
write
reviews
but
this
product
deserves
one
when
ordered
it,
was
pretty
prepared
to
be
disappointed
as
long
time
chronic
pain
sufferer,
have
tried
so
many
things
seeking
any
type
of
relief,
usually
to
be
let
down
well,
this
product
surprised
me
it
truly
awesome
it
follows
through
on
everything
it
says
it
will
the
one
and
only
issue
have
found
is
that
the
touch
buttons
are
very
sensitive
but
that
is
very
minor
detail
it
doesn
cure
my
headaches
but
it
gives
an
incredible
and
relaxing
eye
and
temple
massage
my
eyes
feel
much
much
better
after
using
it
the
heat
and
pressure
are
so
good
and
it
holds
charge
for
good
amount
of
time
am
truly
glad
took
chance
and
bought
this
usually
spend
around
0+
hours
in
front
of
computer
with
multiple
screens
daily
recent
remote
work
made
my
eyes
getting
more
and
more
fatigue,
as
the
lightening
that
have
is
not
perfect
already
had
scale
from
renpho
which
helped
me
so
much,
so
consider
it
as
very
trustworthy
brand
seeing
eye
massager
didn't
need
much
time
to
order
itthe
product
is
very
convenient
on
eye
however,
some
adjustments
on
the
band
might
be
required,
depending
on
the
head
my
eyes
truly
feels
more
relaxed
after
using
initially
thought
0mins
for
sleep
mode
is
too
long
and
would
get
bored,
but
comparing
going
to
sleep
with
and
without
the
routine
made
me
realize
that
those
extra
0mins
before
sleep
are
worth
itonly
con
would
see
is
battery
life,
allows
basically
for
around
mins
of
the
device
being
used
not
as
perfect
comparing
to
couple
hours
of
charging,
however
understanding
how
the
technology
works
can
understand
the
reasons
behind
it
and
it
still
doesn't
really
require
me
to
re
charge
it
on
daily
basis,
which
is
gooddefinitely
can
recommend
during
the
past
months
because
have
been
working
from
home
more
due
to
the
quarantine,
ve
been
on
my
computer
or
mobile
phone
all
the
time
and
started
to
get
headaches
and
sore
eyes
was
told
by
friend
it
may
worki
ve
had
it
for
days
now
and
ve
already
used
it
around
times
first
was
not
sure
if
it
will
fit
because
have
rather
small
head
but
adjusted
the
hinge
and
the
band
to
fit
my
headthe
heat
and
the
pressure
of
the
massager
are
right
on
around
my
eyes
and
the
whole
eye
area
and
bit
towards
the
temples
it
used
to
take
one
advil
at
some
nights
because
of
pain
in
the
last
two
nights
the
massager
helped
and
didn
take
the
advil
last
night
think
it
could
be
from
the
massager
anyhow,
ve
found
it
relaxing
and
helpful
in
terms
of
my
sore
eyesi
haven
used
it
with
my
mobile
phone
to
listen
to
music
so
no
comments
on
that
but
the
quality
of
the
music
played
on
the
device
isn
that
high
but
anyway
turn
it
off
as
bought
it
only
for
the
massage
not
the
music
this
massager
is
definitely
fine
and
great
value
for
the
money,
however,
was
not
able
to
use
it
fully
as
there
are
to
many
useless
functions
for
me
the
most
important
was
the
heating,
and
was
heating
pretty
good
one
minus
was
that
was
not
able
to
deactivate
sound
finally,
was
connecting
with
my
bluetooth
to
isolate
the
sounds
of
the
nature

0mins,
it
can

my

pain
and
make
it
relaxi
truly
recommend
this
product
for
office
people
who
use
computer
dailythe
only
con
of
the
product
is
the
operation
noise,
the
noise
of
applying
and
relaxing
pressure
was
too
loud
for
me
the
noise
is
okay
to
the
user,
however,
it
is
little
bit
annoying
to
the
person
sleep
next
to
youso
do
not
recommend
using
it
while
your
sleep
but
do
recommend
using
it
in
your
resting
timeit
also
has
bluetooth
function
on
your
phonei
will
rate
out
of
to
this
product
am
very
happy
with
this
product
the
motor/air
pump
makes
bit
of
noise
while
inflating
and
deflating,
but
don't
consider
that
problem
at
all
i've
just
used
few
times
on
the
sleep
mode
did
feel
weird
at
first,
but
great
relaxation
once
finished
had
to
find
good
position
with
the
mask
during
certain
patterns
it
would
plug
my
nose/airways
bit
at
the
bridge
of
my
nose
positioning
the
unit
higher
made
difference
my
only
complaint
is
that
the
longest
setting
is
min
can
always
rerun
the
cycle
though
ich
muss
echt
gestehen,
ich
war
sehr
skeptisch
ich
hatte
im
vorfeld
noch
nie
von
diesem
produkt
gehört
und
bin
eher
durch
zufall
darauf
gestoßen
was
soll
ich
sagenfür
mich
die
entdeckung
schlechthin
super
zu
bedienen
obwohl
die
gebrauchsanweisung
nicht
super
ist
aber
das
ergebnis
zählt
sehr
sehr
entspannend
und
hilft
schmerzen
zu
lindern
la
prima
volta
che
l'ho
provato
non
mi
è
piaciuto
pensavo
di
fare
il
reso
ho
capito
che
le
mie
aspettative
erano
troppo
alte
mi
aspettavo
un
massaggio
ancora
più
vario,
ma
dopo
averlo
provato
per
due
settimane
me
ne
sono
innamorata
la
metto
in
modalità
sleep
mi
aiuta
ad
addormentarmi
è
davvero
rilassante,
il
calore
è
molto
piacevole
addirittura
mi
fa
passare
il
mal
di
testa
la
possibilità
di
poter
ascoltare
la
musica
che
si
desidera,
mentre
si
fa
il
massaggio,
è
inestimabile

di
qualità
la

ne
vale
davvero
la
pena
got
this
product
week
ago
and
it
was
delivered
really
fast
for
the
past
few
days,
ve
used
it
about
times
each
day
as
someone
who
works
in
front
of
screens
lot,
this
thing
works
like
magic
the
heating
and
massage
feature
not
only
relaxes
the
eye,
but
also
the
temple
which
have
relieved
most
of
my
headaches
these
past
few
days
it
super
easy
to
use,
really
comfortable
to
have
on
while
sitting
up
or
lying
down,
and
the
strap
is
adjustable
to
fit
your
head
as
you
like
it
even
has
its
own
music
and
bluetooth
option
for
your
own
tunes
would
definitely
give
this
product
as
gift
to
friends
and
family
nice
packaging,
battery
last
for
about
0mins
use
default
massage
with
heat
but
can
add
vibration,
or
choose
heat
only
or
vibrate
only
good
quality
build
and
comfortablei
did
read
review
about
this
helping
with
sinus
but
it
did
nothing
for
me
it
is
still
good
massager
to
have
got
it
on
discount
at
$0,
and
used
this
almost
daily
must
say
the
heating
option
is
very
nicemusic
can
be
turned
off
but
it
involves
quite
few
press
to
select
the
charging
port
is
at
angle
and
little
difficult
to
connect
well
sometimes
with
charging
cable
my
constant
headaches
that
had
almost
everyday
disappeared
after
using
this
product
for
daysexcellent
productthe
design
of
this
product
looks
luxury
the
fabric
used
for
the
inner
part
the
one
that
touches
eyes
is
really
soft
and
nice
to
touchmy
wife
and
use
this
product,
we
have
different
head
size,
hence
we
need
to
adjust
the
elastic
band,
surprisingly
it
is
very
easy
to
adjust
it
it
is
firm
and
made
of
good
quality
of
elastic
bandit
is
very
simple
to
use
this
product
put
it
one,
press
the
power
button
lighlty
for
few
seconds,
welcome
female
voice
is
heard
to
welcome
us,
and
it
will
start
the
massaging
you
can
use
few
different
modes
from
to
minutes
durationa
highly
recommended
product
to
those
that
normally
have
tired
eyes
and
headaches
from
the
tiredness
fell
asleep
with
this
machine
out
of
times
for
single
person
with
problem
falling
asleep,
it
is
great
product
however
the
sound
it
makes
is
so
loud
that
my
husband
cant
sleep
while
i'm
using
it
also
wish
it
had
the
option
to
not
turn
on
the
voice/music
at
all
the
renpho
eye
massager
is
game
changer
for
me
my
job
mostly
consists
of
working
on
computer
and
frequently
suffer
from
eye
strain
and
headaches
bought
the
renpho
massager
with
the
hope
that
it
can
relieve
some
of
the
tension,
and
am
honestly
blown
away
with
how
effective
this
little
piece
of
tech
is
use
it
every
day
for
0min
before
sleep
not
only
is
it
very
relaxing
and
makes
falling
asleep
much
easier,
but
also
in
the
morning
wake
up
without
headaches
and
blurry
vision
also
feel
like
it
reduces
the
dark
circles
and
small
wrinkles
around
the
eyes
also,
the
customer
service
is
great
when
the
heating
function
in
my
eye
massager
stopped
working,
contacted
rehpho
and
they
immediately
sent
me
new
one
also
own
held
massager
from
renpho
and
both
devices
are
really
wellmade
and
high
quality
am
very
happy
with
the
company
and
the
massager
and
honestly
recommend
it
if
you
suffer
from
eye
strain
bought
it
for
about
weeks
and
loving
it
the
massager
is
very
easy
to
use
just
putting
it
on
like
wearing
pair
of
large
vr
glasses
and
only
three
buttons
are
involved
to
bring
the
stress
relief
experience
the
eyes
will
be
completely
covered
and
the
massage
together
with
the
heat
and
the
music
provides
soothing
environment
similar
to
meditation
the
heat
addresses
the
tiredness
of
eyes
after
long
day
of
work
and/or
looking
at
the
computer
screen
my
personal
favorite
model
is
massage+heat+music
switching
modes
is
also
very
easy
by
pressing
one
button
only
would
strongly
recommend
if
you
are
working
from
home
and/or
spent
quite
amount
of
time
in
front
of
computers
or
other
screens
originally
got
one
for
my
dad
after
his
cataract
operation
to
ease
the
strain
of
one
eye
working
for
two
and
he
said
it
really
helped
you
can
adjust
the
pressure
of
the
massagers,
which
is
great
since
we
were
able
to
set
it
to
no
pressure
just
to
be
safe
tried
it
on
and
within
minutes
was
feeling
relaxed
it
feels
like
someone
is
rubbing
your
temples
and
through
warm
compress
got
one
for
myself
run
it
for
minutes
at
bed
time
find
it
helps
to
clear
the
sinuses
too
and
you
can
pair
it
to
your
phone
and
listen
to
an
audiobook
while
resting
everyone
should
have
this
overall,
this
is
fairly
good
eye
massager
liked
the
multiple
heat
and
strength
options
as
could
customize
it
to
my
liking
did
find
it
little
bit
heavy
to
wear
if
don't
have
anything
to
rest
my
head
on
while
using
it
the
build
quality
seems
very
good
no
issues
with
stitching
and
the
item
feels
solid
work
all
day
&
night
on
computers
and
am
looking
at
screens
0/0
so
what
wanted
was
something
to
help
relax
me
after
looking
at
screen
for
hours
but
feel
like
this
just
isn't
as
good
as
one
jad
experienced
while
was
out
shopping
however
my
girlfriend
on
the
other
hand
absoloutely
loves
it
so
in
that
aspect
it
was
worthwhile
purchase
as
she
wears
glasses
and
this
helps
with
her
eyes

friend
recommended
it
the
reviews
were
good
great
relaxation
with
built
in
sounds,
several
mode
charge
with
usb
used
it
three
time
and
did
not
show
sign
of
being
drained
great
way
to
relax
before
sleep
of
during
the
day
good
value
for
the
money
imho
saw
it
on
amazon
and
thought
of
giving
it
try
the
shipping
was
fast
product
comes
with
simple
brochure
there
are
five
modes
ranging
from
min
to
min
all,
heat,
vibration
and
massaging
components
work
as
intended
the
headband
is
of
good
quality
chagrining
is
needed
roughly
after
min
session
uses
chagrining
cable
is
included
without
an
adapter
but
these
days
almost
everyone
has
mobile
charger
which
can
be
used
typically
use
it
before
going
to
sleep
and
it
just
certainly
helps
es
fantástico
la
verdad
es
que
relaja
mucho
lo
recomiendo
por
poner
un
pero,
me
hubiese
gustado
que
quedará
en
memoria
la
configuración
deseada
de
calor,
presión
música
al
iniciar
siempre
empieza
con
el
programa
inicial
pero
luego
es
muy
sencillo
modificarlo
así
que
le
pongo
cinco
estrellas
was
honestly
not
sure
about
this
product
but
saw
reviews
and
was
getting
desperate,
thought
it
worth
try
work
very
long
hours
typing
and
can
wear
my
glasses
with
my
face
mask
so
ve
been
having
really
bad
tension
headaches
after
work
from
eye
strain
used
this
massager
then
gave
myself
0/0
minute
head
neck
massage
and
my
headache
was
gone
good
to
help
you
unwind
and
relax
heat
feature
is
fantastic
not
fan
of
the
vibration
setting
but
seriously,
this
massager
feels
fantastic
not
sure
on
it
own
it
would
have
taken
away
my
headache
completely
but
with
little
extra
work,
finally
got
some
relief
bought
this
for
the
sole
purpose
of
making
kids
get
off
the
devices
and
relax
their
eyes,
and
this
little
thing
is
way
better
than
bargained
for
if
you
are
like
me
sitting
in
front
of
computer
all
day
with
eye
strain
at
the
end
of
the
day,
you
should
try
this
not
only
it
helps
relax
the
eyes,
but
it
also
provides
pleasant
relaxing
experience
with
the
heating,
and
calm
music
feature
you
could
practice
meditation
while
you
relax
your
eyes,
one
stone
two
birds
overall
like
this
product
and
hope
this
review
is
helpful
to
you
ve
been
looking
for
eye
massager
for
long
time,
this
one
is
by
far
the
best
one
have
tried
the
heat
is
well
heated
and
the
temple
massage
gets
ride
of
my
headachesthe
build
of
the
eye
massager
is
high
quality,
definitely
recommend
giving
it
try
if
you
re
in
the
market
you
won
be
disappointedrenpho
products
are
reliable
and
customer
service
is
greataddison
after
being
person
who
has
migraines
and
eye
akes
find
after
use
this
device
it
has
eased
up
my
pains
and
allow
me
to
have
much
easer
day
this
device
is
great
use
it
every
day
mostly
at
night
just
before
go
to
sleep
ll
recommend
this
device
for
anyone
most
of
all
those
who
has
tension
and
pain
about
or
above
there
eyes
it
great
item
un
po'
scettica
all'inizio
ma
per
rilassare
gli
occhi
dopo
una
giornata
al
computer
alleviare
la
sensazione
di
stanchezza
funziona
l'unica
nota
non
proprio
positiva
è
il
rumore,
piuttosto
fastidioso
considerato
che
dovrebbe
aiutare
rilassarsi
the
renpho
eye
massager
massages
around
the
eye
and
temporal
lobes
everything
works
pretty
well
and
quite
easy
to
get
started
there
is
regular
machine
sound
when
the
massager
parts
move
around,
but
don't
find
it
annoying
or
too
loud
overall
satisfied
it
cool
idea
it
doesn
go
as
hard
as
would
like
on
the
temples,
and
it
took
while
for
the
wife
to
figure
out
how
to
use
it
otherwise
it
great
would
recommend
having
nonstretchy
head
band
to
replace
the
current
one
i've
suffered
from
headaches
for
long
time
and
haven't
been
able
to
find
anything
that
really
helped
take
them
away
the
renpho
eye
massager
has
helped
relieve
tension
in
my
head
during
headache
and
even
prevented
few
from
turning
into
full
blow
headaches
and
migraines
even
just
using
the
massager
as
heat
mask
was
great
as
well
and
very
calming
the
only
thing
is
the
motors
are
touch
loud
and
if
there
was
way
they
could
be
bit
quieter
this
would
be
perfect,
aside
from
that
this
has
been
an
amazing
purchase
bellissimo
articolo,
inizialmente
ero
molto
dubbiosa
invece
mi
sono
completamente
ricreduta
io
soffro
molto
di
dolori
da
sinusite
quando
metto
questo
apparecchio
sulla
faccia
provo
un
enorme
sollievo
alla
fine
di
ogni
trattamento
persino
miei
figli
me
lo
rubano
per

sehr
gutes
massagegerät
absolut
solide
verarbeitet
besonders
durchdacht
ist
der
maskeninnenteil
welcher
sehr
gut
zu
reinigen
bzw
desinfizieren
ist
honestly
bought
this
out
of
curiosity
and
im
very
glad
did
use
computer
all
day
and
my
eyes
are
exhausted
at
the
end
of
the
dayi
lie
down
for
bit
with
the
eye
massager
when
get
home
and
my
eyes
feel
refreshed
very
happy
like
that
the
strap
around
the
head
is
adjustable,
can
fit
most
people
sometimes
it
can
be
confusing
to
use
because
you
can't
see
what
you
are
doing
when
changing
the
settings
unless
you
take
it
off
wish
there
were
more
options
without
the
heat
setting
or
that
you
could
make
your
own
combinations
of
settings
other
than
that,
love
the
pressure
feature
and
the
fact
that
it
hits
around
the
temples,
it
helps
with
my
migraines
would
definitely
recommend
this
to
students
with
online
school
right
now,
it
is
very
helpful
with
my
eye
fatigue
as
am
always
on

avevo
un
massaggiatore
per
occhi
da
tempo,
ma
si
è
rotto,
così
ho
acquistato
questo
appena
lo
ho
provato
sono
rimasta
piacevolmente
attratta
dalla
musica,
che
nel
vecchio
non

porque
el
notar

si
te
la
colocas

relajas
es
una
gozada
pues
te

estoy
usándola
casi
todos
los
días
desde
que
me
la
enviaron
this
is
one
of
the
best
product
,
have
bought
first
impressions
well
made
,
good
quality
,
feels
fantastic
dunno
if
its
going
to
resolve
any
of
your
problems
for
dry
eyes
or
dark
circles
but
it
can
definitely
put
you
to
sleep
reduce
headaches
and
relaxes
you
am
using
it
every
single
day
just
can't
do
without
it
anymore

ou

avec
ce
produit
petits
bémols
que
ai
personnellement
rencontré
contrairement
aux
autres
testeur
de
mon
entourage,
au
dégonflement
:
appui
sur
les
arcades
dérangeant,
et
poche
en
contact
avec
le
visage
en
plastique
serait
plus
agréable
en
mousse
et
tissu
doux
je
pense
de
plus,
dommage
que
on
ne
puisse
pas
choisir
le
type
de
massage
soi
même
car
durant
les
min
de
massage,
différents
massages
enchaînent
et
certains
plus
agréables
que
autres
selon
les
goûts
mais
moi
et
mes
proches
avons
presque
tous
réussi
à
nous
endormir
à
la
fin
du
massage
tellement
les
bien
faits
sont
parfaits
have
really
enjoyed
using
the
eye
massager
so
far
the
unit
itself
looks
very
sleek
and
wellbuilt
the
massager
is
comfortable
to
wear
and
doesn
leave
any
marks
the
pressure
on
the
eyes
takes
some
getting
used
to
at
first
but
the
combination
of
pressure,
heat,
and
prerecorded
nature
sounds
help
create
very
relaxing
experience
being
able
to
connect
to
device
via
bluetooth
is
nice
bonus
but
think
actually
enjoy
the
nature
sounds
moreoverall,
this
is
worthwhile
addition
to
my
health
routine
and
glad
gave
this
product
try
it
helps
with
my
sleep
and
would
highly
recommended
it
very
well
designed,
comfortable
to
use,
touch
control
is
easy
&
precise,
temperature
&
air
pressure
sets
nicely
bit
smelly
when
first
opened
but
not
as
irritating
&
believe
it
will
go
away
in
no
time
noise
from
the
air
pump
is
far
from
being
annoying
and
i'm
not
wearing
it
to
sleep
anyway
it's
"one
size
fits
all",
so
slight
tunning
in
position
can
make
big
difference
bought
this
in
apprehension
on
whether
it
would
actually
do
anything
to
my
surprise
it
came
well
packaged
and
ready
to
use;
was
chargedplaced
it
over
my
eyes,
strap
at
the
back
of
my
head,
switched
it
on
in
default
mode
and
was
so
relaxing
especially
with
our
newborn,
this
is
so
handy
for
us,
especially
since
this
is
rechargeable;
no
wasting
of
batteriesthe
bluetooth
function
for
listening
to
music
or
podcasts
is
bonus
for
mei
would
definitely
recommend
this
to
anyone
looking
to
go
into
their
own
shell
and
chill
out;
good
alternative
or
supplement
to
meditating
this
thing
is
life
saver
have
an
eye
disorder
and
use
this
massager
multiple
times
day
even
use
it
in
the
bath
the
only
negative
thing
about
it
is
the
buttons
are
hard
to
navigate
when
you
already
have
the
mask
on
it
is
really
great
product,
very
user
friendly,
the
heat,
the
massage
is
very
comfortable
my
other
friends
said
they
can
even
fall
asleep
whenever
they
use
it
one
of
my
friend
who
has
dry
eyes
problem
said
her
symptom
improves
right
away
the
first
time
she
tried
out
the
product
at
my
other
friend's
house
she
then
ordered
one
for
herself
and
she's
been
using
it
everyday
can't
say
enough
how
much
me
and
my
family
love
this
product
thank
you
really
enjoy
this
sleep
mask
don
use
it
while
sleeping
and
am
not
fan
of
any
vibration
massage
products
but
the
air
pressure
and
heat
are
very
relaxing
use
this
product
almost
daily
before
sleep
and
sometimes
during
short
breaks
at
work
the
air
pressure
sound
took
little
getting
used
to
but
now
for
me,
the
sound
itself
is
also
relaxing
the
bluetooth
controls
are
easier
to
use
before
putting
the
mask
on
and
switching
massage
modes
is
easy
and
intuitive
so
wasn't
really
sure
how
well
this
product
would
work
received
it
timely
and
as
luck
would
have
it,
worked
long
day
in
front
of
the
computer
my
eyes
were
tired
used
the
vitality
setting
and
wow
it
actually
helped
love
the
variety
of
settings
and
the
little
bit
of
heat
will
be
using
these
daily
to
rejuvenate
nice
product
but
it
don't
hold
it's
charge
so
have
to
keep
it
on
charge
to
use
it
thinking
of
send
it
backupdate
didn't
use
it
times
and
not
working
anymore
sad
cause
like
how
it
works
returned
it
my
advice,
don't
buy
it
not
worth
the
price
enjoyed
many
things
about
renpho's
eye
massager
straight
out
the
package
the
device
came
charged
so
that
was
efficient
the
design
of
this
product
very
nice,
and
compact
like
how
you
can
fold
it
up
and
not
worry
about
it
occupying
so
much
space
this
product
is
very
easy
to
use,
just
have
to
power
it
on
and
it
starts
working
immediately
it
also
comes
with
many
options,
such
as
changing
the
heat
temperature,
the
different
modes
for
massaging
and
etc
overall,
this
product
is
really
relaxing
and
works
great
my
husband
works
long
hours
in
front
of
multiple
computer
screens
and
was
recently
complaining
about
tired/twitchy
eyes,
so
we
ordered
this
product
to
see
if
it
would
help
we
each
took
turns
enjoying
0minute
session
while
simply
lying
back
in
recliner
definitely
unique
feeling
at
first;
however,
after
few
minutes,
we
both
found
it
to
be
very
relaxing
experience
we
were
both
pleased
with
the
end
results
and
are
now
planning
to
make
it
before
bedtime
routine
to
help
us
fall
asleep
faster
as
well

only
gave
it
stars
because
the

are
hard
to
use
it
lags
or
something
when
skiping
through
the
function
settings
and
you
have
to
go
through
the
list
againalso,
don't
see
any
difference
better
the
main
settings
only
sleep
mode
is
different
because
it
doesn't
play
the
music
also
the
bluetooth
speaker
isn't
vary
loud,
its
better
to
just
play
music
off
my
phone
instead
of
connecting
to
bluetooth

months
and
my
workload
has
increased
i'm
constantly
in

my
eyes
start
hurting
around
lunch
time
on
my
lunch
break
quickly
use

for

product
love
how
easy
it
is
to
use
and
an
effective
it
is
with
helping
you
relax,
use
it
almost
every
night
after
work
or
before
bed
thinking
of
ordering
few
more
for
family
and
to
have
one
at
work
works
as
advertised
it
has
air
pockets
inside
that
inflate
and
massage
certain
areas
of
the
faceit
is
little
bit
noisy
but
there
is
music
so
its
not
bothering
that
much
its
too
big
and
too
loudthe
only
good
thing
about
this
is
that
you
can
adjust
anything
you
want,
for
all
programsbut
unfortunately
its
just
too
big
for
my
eyes
and
my
head
and
my
eyes
are
not
that
small,
can
say
they
are
regular
size
abd
the
air
pump
is
just
too
loud
llegó
en
perfectas
condiciones,
pero
al
cabo
de
unos
dias
de
uso,
perdio
portencia,
contactamos
directamente
con
el
vendedor,
se
hicieron
responsables
asi
que
muy
bienfuera
de
ese
pequeño
inconveniente,
es
un
buen
producto,
cumple
su
cometido
the
first
minute
wore
the
mask
wasn't
sure
about
it,
but
the
longer
wore
it
the
more
liked
it
it
warms
your
eyes
and
massages
with
air
pressure
around
the
sides
or
your
head
and
it
feels
great
i've
never
had
an
eye
massage
before
and
love
it,
very
cool
item,
great
for
gift
for
those
people
who
have
everything
bet
you
don't
have
an
eye
massager
;
ordered
this
for
myself
but
my
husband
has
taken
control
of
it
it
surprisingly
comforting
and
soothing
for
an
electronic
device
personally
love
the
sound
of
the
air
pockets
filling
up
and
then
releasing
it
very
satisfying
:note:
read
the
instructions
to
understand
the
different
modes
works
surprisingly
very
well
was
quite
skeptical
at
first
but
it
really
does
help
after
long
day
on
the
computer
it's
very
relaxing,
comfortable,
and
the
music
is
soothing
just
wish
the
controls
were
little
better
but
can
live
with
that
this
thing
is
awesome
sometimes
fall
asleep
after
few
minutes
didn't
know
how
much
needed
this
until
got
it
the
elastic
head
band
makes
it
so
it
is
tight
fit
but
it
can
be
uncomfortable
one
the
ears
tutto
bello,
rilassante
il
massaggio,
peccato
per
la
rumorosità
è
troppo
rumoroso
se
non
fosse
per
quello
stelle
la
musica
relax
di
sottofondo
farete
fatica
sentirla
parte
questo
difetto,
il
massaggio
è
ottimo
