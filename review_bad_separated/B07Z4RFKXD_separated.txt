良い
the
price
of
this
product
is
very
reasonable
how
what
you
get
the
unit
feels
not
super
sturdy
when
you
open
it
up
however
once
installed
it
feels
pretty
solid
the
hinge
locks
very
well,
the
part
that
holds
the
phone
feels
little
flimsy
when
putting
the
phone
in
but
once
the
phone
is
in,
it
holds
it
well
and
am
not
worried
about
it
coming
out
the
phone
am
using
is
old
iphone0
with
an
otterbox
commuter
on
it,
with
no
issue
it
can
definitely
hold
larger
phone
as
well
the
extra
phone
stand
that
comes
with
it
is
very
sturdy
and
use
that
for
my
other
devices
the
usb
cord
that
comes
with
it
to
connect
the
controller
to
the
phone
is
useless
to
me
because
only
have
iphones
and
the
cable
is
usb
to
usb
fits
my
ps0
controller
perfectly,
holds
my
galaxy
note
0+
perfectly
my
phone
is
large,
and
with
the
otterbox
on
it
it's
very
heavy
turned
my
controller
upside
down
to
see
if
my
phone
would
fall
out
and
it
stayed
in
place
it's
good
idea
to
not
have
your
case
on
while
playing
with
mounted
phone,
because
holding
the
controller
is
pretty
heavy
that's
no
fault
of
the
mount,
though
highly
recommend
this
product
for
fellow
gamers
all
ports
and
buttons
on
the
controller
are
accessible
while
this
mount
is
on
just
be
gentle
while
installing
it,
and
be
gentle
while
inserting
or
removing
your
phone
so
far
it
seems
durable
and
reliable
enough
comes
with
short
double
ended
micro
usb
cable
so
you
can
charge
your
controller,
but
that's
no
good
to
me
as
new
samsung
phones
use
usbc
either
way,
five
stars
from
me
debated
buying
mobile
controller
before
found
this
and
i'm
glad
didn't
this
thing
uses
the
well
developed
tech
of
your
dualshock
and
allows
you
to
use
it
comfortably
on
your
phone
it
is
very
secure
and
snaps
in
place
played
call
of
duty
mobile
on
this
and
it
was
just
too
easy,
got
nukes
basically
every
game
lol
since
the
ps0
controller
works
very
well
on
emulators
too
didn't
have
to
set
up
any
controls
at
all,
it
just
knew
what
it
was
on
my
n0,
ds
and
gba
emulators
have
never
been
one
for
mobile
gaming
until
now
after
receiving
this
in
the
mail
was
blown
away
about
how
easy
it
was
to
set
up
and
use
instead
of
now
arguing
with
my
girlfriend
on
whether
we
were
going
to
watch
tv
or
play
games
can
simply
turn
on
my
gaming
console
pair
it
with
my
phone
and
hook
it
up
with
my
controller
thanks
to
this
attachment
great
purchase
and
even
better
price
would
be
crazy
to
own
this
if
you
are
gamer
it's
an
absolute
game
changer
would
have
been
great
product
had
it
actually
shown
up
thought
the
package
felt
bvery
light
upon
inspection
noticed
the
bag
felt
completely
empty
after
opening
it
is
empty
and
the
product
purchased
is
nowhere
to
be
seen
terrible
do
not
recommend
this
seller
at
all
i'm
thrilled
this
worked
out
exactly
as
had
hoped
it
fits
perfectly
is
not
invasive
at
all,
and
fits
my
phone
have
pixel
0xl
with
esr
clear
case
connected
via
bluetooth
was
bit
concerned
about
how
the
volume
buttons
are
near
the
center
of
the
phone
however,
setting
it
tad
off
center
worked
perfectly
fine
and
no
complaints
on
it
seeming
too
much
to
the
left
this
was
one
of
the
biggest
concerns
purchasing
and
it's
nonissue
tbhtwo
minor
things
would
comment
aboutfirst:
noticed
some
of
the
low
ratings
mentioning
it
broke
easily
and
it
felt
like
it
was
going
to
break
while
installing
it
the
instructions
on
the
box
find
are
missing
the
most
critical
part
had
to
use
youtube
video
to
make
sure
did
it
right
the
process
followed
did
not
make
me
feel
was
about
to
break
it
in
any
way:
set
the
top
of
the
clip
first
and
hold
it
down
in
place,
then
bring
in
the
bottom
the
bottom
is
supposed
to
click
over
the
top
piecesecond:
it's
obviously
going
to
feel
top
heavy
due
to
the
phone's
weight,
so
you
can
feel
it
on
your
wrists
bit
it
would
be
interesting
if
it
were
possible
to
somehow
add
more
weight
to
the
unfortunately
would
drive
up
the
price
clip
to
help
centralize
the
weightoverall,
highly
recommend
use
this
for
games
on
my
device
itself
and
for
steam
remote
play
holds
my
pixel
0a
and
lg
g0
fine
with
no
issues,
secures
onto
dualshock
easily
and
doesn't
feel
like
it's
going
to
break
or
fall
offmy
one
issue
which
would
expect
to
be
the
same
issue
with
all
similar
ones
and
will
vary
with
each
phone
is
the
phone
holder
covers
and
pushes
down
on
my
volume
button
when
phone
is
located
centrally
in
the
holder,
have
to
have
my
pixel
phone
abit
to
the
side,
my
lg
g0
it
presses
in
the
google
assist
button
but
with
the
phone
still
in
my
case
it
doesn't
seem
to
push
the
button
down
to
activate
it
so
can
the
phone
in
the
middleto
sum
up
for
the
price
you
can't
go
wrong,
because
now
game
more
on
my
phone
because
of
this
device
and
xbox
game
pass
im
happy
to
invest
more
into
the
razer
kishi
update:
seller
contacted
me
and
insisted
on
sending
me
free
ps0
accessory
to
compensate
in
which
receivedthis
product
came
open
and
with
dirt,
like
dried
mud
on
the
stand
also
the
plastic
feels
extremely
cheap
like
it
won't
last
too
long,
probably
won't
use
this
in
places
other
than
my
bed
or
couch
with
fears
of
it
falling
or
the
clip
giving
way
this
feels
like
$0
producta
few
positives
have
to
say
are
it
does
as
advertised,
and
the
clamp
down
on
the
phone
feels
snug
enough
to
hold
and
the
stand
is
okaydefinitely
won't
get
another
one
when
this
breaks,
not
if,
when
so
been
using
this
with
my
cell
phone
and
ps0
controller,
it
works
great
and
do
like
that
this
has
clip
that
will
lock
it
into
place,
other
ones
never
had
those
so
it
would
just
sit
on
the
controller
this
one
you
can
move
around
and
the
clip
will
stay
this
works
really
well
it
pretty
tight
fit
and
worry
about
breaking
it
whenever
we
put
it
on,
but
it
been
good
so
far
it
holds
my
husbands
iphone
plus
phone
well
on
his
ps0
controller
it
sturdy
and
the
phone
does
not
fall
down
good
product,
would
buy
again
prosfits
nicely
on
ds0comes
with
separate
standadjustable
mountcons
looks
like
an
opened
boxthe
durability
is
questionable
but
time
will
tell
controller
mount
is
fine
once
it
properly
secured
bit
of
hassle
to
take
off
added
phone
stand
is
nice
and
really
only
thing
ve
been
using
in
general
remote
play
is
not
very
good
ve
been
using
mine
for
months
and
am
very
happy
with
it
took
it
off
and
put
it
back
on
as
needed,
no
change
still
the
same
as
when
took
it
out
of
the
box
not
very
expensive
compared
to
othersand
allows
me
to
be
more
confortable
while
playing
&
take
break
of
my
glasses
perfect
the
box
arrived
damage
like
it
was
torn
upon
before
shipping,
the
plastic
art
that
goes
over
the
controller
feels
extremely
fragile
and
over
all
that,
it
doesn't
fit
it's
missing
something
like
0mm
to
clip
and
no
matter
how
hard
tried
to
clip
it,
it
doesn't
feeling
ripped
off,
maybe
it's
jut
me
its
great
product
it
is
exactly
what
it
said
in
the
description
have
an
iphone
xr
with
thick
cover,
and
it
holds
it
very
well
the
incline
adjustment
is
amazing
there
product
itself
is
well
made
and
very
simple
to
use
would
recommend
this
product
to
everyone
wanting
to
use
ps0
controller
on
an
iphone
looking
at
it,
it
can
hold
all
iphones
including
covers
it
was
bought
for
kids
and
the
kids
are
very
happy
with
it
small
in
size
but
great
in
functions
compared
to
its
price
it's
really
good
very
stable
and
steady

this
didn't
work
for
me,
the
plastic
shell
could
not
stay
closed
making
it
useless
it
just
could
not
hold
up
my
phone
without
opening
bought
this
to
play
doom
and
gta
in
my
downtime
at
work
works
great,
very
easy
to
connect
it
does
work
but
feels
like
it's
going
to
break
the
plastic
is
extremely
cheap
feeling
works
great
also
comes
with
free
adjustable
phone
stand
so
you
can
play
with
the

depending

worth
it
for

price
no
good,
son
couldn't
even
use
it
once
just
falls
off
the
controller
works
great
just
give
it
good
push
when
installing
would
be
nice
if
there
was
way
to
secure
it
to
controller
pretty
useless
design
great
product
and
very
sturdy
love
this
item
for
remote
play
around
the
house
and
just
what
was
looking
for
strong
build
and
nice
clip
on
design
the
mount
can
hold
any
weight
to
it
on
the
controller,
it
will
latch
onto
your
phone
good
but
fall
off
the
controller
itself
threw
it
in
the
garbage
the
day
got
it
waste
of
money
great
product
use
it
with
my
ps0
controller
and
samsung
s0plus
phone
can
play
my
ps0
anywhere
around
the
house
well
worth
the
purchase
simply
doesn't
work,
phone
fits,
fits
on
the
ps0
controller
however,
no
way
for
for
the
'clip'
to
clip
in
waste
of
money,
stay
away
good
value
for
the
money,
if
you
play
fortnight
or
cod
mobile
it
works
like
charm
seems
sturdy,
have
used
for
several
hours
at
this
point
and
have
had
no
problems,
this
was
exactly
what
was
looking
for
really
worked
great
it
is
hard
material
and
good
at
fitting
with
ps0
controller
on
the
picture
the
cable
is
type
and
micro
tho
its
not,
its
micro
to
micro
now
got
to
pay
another
0$
for
cable
not
worth
it
if
you

simply
doesn't
work
as
you
can
see
in
the
video
posted
as
soon
as
you
put
the
phone
on
the
clamp
the
whole
thing
comes
apart
the
mount
doesn't
actually
click
together
like
the
product
description
says
the
two
plastic
sides
just
fold
into
each
other
but
don't
lock
together
at
all
and
as
such
cannot
support
any
weight
i'm
left
wondering
if
was
sent
different
product
or
somethingfor
anyone
who
gave
this
thing
star
review
could
you
tell
me
if
your
mount
is
different
from
mine
in
the
video
have
no
choice
but
to
return
mineupdate:
discovered
that
the
mount
actually
will
click
together
the
problem
is
that
you
have
to
push
the
plastic
so
hard
felt
like
was
going
to
break
it
you
need
to
push
the
top
tab
underneath
the
bottom
piece
until
it
locks
together
it
wasn't
easy
now
that
it's
locked
in
place
it's
very
tight
so
don't
plan
on
taking
it
off
again
if
don't
have
to
it
does
work
as
described
now
so
will
raise
my
rating,
but
it
would
have
been
helpful
if
some
instructions
were
included
to
let
you
know
that
you
are
in
fact
supposed
to
push
the
plastic
that
hard
bought
this
and
the
one
sold
by
icespring
to
compare
they
are
the
exact
same,
but
oivo
this
one
throws
in
an
extra
phone
kickstand
in
case
you
don't
want
to
use
to
mount
everytime,
but
it
was
about
$0
more
for
that
one:this
one:
$0oivo
with
phone
stand:
$0both
come
with
mount
plus
microusb
to
micro
usb
cable
kind
of
outdated
it
would
be
nice
to
see
typec
to
microusb
cableboth
products
being
the
same,
they
work
great,
just
be
careful
attaching
the
mount
and
detaching
the
mount
on
your
controller,
the
plastic
seems
fragile
it
might
be
wise
to
leave
it
on
the
controller
as
much
as
possible
to
avoid
breaking
the
clamp
the
plastics
feel
sturdy
enough
as
long
as
you
don't
force
it
to
do
something
it
wasn't
meant
to
do
otherwise
this
is
great
stand
for
remote
play
or
using
your
ps0
controller
for
your
phone
just
like
the
title
says
it
is
controller
clip
holder
does
not
come
with
the
controllerthat
being
said
this
is
such
solid
controller
holder
that
also
attaches
to
your
mobile
phone
using
the
iphone
xs
max
and
it
fits
perfectly,
it
has
an
adjustable
slider
that
will
most
likely
fit
any
phone
it
simple
but
so
effective
and
once
positioned
it
is
firm
and
will
not
move
little
bonus
comes
with
it
too,
with
kick
stand
so
that
when
you
set
the
phone
down
it
will
stay
stable
this
is
unlike
lot
of
other
phone
holders
where
it
does
not
have
kickstand
and
as
soon
as
you
put
it
down
the
unbalanced
weight
kicks
it
over
that
what
makes
this
product
so
unique
and
well
worth
the
price
star
because
it
gives
you
the
full
package
plus
the
little
details
in
the
product
make
it
perfect
for
anyone
that
just
need
the
controller
holder
excellent
product
was
using
ps
vita
for
long
time
specifically
for
ps0
remote
play
can
happily
say
have
sold
that
vita
and
am
using
my
note
0+,
an
officially
licensed
ps0
controller,
and
ps0
controller
phone
remote
play
mount,
oivo
ps0
controller
clip
clamp
mount
holder
with
adjustable
stand
for
playstation
controller
stand
for
all
my
mobile
ps0
needsthe
mount
is
exactly
what
it
needs
to
be,
lightweight,
easy
to
attach
and
remove,
adjustable
the
controller
portion
fits
snuggly
around
the
controller
and
takes
bit
of
work
to
snap
closed,
but
only
because
it
needs
to
be
tight
so
as
not
flop
around
the
phone
portion
easily
expands
to
fit
my
note
0+,
adjusts
and
locks
in
place
with
just
couple
of
twists
of
the
plastic
boltsi'm
really
happy
with
this
and
i'll
probably
just
keep
this
in
the
car
attached
to
the
controller
so
always
have
my
ps0
with
me
was
delivered
in
bag
so
as
you
can
see
from
first
pic
box
is
squashed
and
looks
like
either
company
packaging
failed
as
box
not
filled
correctly
but
product
came
out
ok
and
tried
on
controller
and
fits
snug
and
perfectlylast
pic
shows
lock
which
is
you
slide
the
bottom
over
top
and
the
lip
holds
it
closed
thin
plastic
here
so
taking
off
and
on
will
probably
wear
it
down
so
try
to
leave
attached
if
possibleoverall
very
happy
with
product
besides
packaging
and
works
well
holding
my
one
plus
pro
phone
with
apple
arcade
being
thing
now
quickly
got
tired
of
the
fact
that
couldn't
play
game
in
bed
easily
because
there
was
no
place
to
rest
my
phone
and
hold
controller
so
lazy
right
finally
purchased
this
guy
even
though
few
of
the
other
reviews
on
here
drew
me
away
couple
times
honestly,
had
no
issues
attaching
this
to
my
ps
controller
took
it
off
and
reattached
it
few
times
just
to
see
what
all
the
fuss
was
about,
and
how
no
trouble
whatsoever
am
not
sure
where
the
disconnect
is
for
people
installing
this,
but
it
really
wasn't
that
difficultthe
plastic
that
wraps
around
the
controller
does
feel
little
less
sturdy
than
the
rest
of
the
mount,
but
get
that
it
keeps
lower
profile
if
the
plastic
was
thicker
think
it
would
make
the
controller
more
bulky
and
be
even
harder
to
installi
also
like
how
the
phone
mount
adjusts
it's
not
just
clamp
that
tightens
down
there
seems
to
be
little
notches
inside
that
hold
it
in
place
if
you
loosen
it
just
enough
it
clicks
as
you
turn
itthis
is
totally
worth
it
for
the
price
and
it's
fairly
comfortable
will
say
that
it
can
get
annoying
to
hold
after
while
supporting
the
weight
of
the
phone
on
the
mount
there
weren't
any
reviews
for
this
when
bought
it,
but
gave
it
chance
anyway
minimal
packaging,
in
very
good
way
thing
seems
sturdy
enough
holds
my
caseless
iphone
pro
no
problem
would
recommend
initially
would
not
fit
on
the
ps0
controller,
it
wouldn't
click
to
get
it
to
lock
noticed
that
the
plastic
surrounding
the
joysticks
were
bit
wide,
lifting
that
clip
part
just
tiny
bit
so
the
whole
lock
thing
on
the
front
wouldn't
work
with
the
use
of
cutter,
trimmed
that
part
on
both
sides
which
helped
solved
the
problem
mentioned
above
after
doing
that,
was
able
to
make
it
lock
on
the
front
part
tested
it
with
phone
with
case
and
it
was
able
to
hold
the
weight
would
have
been
stars
if
it
didn't
have
that
issue
mentioned
the
bonus
phone
holder/stand
is
nice
first
of
all
want
to
thank
amazon
for
this
gift
this
is
great
fit
super
easy
to
put
on,
won
the
first
dozen
games
played
cod
mobile
and
viewing
the
screen
was
superb
it
also
comes
with
separate
stand
which
utilized
to
hold
the
phone
to
view
other
things
on
the
phone
can
also
be
used
on
night
table
to
hold
the
phone
upright
the
price,
great,
the
quality
is
good,
just
don't
start
droping
it
holds
the
phone
just
right
adjustable
view
to
play
games
with
the
controllerhope
this
helps
first
off
like
this
phone
mount
now
that
i've
figured
it
out
out
of
the
box
it
took
me
few
mins
to
figure
out
how
to
get
it
on
my
ps0
controller
once
did
i'm
happy
with
it
that
being
said,
the
plastic
clip
does
feel
very
cheap
and
not
very
durable
i'm
worried
that
if
take
it
off
and
on
very
much
it
might
break
the
top
part
that
holds
the
phone
does
good
job
my
galaxy
s0e
feels
secure
the
extra
stand
is
nice
if
you
don't
want
to
have
the
weight
of
your
phone
and
you
have
somewhere
else
to
set
it
overall
for
the
price
it
is
good
mount
and
would
recommend
it
to
my
friendsnote:
the
cable
it
comes
with
does
not
work
with
my
phone
product
itself
works
fine
kind
of
pain
in
the
rear
to
click
together
without
pressing
the
ps
button
but
whateverthe
reason
ordered
this
one
is
due
to
the
misleading
pictures
in
the
first
picture
it
clearly
shows
usba
to
usbc
cable
so
knew
could
simply
plug
it
in
to
any
newer
android
phone
great
right
no,
what
actually
came
is
usba
to
usba
which
phones
haven't
used
for
yearsi'll
be
keeping
the
product
because
it
works,
but
i'm
leaving
at
star
due
to
misleading
pictures
won't
be
purchasing
from
this
company
again
due
to
this
fact
alone,
even
if
their
products
themselves
are
good
just
got
this
clip
an
hour
or
so
ago
and
already
will
have
to
return
it
don
understand
how
they
ever
thought
such
small
piece
of
plastic
would
be
enough
to
hold
the
entire
clip
in
placeit
doesn
even
work
without
my
phone
in
the
clip
idk
if
mine
was
just
missing
piece
or
whatbut
horrible
everything
otherwise
the
product
is
pretty
decent
and
it's
also
relatively
well
made
but
the
issue
have
is
the
wrong
usb
cable
was
either
sent
or
its
misleading
picture
it
looks
like
usb
micro
to
usb
but
was
sent
micro
to
micro
considering
it's
not
i'm
little
disappointed
but
it's
an
easy
fix
if
you
have
the
same
issue
you
can
get
one
on
amazon
for
$0
so
all
in
all
it's
not
too
bad
do
wish
it
supported
bit
more
weight
though
feels
bit
cumbersome
in
my
opinion
the
item
came
defective
and
unable
to
secure
to
the
ps0
controller
there
is
no
way
for
the
plastic
to
click
in
to
attach
and
therefore
you
can
not
use
very
disappointed
boy
this
was
gift
and
when
given,
it
says
the
window
of
return
has
closed
would
like
credit
or
replacement
so
far
its
been
holding
up
and
doing
what
is
suppose
to
do
which
is
wellto
hold
your
phone
on
your
ps0
controller
haven
had
any
issues
with
it
so
far
the
material
it
is
made
out
of
is
sturdy
plastic,
but
still
be
careful
with
it
it
feels
like
if
drop
it,
it
will
break
so
do
be
carefuli
ve
been
using
it
with
steam
link
to
play
games
while
on
the
couch
or
just
chilling
with
my
family
its
pretty
much
feels
like
playing
gameboy
just
much
more
advancepeople
say
they
have
trouble
putting
it
on
and
thats
because
it
makes
sure
to
be
snug
fit
on
the
controller
remove
all
additional
accessories
on
your
ps0
controller
to
make
sure
it
will
go
on
not
sure
what
"thickness"
has
to
do
this
but
the
"sturdiness"
and
"value
for
money"
are
on
point
the
clip
snaps
in
place
and
wraps
around
the
ps0
controller
snuggly
without
getting
in
the
way
of
console
gameplaywhat
also
drew
me
to
purchasing
this
one
from
the
others
sold
was
that
phone
stand
was
also
included
it
might
not
sound
like
much,
but
for
the
same
price
as
the
others
this
was
deciding
factor
for
menow
that
my
kids
see
mine,
they
want
one
for
their
very
own
so
it
looks
like
more
are
going
straight
into
my
cart
purchased
this
to
have
way
to
mount
my
iphone
to
my
ds0
controller
to
play
my
ps0
remotely
the
build
quality
doesn't
add
much
extra
bulk
to
your
ds0
having
the
excess
weight
of
the
phone
on
top
of
my
controller
was
bit
odd
at
first,
but
it
felt
natural
before
long
you
can
only
connect
via
the
cable
if
your
iphone
is
jailbroken,
but
bluetooth
connection
is
just
fine
with
me
product
arrived
advertised
and
fit
my
model
cuhzct0u
just
take
your
time
clipping
it
together
as
it
is
really
snug
as
it
should
be
holds
my
oneplus
0t
just
fine
even
have
kick
stand
behind
my
phone
and
the
holder
has
enough
width
to
hold
it
absolutely
terrible
product
the
bottom
portion
of
the
product
works
perfectly
fine
and
actually
holds
the
ps0
controller
quite
well
the
trouble
comes
with
the
top
piece,
it
does
not
physically
connect
to
the
bottom
piece
so
when
you
place
your
phone
in
the
clip,
it
just
goes
flying
back
rendering
this
product
completely
useless
seek
an
alternative,
and
don't
waste
your
money
on
this
one
this
product
works
well
enough
to
hold
my
note
0+
onto
my
ps0
controller
the
stand
is
just
strong
enough
to
hold
my
phone
upright
however,
the
description
says
it
comes
with
microusb
to
usbc
cable,
which
it
does
not
it
came
with
microusb
to
microusb
reached
out
to
the
seller,
but
got
no
response,
so
returned
the
item,
since
cannot
charge
the
controller
from
my
phone
with
the
old
cable
connector
this
product
is
cheap
cheaply
made,
not
very
thought
out,
but
works
as
advertised
sturdiness
is
very
odd
as
when
you
close
the
pieces
together,
you
feel
like
you're
going
to
break
it
once
it's
in
place
though,
it
ain't
going
anywhere,
and
tightening
the
phone
mount
keeps
it
secure
in
place,
even
with
my
heavy
ass
deviceneed
something
quick
and
inexpensive,
not
bad
choice
if
you
have
an
iphone
or
phone
with
usbc
the
included
micro
usb
is
useless
look
into
the
amazon
basics
micro
to
usbc
or
iphone
cable
to
replace
itthe
included
phone
stand
is
nice
when
you
don't
want
to
clip
the
phone
to
controller,
like
playing
at
your
desk
really
like
this
mount
it
even
comes
with
separate
stand
to
put
on
flat
surface
it
easy
to
snap
to
your
controller
and
easy
to
take
off,
unlike
other
mounts
that
are
really
hard
to
snap
on
and
feel
like
they
are
going
to
break
use
this
with
my
iphone
with
an
otter
case
works
like
charm
go
ahead
and
get
this
clips
into
my
controller
just
fine
with
no
issues
have
galaxy
note0+
with
the
protective
cover
on
it
it
does
put
some
weight
on
my
controller
so
would
have
adjust
the
clip
like
how
it
is
in
the
picture
so
my
phone
does
fall
off
use
this
to
play
cod
mobile
with
it
read
the
fine
print
the
device
does
not
come
with
micro
usb
to
usbc
as
*prominently*
displayed
twice
in
separate
photos
literally
the
whole
reason
chose
this
one
over
another
brand
as
for
the
product
itself,
your
going
to
have
to
be
gentle
with
it
my
samsung
galaxy
makes
it
little
top
heavy
so
it's
lot
of
strain
on
the
plastic
screws
holding
it
in
place
it's
about
$0
product
this
thing
is
wonderful
broke
my
knee
few
days
before
bought
it,
and
needed
it
for
ps0
remote
play
on
my
phonethe
adjustability
is
fantastic,
and
it
locks
in
place
and
holds
my
note
enough
that
i've
never
had
to
worry
about
it
falling
on
my
face
and
can
get
just
the
right
anglemy
knee
is
healed
now,
and
still
primarily
use
this
just
so
can
play
games
in
the
same
room
as
my
significant
other
highly
recommend
it
everything
about
this
is
perfect
have
an
iphone
with
an
otter
box
rounded
case
and
worried
about
it
not
fitting
and
surprising
it
just
barely
fits
but
don
have
to
force
it
at
all
my
phone
though
is
little
heavy
which
does
make
the
controller
heavy
and
you
have
to
get
used
to
that
but
other
than
that
great
product
broke
after
using
it
three
times
am
always
careful
with
everything
ever
buy
because
not
about
wasting
money
the
plastic
is
super
weak
where
it
clamps
together
had
the
company
used
thicker
plastic
or
even
metal,
this
would
ve
been
an
a+
product
what
received
looks
exactly
like
the
pictures,
only
it
will
not
stay
on
my
controller
when
holding
my
phone
look
elsewhere
for
solution,
this
is
not
it
edit:
the
seller
reached
out
to
and
offered
replacement
or
refund
purchased
the
item
for
my
son
to
play
call
of
duty
mobile
he
doesn't
play
it
anymore,
so
don't
need
another
one
but
appreciate
good
customer
serviceoriginal:purchased
it
for
my
son,
he
said
it
doesn't
work
for
him
he
said
it
constantly
falls,
never
stays
up
it
works
well,
it
better
than
the
madcatz
version
with
the
rubber
band
straps
still
little
hard
to
clip
the
clamp
back
once
on
the
controller
other
than
that
it
is
definitely
the
best
version
have
used
so
far
first
of
all
it
works
the
only
downside
for
me
it's
that
it
only
comes
with
micro
usb
instead
of
type
usb
because
let's
be
honest
now
days
most
of
smartphones
are
type
usb
so
that's
what
kills
it
for
me
but
other
than
that
it
works
can
no
longer
charge
my
sony
dual
shock
controller
with
my
sony
charging
dock
station
due
to
the
usb
port
dongle
adapter
interference
after
putting
on
this
clipaside
from
that
so
far
its
ok
using
my
phone
like
mini
gaming
device
is
awesome
whats
not
awesome
the
lack
of
games
that
work
with
my
ps0
controller,
that
are
fun
to
play
also
the
weight
of
everything
when
all
connected
is
like
toting
small
kitten
everywhere
you
go
this
came
in
real
perfect
for
my
son
while
we
re
driving
he
can
hook
his
ps0
controller
up
to
his
phone
and
clean
and
keep
quiet
while
doing
my
errands
hoping
that
the
ps
five
controller
will
fit
this
fits
my
ps0
controller
great,
but
the
plastic
is
flimsy
however
they
installed
couple
of
knobs,
one
on
each
side
so
you
can
tighten
or
loosen
whenever
you
want
to
change
the
position
of
the
holder
this
product
clearly
shows
micro
usb
to
usbc
cable
but
you
get
micro
usb
to
micro
usb
if
you
have
modern
phone,
you'll
be
buying
separate
cable
bought
this
as
gift
for
my
friend
and
he
says
it
holds
his
new
iphone
really
well,
apparently
lot
of
these
type
of
holders
don
ti
ve
witnessed
it
being
dropped
and
still
gripping
the
phone
few
times
so
impressed
by
it
good
intentions,
but
doesn't
work
for
my
phone
at
all
my
phone
literally
doesn't
even
stay
in
it,
so
to
try
and
play
game
is
pointless
the
phone
falls
out
almost
instantly
tired
broke
as
soon
as
clipped
on
controller
not
sure
if
any
of
these
mounts
can
support
the
weight
of
newer
bigger
phones
your
browser
does
not
support
html0
video
great
product
you
will
need
to
make
it
stay
onto
the
charger
because
the
phone
is
heavy,
kept
coming
undone
so
super
clued
it
but
eventually
it
will
come
apart
again
this
definitely
did
the
job
well,
it
holds
your
phone
on
the
ps0
controller
without
feeling
like
it'll
slip
off
but
suggest
using
on
controller
you
can
keep
it
on,
because
it
cracked
when
removed
it
from
the
controller
after
about
week
knowing
this
i'll
probably
buy
another
and
just
leave
it
on
one
of
my
spare
controllers
being
able
to
adjust
the
angle
is
huge
bought
an
xbox
one
variation
that
doesn't
adjust
far
enough
for
my
preference
other
than
that
wouldn't
recommend
taking
this
on/off
your
ps0
controller
too
often
given
how
thin
the
plastic
is
that
wraps
locks
on
the
controller
it
includes
phone
stand
like
the
design
but
it
might
be
little
tricky
to
snap
on
since
you
really
have
to
use
pressure
and
it
thin
plastic
other
than
that,
works
as
intended
was
not
able
to
close
the
controller
clamp
around
my
controller,
it
has
not
way
of
securing
it
together
it
just
comes
apart
before
can
even
attach
anything
into
the
clamp
not
sure
if
got
defective
unit
but
other
people
seem
to
not
have
this
issue
one
thing
that
noticed
about
this
that
isn't
advertised
when
you
fold
this
down,
it
covers
your
home
button
so
it's
impossible
to
accidently
press
it
when
it's
away
and
in
your
bag
didn't
order
this
it
was
my
son
but
when
it
came
he
was
not
happy
was
going
to
send
it
back,
but
the
baby
got
to
it
faster
them
me
really
great
phone
mount
for
my
ps0
controller
it
grips
well
and
doesn
move
around
at
alli
ve
been
using
it
as
well
to
play
apple
arcade
and
emulators
with
my
iphone
pro
and
it
has
worked
really
welldefinitely
must
buy
if
you
are
looking
for
mount
get
tired
of
holding
my
phone
and
controller
around
while
playing
an
emulator,
this
was
the
perfect
buy
this
thing
was
little
difficult
to
use,
but
eventually
understood
the
clamp
went
in
an
over
under
pattern
and
if
you
have
phone
with
type
c,
all
you
have
to
do
is
try
pressing
the
share
and
ps
button
at
the
same
time
to
activate
bluetooth
on
the
ps0
controller
happy
gaming
great
for
holding
phone
while
you
play
keeps
my
hands
from
cramping
up
or
getting
tired
also
helps
me
from
tilting
my
head
down
so
can
sit
straight
and
not
hurt
my
back
neck
and
shoulders
this
works
have
iphone0max
and
it
holds
very
well
am
happy
with
my
purchase
also
comes
with
phone
stand,
so
when
facetime
or
wanna
play
instead
of
putting
the
phone
on
the
clip
holder,
use
the
little
stand
and
works
awesome
it's
pain
to
get
on
but
once
you
do
its
solid
didn't
want
to
go
through
that
process
again
so
just
left
the
damn
thing
on
lol
over
all
it's
worth
the
money
to
me
good
time
consumer
for
my
work
breaks
the
clamp
cracked
my
screen
protector
on
my
phone;
the
samsung
note
ultra
0g
the
cord
in
the
picture
misleads
you
to
believe
the
cord
included
is
micro
usb
to
micro
usb
but
is
actually
micro
usb
to
micro
usb
which
was
disappointing
as
the
description
does
not
match
the
image
and
my
phone
uses
the
latter
would
return
said
item
but
seems
too
much
hassle
for
its
price
to
sum
it
up,
it
awesome
once
the
phone
is
on
it
stays
on
have
an
iphone
and
can
bluetooth
to
the
ps0
controller
and
don
need
cords
just
have
for
any
gamer
oh
also
fits
the
phone
with
my
outterbox
case
on
it
definitely
worth
the
money
was
looking
for
something
like
this
and
was
debating
about
it
but
after
reading
other
reviews
had
to
get
it
and
see
if
it
was
worth
it
and
so
it
was
holds
my
phone
great
and
the
little
phone
stand
works
even
better
for
me
clamp
holds
my
lg
stylo
does
not
loosen
when
move
the
controller
around
it's
snug
tight
fit
on
the
ps0
controller
must
have
if
you
like
to
play
games
on
your
phone
via
bluetooth
controller
connected
was
broken
upon
arrival
the
point
where
it
is
supposed
to
attach
to
itself
on
the
audio
jack
end
of
the
controller
was
broken
and
not
in
the
box
only
took
star
from
sturdiness
because
it
feels
easily
breakable,
but
it
hasn't
broken
yet
days
ini
had
to
trouble
for
moment
figuring
out
how
to
latch
the
mount
onto
the
controller
but
once
got
that
it
has
worked
perfect
to
play
kotor
on
my
phone
after
watching
previous
purchaser's
video
saw
how
it
is
supposed
to
click
it
take
little
effort
to
get
it
to
snap
into
place
properly
as
didnt
want
to
snap
it
once
it
was
secured
it
is
awesome,
fits
my
s0+
little
low
key
salty
that
the
stupid
little
pice
of
plastic
that
keeps
the
thing
shut
was
already
broken
but
found
stupid
easy
solution
just
melted
hit
glue
stick
with
lighter
and
it
is
holding
good
now
but
idgaf
im
just
happy
to
not
have
to
play
cod
like
bad
ass
now
comes
with
micro
to
micro
usb
cable
would
be
fine
if
it
was
every
phone
now
has
usb
type
connector
it
does
not
stay
clipped
and
the
power
cable
is
an
inch
to
short
so
its
not
really
used
ever
it
is
kind
of
cheaply
made
was
expecting
it
to
be
little
more
bang
for
the
buck
but
it
works
fine
guess
got
what
expected
but
should
have
went
ahead
and
got
cheaper
one
so
far
best
product
ve
had
fits
perfectly
when
properly
used
you
have
to
make
sure
it
in
place,
ones
you
figure
it
out,
it
not
going
anywhere
can
hold
my
iphone
which
is
very
heavy
this
fits
really
well
was
initially
nervous
about
connecting
to
ends
because
thought
was
going
to
break
it
but
once
did
,
it
was
securely
fastened
this
worked
great
bought
different
brands
and
this
one
was
way
better,
thicker
plastic,
phone
angles
are
great,
solid
fit
highly
recommend
this
work
better
than
thought
for
the
price
it
is
great
the
only
negative
would
say
is
you
can
use
it
with
pop
socket
little
tricky
to
lock
into
place
but
once
you
figure
it
out
it's
pretty
easy
to
use
actually
easier
to
put
on
than
other
styles
all
necessary
button
and
holes
are
accessible
the
extra
stand
come
in
handy
and
is
so
slim
it
makes
it
easy
to
carry
around
the
mount
for
the
controller
fine
but
kinda
really
hard
to
clip
on
to
the
controller
and
feels
like
it
might
break
but
it
works
great
and
will
hold
an
iphone
0plus
with
case
which
is
awesome
only
real
complaint
is
that
the
stand
isn't
put
together
like
it
was
supposed
to
or
didn't
even
at
least
include
the
hardware
to
do
so
works
just
as
expected,
balances
nicely
with
my
older
iphone
plus
using
microusb
to
lightening
adapter
can
even
get
wired
connection
to
my
iphone
adapter

tps://smileamazoncom/dp/b0qi0gq/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_glc_fabc_zn0fb0z0e0gv_
encoding=utf0&psc=0
can
get
this
to
stay
on
my
ps0
control
will
return
it
back
and
hope
to
get
good
one
people
that
say
it
doesn
even
clip
together
just
aren
pushing
hard
enough
had
trouble
at
first
to
but
once
realized
how
to
do
it,
it
easy
it
tight
fit
so
it
really
sturdy
it
all
seems
really
solid
so
far
the
plastic
that
clips
to
the
controller
is
little
thin
but
as
long
as
your
not
bending
it
any
way
it
shouldn
it
fine
took
minute
to
get
it
on
because
was
afraid
to
be
too
forceful
once
it's
on
it
is
sturdy
as
can
be
it's
good,
but
super
flimsy
when
trying
to
attach
to
the
controller
the
latch
part
is
so
thin
that
it
breaks
had
mine
for
about
week
and
it's
already
broken
exactly
what
was
looking
for
perfect
fit
for
both
controller
and
phone
definitely
works
perfect
for
me
to
play
my
call
of
duty
mobile
so
many
of
you
may
be
experiencing
the
same
issue
had
when
first
ordered
the
mount
which
is
the
mount
not
closing
and
staying
attached
to
the
controller
what
you
need
to
do
is,
grab
the
bottom
clamp
and
forcefully
pull
it
over
the
to
clamp
so
it
can
close
now
it
may
feel
like
it
going
to
break
at
first
but
trust
me
it
wont
hopefully
this
helps
in
,
high
quality
products
,
easy
to
use
and
give
you
best
performance
,
like
it
and
recommend
it
the
phone
stand
was
major
plus,
but
the
one
that
hooked
up
to
the
controller
is
sturdy
and
so
far
my
bf
hasn
broken
it
out
of
anger
yet
which
is
good
feels
cheap
but
does
what
it
states
there
are
even
cheaper
options
out
there
for
the
same
product
perfect
fit
for
standard
and
oversized
phones
just
make
sure
you
properly
latch
the
bottom
clip
to
the
top
clip
that
lays
on
the
face
of
your
controller
works
great
for
my
iphone
+
ps0
controller
combo
the
only
thing
is
have
mophie
charging
case
and
sometimes
my
phone
falls
off
the
mount
due
to
the
weight
without
the
case
it
great
overall
good
buy
product
works
as
stated
it
is
very
sturdy
an
compliments
my
clear
dualshock
well
would
but
again
using
note
plus
my
husband
constantly
plays
on
his
ps0
or
his
phone
thought
this
would
be
perfect
for
him
was
right
he
plays
cod
on
it
0/0
the
sturdiness
of
the
phone
and
holder
are
great
it
helps
him
be
"all
in"
to
his
gaming
it
sturdy
enough
and
definitely
worth
the
price
good
product
only
one
major
issue
with
it,
it
will
not
hold
the
weight
of
an
cr
very
well
make
sure
to
tighten
the
joints
completely
so
it
holds
up
other
than
that
very
good
does
what
it
says
very
well
great
for
the
price
im
on
s0
ultra
works
as
stated
stays
on
the
controller
with
rugged
use
both
of
my
sons
thought
they
were
little
generic
didn't
work
the
first
time
company
followed
up
with
instruction
and
helped
out
already
broken
and
was
very
mindful
of
the
plastic
clasp
what
waste
of
money
works
exactly
as
described
no
problem
so
far
initialy
the
holder
was
hard
to
put
on
the
controller,
but
it
feels
like
it
won't
fall
off
so
it
feels
secure
this
is
not
the
controller
holder
for
you
the
clamp
does
not
lock
in
place,
so
the
moment
you
place
your
phone,
it
is
going
to
fall
off
this
is
definitely
poorly
made
product
im
amazed
at
this
product
it
makes
my
gaming
experience
better
especially
if
want
to
move
arround
while
playing
or
someone
else
is
using
my
tv
not
work
if
you
have
heavy
phone
like
note
plus
in
my
case
it
is
the
one
have
and
you
want
this
product
to
play
fps
do
not
recommend
it
because
it
makes
the
controller
weigh
lot
and
makes
it
difficult
for
you
to
play
and
would
worsen
the
experience
of
the
game
:v
it's
little
hard
to
get
clipped
on
controller
but
holds
pretty
well
probably
could
use
little
rethinking
on
how
it
clips
on
to
controller
but
otherwise
good
product
now,
will
certainly
be
the
best
mobile
gamer,
right
exactly
what
wanted
it
works
perfectly
my
only
gripe
is
that
had
to
buy
separate
cord
because
have
galaxy
s0
with
usbc
it
would
be
nice
if
it
had
an
option
to
come
with
that
cord
instead
great
good
really
good,
recommend
it
it's
perfect
for
the
price
,
it
allows
your
phone
to
be
attached
with
your
controller
plus
it
comes
with
phone
stand
and
love
it
use
it
on
daily
basis
they're
well
worth
your
money
works
great
gonna
get
for
my
other
controller
sturdy
and
works
well,
cable
included
is
micro
usb
to
micro
usb
received
it
jan
0th
and
it
broke
last
night
it's
pretty
cheap
plastic
but
it
does
the
job
just
don't
think
it's
worth
the
money
as
you
can
see
in
the
pictures
the
part
where
it
clips
together
snapped
do
have
to
say,
the
small
phone
stand
it's
actually
pretty
useful
and
nice
extra
works
great
with
ps0
controller
well
designed,
easily
fit
my
ps0
controller
and
holds
my
iphone
with
or
without
it's
otterbox
case
perfectly
probably
the
best
mount
clip
you
can
find
very
sturdy
and
you
can
use
your
controller
for
your
regular
system
games
how
it
was
built
dont
believe
it
is
intended
for
even0
grams
of
weight
which
is
light
since
any
thing
will
make
it
fall
apart
very
flimsy,
cheaply
built
and
honestly
waste
of
your
time
and
money
like
that
can
use
it
wherever
go
and
it
doesn
give
my
husband
any
problems
when
playing
on
his
phone
neat,
and
does
the
job
works
with
iphone
xs
bought
this
to
fly
my
dji
tello
using
ps0
controller
it
has
made
flying
the
drone
much
easier
as
can
have
my
phone
and
the
controller
all
in
once
place
it
definitely
makes
the
fpv
flying
much
better
and
more
enjoyable
experience
excelente
snaps
on
tight
and
secure
however,
feels
as
if
snap
on
piece
could
break
if
taken
on
and
off
slot
otherwise
it
feels
great
and
seems
very
secure
was
skeptical
about
purchasing
this
item
but
am
glad
ended
up
buying
it
it
turned
out
to
be
really
good
product
it
crazy
how
$0
item
can
bring
you
just
joy
:
great
value
increase
my
gaming
experience
thank
you
so
much
cool
it's
decent
product
for
the
cost
my
only
complaint
is
that
it
ships
with
micro
usb
to
micro
usb
cable
0%
of
phones
these
days
use
usb
for
android
if
this
was
micro
usb
to
usb
c,
it'd
would
be
perfect
feels
solid
not
cheap
holds
my
note
ultra
0g
no
issues
just
wish
it
came
with
usb
to
micro
usb
as
choice
this
is
perfect
fits
amazingly
and
is
the
best
add
on
for
my
controller
can
play
where
ever
want
now
fits
perfect
and
holds
the
phoeen
perfectly
it
already
cracked
where
the
lever
meets
the
other
side
to
clamp
on
the
clamping
mechanism
needs
to
be
more
robust
for
constantly
removal
of
product
dose
the
job
well
broke
on
second
day
it
not
for
iphone
have
iphone
and
the
wire
is
not
compatible
with
it
you
have
to
chanchi
the

of
your
product

my
money

often
disappointed
it

everything
about

expectations
buy
it
peeps
the
clamp
its
self
holds
onto
the
controller
until
you
add
the
phone
since
there
is
no
latch
due
to
the
weight
of
the
phone

pretty
neat
design
very
disappointed

not
fit
my
sons
iphone
it
came
with
an
android
cord
reviews
stated
it
was
for
iphone
and
android
bought
this
and
didn
even
need
it
i'm
very
upset
bought
of
these
for
my
son's
for
christmas
and
it
was
only
the
clip
it
didn't
come
with
all
of
the
pieces
the
product
does
not
support
the
weight
of
the
phone
whatsoever
flimsy,
does
not
clip
on
the
ps0
controller
properly,
will
be
returning
cheap
but
is
exactly
what
needed
to
up
my
xcloud/geforcenow
experience
with
the
ps0
remote
works
great,
plenty
sturdy
exactly
what
neededgot
good
laugh
from
the
broken
english
on
the
package
:p
great
product,
mainly
for
for
son
to
use
to
play
on
spare
phone
can
confirm
it
works
with
plus
sized
phones
especially
iphones
completely
wireless
thanks
to
ios
needs
better
instructions
on
how
to
put
the
thing
on
but
you
ll
get
it
after
minute
did
it
job
at
very
low
price
good
product
kinda
hard
to
set
up
at
first
feels
like
its
gonna
break
but
once
you
do
it
the
first
time
it
gets
easier
little
tough
to
get
on
at
first
but
once
on
works
greatgood
product
for
the
price
works
great
super
convenient,
totally
recommend
this
add
on
if
you
play
alot
of
mobile
games
good
quality
bit
flimsy
but
definitely
holds
the
phone
decently
to
be
able
to
play
the
mount
doesn't
clamp
on
the
controller
this
product
does
not
work
fits
great
on
an
iphone
with
lifeproof
case
on
it
bought
as
gift
m,
recipient
was
very
happy
with
it
works
like
charm
wish
the
tightening
knobs
were
sturdy
other
than
that
it
good
buy
perfect
for
playing
fortnite
on
phone
very
sturdy
and
comes
with
stand
didn
like
that
it
doesn
clip
on,
the
weight
of
the
phone
is
too
much,
phone
will
fall
as
it
doesn
clip
on,
basically
just
wraps
around
the
control
love
it
it
works
perfect
the
clip
doesnt
lock,
you
either
gonna
drio
your
phone
or
your
ps
remote,
total
waste
of
money
it
can
be
difficult
to
attach
the
clasp
at
first,
but
really,
great
product
it
didn
close
and
wouldn
hold
phone
plus
it
was
missing
the
stand
for
the
phone
playstation
remote
do
not
buy
doesn
hold
it
dose
hold
the
cellphone
like
it
showing
in
the
picture
not
recommended
waist
of
money
super
sturdy
and
kinda
hard
to
put
on
but
the
lip
near
the
play
station
button
goes
under
the
gap
near
the
head
phone
jack
can
now
play
games
on
my
phone
using
my
controller
this
is
an
awesome
product
total
pain
to
clip
but
seems
to
work
ok
once
clipped

it
everywhere

easy
to
use

my
gaming
experience

nice
very

it
dosen't
work
it
won't
clamp
to
the
controller
love
it
doesn
stay
on
easy
to
use
love
it
great
control
bought
this
based
on
it
being
"amazon's"
choice
as
well
as
some
other
reviews
saying
it
was
good
for
what
it
is
the
only
upside
to
this
order
was
that
received
it
in
days,
being
in
hawaii,
thats
unheard
of
immediately
opening
the
package,
noticed
right
away
that
the
clip
was
not
sturdy
at
all
literally
fell
off
the
controller
and
just
placed
the
controller
down
no
weight
and
the
clip
comes
off
the
clip
doesnt
even
clip
to
anythingi
guess
you
get
what
you
pay
for
this
chinese
crap,
literally
is
chinese
crap
cheaply
made,
cheap
feel,
cheap
look
and
even
the
writing
on
the
box
makes
you
want
to
laugh
because
of
google
translates
translation
no
installation
instructions
either,
not
that
it's
needed
or
anythingi
submitted
refund
request
through
amazon
although
it's
free,
still
wasted
money
by
having
to
use
about
$0
worth
of
tape
to
reseal
the
boxdo
yourself
favor,
don't
buy
this
save
yourself
the
hassle
and
buy
another
one
or
suck
it
up
and
use
the
phone
controls
or
your
ps0
controller
without
the
phone
mount
lol,
what
waste
of
time,
effort
and
money
this
thing
is
piece
of
crap
that
does
not
work
it
will
not
hold
more
than
the
tiniest
bit
of
weight,
making
this
product
utterly
useless
the
part
of
the
mount
that
wraps
around
the
controller
is
made
from
flimsy
plastic,
and
has
weak
hinge
the
clip
that
holds
the
phone
feels
good
it
holds
my
lg
v0
in
it's
otterbox
case
we'll
it
ships
with
micro
usb
to
micro
usb
cable
had
to
order
usb
toicro
usb
cable
to
ha
it
work
the
cable
has
the
phone
as
the
host
side
of
the
otg
the
ds0
will
connect
via
bluetooth
but
the
remote
play
app
does
not
use
it
there
isn't
single
durable
part
to
this
thing
the
two
ends
that
clamp
over
the
controller
if
that's
what
you
can
even
call
it
were
not
aligned
and
would
not
stay
closed
completely
useless
piece
of
plastic
realistically
and
from
an
aesthetic
pov,
you're
better
off
buying
separate
compact
stand
or
case
with
builtin
one
just
for
the
phone
and
keeping
the
controller
separate
imagine
that
lot
of
these
individuals
that
reviewed
that
the
"case
doesnt
work"
did
not
know
how
to
install
the
clip
it
took
me
good
minutes
to
figure
it
out
and
some
irritation
but
apparently
the
bottom
edge
of
the
plastic
shell
has
to
latch
over
the
risen
lip
of
the
top
half
of
the
shell
it
is
held
in
place
by
tension
and
does
require
some
force
to
lock
in
place
im
not
taking
my
ps0
controller
out
of
it,
because
feel
if
repeatedly
take
off
and
install
this
case,
the
plastic
will
splinter
or
break
rendering
the
mount
unusable
could
see
this
thing
breaking
pretty
quickly
in
the
hands
of
child/adolescent
as
it
does
feel
relatively
cheap
care
must
be
taken
with
itthe
phone
mount
itself
is
pretty
good,
holds
my
xs
horizontally
just
fine,
played
asphalt
on
ios
for
about
three
hours
with
no
issues
if
the
phone
starts
to
sink
out
of
position,
you
can
twist
the
side
knob
to
apply
more
compression
and
keep
the
mount
held
in
place
this
would
be
fine
product
if
it
actually
clipped
closed
but
somehow
it
doesn't
literally
can't
even
use
this
for
more
than
seconds
without
my
phone
just
falls
off
and
the
clip
coming
apart
thought
maybe
had
missing
piece
or
something,
but
then
read
the
bad
reviews
are
all
for
the
same
reason
