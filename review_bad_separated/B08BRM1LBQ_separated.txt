this
is
the
first
robot
vacuum
have
ever
owned
so
have
nothing
to
compare
this
to
other
than
my
normal
manual
vacuum
cleanerthe
kids
and
were
really
excited
to
finally
have
an
easier
way
to
vacuum
have
kids,
dogs,
and
cats
so
we
vacuum
twice
day
usually
it
gets
really
mundane
and
hassle
to
bring
the
vaccuum
out
morning
and
eveningi've
had
this
vacuum
for
aboit
days
now
and
haven't
had
to
use
the
manual
vacuum
cleaner
at
alltheir
are
side
brushes
to
help
get
the
stuff
on
the
edges
the
suction
on
max
is
just
as
good
as
manual
vacuumi
thought
it
was
pretty
great
that
it
came
with
extra
side
brushes
and
extra
filtersyou
can
schedule
cleaning
while
you're
asleep
and
wake
up
to
perfectly
clean
room
it's
so
refreshingthe
remote
it
pretty
cool
too
though
we
really
don't
use
it
that
often
the
kids
thinks
it's
cool
that
you
can
use
the
remote
to
control
the
vacuum
like
remote
control
car
thoughover
all
this
has
been
welcomed
addition
to
our
busy
house

did
lot
of
research
before
buying
robot
vacuum
went
with
the
bagotte
for
few
reasons:
cleaning
power,
quietness,
and
modern
designcleaning
power:
have
used
it
twice
this
week
it
picks
up
so
much
dust
and
hair
from
my
wood
floor
we
do
full
vacuum
every
week
with
my
dyson,
so
think
of
the
robot
vacuum
as
supplemental
vacuum
was
shocked
at
how
much
was
in
the
dustbin
after
it's
auto
mode
cleaning
it
also
gets
ton
of
dust
in
the
little
dust
filterquietness:
my
kids
are
studying
from
home
these
days,
and
this
vacuum
is
quiet
enough
that
don't
even
turn
it
off
during
their
zoom
classes
this
might
be
the
thing
am
most
impressed
withmodern
design:
love
this
design
and
size
it
definitely
looks
modern
and
cool,
and
it
fits
under
almost
all
our
furnitures

my
dog
sheds
lot
and
it
was
becoming
tedious
vacuuming
the
laminate
flooring
every
day
now,
this
vacuum
does
the
job
for
me
it
has
very
powerful
suction
and
doesn't
miss
thing
every
hair
gets
sucked
from
the
floor
the
vacuum
has
no
trouble
maneuvering
over
area
rugs
it
does
bump
into
furniture,
but
that's
to
be
expected
however,
it
smartly
edges
the
furniture,
making
sure
to
catch
every
nook
and
cranny
the
vacuum
rotated
around
my
table
and
all
four
chairs,
traveling
to
the
edge
of
each
before
turning
down
each
side
that's
20
sides
it
even
managed
to
sweep
my
entire
first
floor
900
square
feet
before
returning
to
its
home
station
hours
without
returning
for
chargewith
the
ability
to
set
it
to
run
whenever
you
want,
i've
been
able
to
set
it
to
run
every
night
after
go
to
bed
it's
great
and
effortless
got
this
recently
and
must
say
we
are
quite
impressed
with
this
robo
vacuumsome
of
the
things
we
like
about
this
very
thin
at
around
28
inches
compared
to
the
35
inches
for
comparable
brandcomes
with
brushes,
remote,
batteries,
cleaning
brush
and
other
stuff
like
charging
adaptorthe
glossy
finish
is
so
catchy
my
friends
whoever
have
seen
this
are
very
impressed
with
the
eye
catching
looks
of
this
vacuum
cleanermy
sofa
is
quite
low
and
due
to
its
low
height,
the
vacuum
cleaner
was
able
to
go
under
and
catch
durt
quite
easilyalso
that
the
adaptor
shows
an
input
of
100240
which
could
be
useful
to
some
peoplei
get
around
90100
mins
of
battery
life
probably
the
battery
could
have
been
bit
better
but
then
again
this
so
thin
to
fit
bigger
battery
also,
the
vacuum
cleaner
finds
the
docking
station
automatically
so
should
not
be
an
issuewe
were
intially
sceptical
about
this
but
it
turned
out
to
be
good

some
good

love
that
can
sit
on
the
couch
watching
television
shows
while
using
the
little
remote
to
make
this
vacuum
clean
for
me
what
wonderful
times
we
live
in,
isn
iti
have
had
similar
vacuumed
in
this
before
but
this
one
is
so
much
nicer
this
one
sucks
up
all
the
mess
the
first
time
other
ones
have
to
go
over
the
mess
few
times
before
it
gets
at
all
this
one
has
excellent
inhaleit
can
even
put
it
self
right
back
on
it
charging
port
when
it
done
doing
the
job
never
find
myself
wanting
to
use
it
but
having
it
be
powerless
it
always
fully
charged
and
ready
to
goyou
can
barely
hear
it
you
can
definitely
hear
it,
it
not
silence
by
any
means,
but
it
relatively
quiet
for
such
advice
don
even
have
to
turn
the
television
up
any
louder
when
it
comes
into
the
roomwould
buy
this
brand
again
most
definitely
this
steam
iron
for
clothes
works
well
it
heats
up
fast,
within
about
30
seconds
the
bottom
steel
plate
glides
smoothly
and
doesn't
scald
the
clothes
am
ironing
it
also
has
temperature
dial
so
that
can
different
types
of
materials
the
iron
is
also
steam
iron,
which
use
frequently,
that
has
self
cleaning
feature
it
automatically
shuts
off
after
placing
it
upright
for
minutes
so
it
give
me
security
in
knowing
that
it
will
auto
power
off
have
always
preferred
"small"
irons
have
small
hands
and
hate
heavy
irons
as
feel
they
make
ironing
even
more
work
than
they
have
to
be
could
not
find
small
iron
when
mine
finally
died,
so
decided
to
try
this
one
love
it
it
is
lightweight,
works
great,
does
fantastic
job
don't
even
have
to
use
starch
love
all
the
features
commented
on
day
that
the
robot
didn't
work
would
push
the
blue
button
to
start
cleaning
and
it
beeped
and
changed
from
blue
to
pink
to
red
submitted
return
without
reordering
the
company
reached
out
to
me
and
are
sending
replacement
before
send
this
one
back
so
it
is
to
arrive
in
few
days
so
will
update
the
review
after
receive
the
new
robotupdate:7/26/2020
received
the
new
robot
programmed
it
to
run
every
day
at
9:00am
it
ran
at
1:00am
the
company
reached
out
to
me
to
show
me
how
to
reprogram
the
robot
first,
what
you
need
to
know,
you
need
to
program
the
current
time
first
before
you
program
the
time
to
run
the
robot
and
to
stop
the
current
program,
hold
down
on
the
timer
button
for
second
until
the
robot
beeps
twice
this
clears
the
current
saved
time
now
you
can
program
the
time
you
want
it
to
run
also,
make
sure
you
are
near
the
robot
to
make
this
work
it
will
not
set
if
you
are
in
different
room
than
the
robot
like
the
dirt
trap
on
this
robot
it
is
solid
and
holds
the
dirt
in
the
container
am
very
happy
to
change
my
review
from
star
to
stars
for
both
the
robot
and
customer
service
almost
want
to
keep
it
at
star
so
that
it
gets
read
and
doesn't
get
lost
in
all
the
other
stars
very
happy
with
my
purchaseupdate:

this
robot
vacuum
works
like
dream
and
has
greatly
simplified
the
sometimes
annoying
task
of
housekeeping
everything
can
be
controlled
or
preset
via
remote
control,
allowing
an
incredible
amount
of
flexibility
for
example,
can
set
the
vacuum
to
do
its
rounds
during
time
when
am
out
of
the
house
and
by
pressing
the
home
button
or
when
the
battery
is
low,
as
demonstrated
by
the
video
above,
the
device
always
finds
its
own
way
back
to
the
charging
port
does
what
steam
iron
should
do
so
far
the
steam
control
is
working
better
than
other
iron
we
ve
had
precise
control
all
the
time
when
the
first
time
hold
this
steamer,
feel
little
bit
heavy
but,
when
check
the
instruction,
it
stated
that
is
made
by
iron
so,
having
weight
is
very
reasonable
the
most
thing
care
about
is
the
quality
of
steaming
my
business
shirt
am
very
surprising
that
is
fast
steaming
tool
turn
on
the
steamer
for
an
about
40s,
the
steamer
is
getting
hot
enought
also,
like
the
function
of
sparking
i,
as
new
user,
don
know
how
to
control
the
heat
i,
somehow,
worried
that
if
over
steam
my
white
shirt,
there
might
at
risk
to
get
burn
when
sparking
the
water
on
the
cloth,
it
is
not
only
help
to
steam
my
shirt
nicely,
but
it
also
make
my
shirt
lower
the
temperature
think
this
is
good
for
new
user
who
don
feel
comfortable
to
steaming
clothes
overall,
rate
starts
as
think
that
this
quality
is
worth
received
damaged
iron
outer
box
fine,
but
inner
box
damaged;
missing
warranty
card;
iron
damaged
was
this
returned
before
plus
when
handled
the
iron
it
felt
heavy
and
the
shape
of
the
iron
&
handle
felt
really
uncomfortable
it
also
leaked
water
returned
it
and
it
took
them
week
to
process
refund
aggravating
and
waste
of
time
i'm
70
year
old
guy
who
hates
house
work
don't
like
vacuuming
at
alla
friend
recommended
robotic
vacuum,so
did
some
research
and
ordered
the
bg600it
came
yesterday
and
charged
it
up
and
let
it
looseit
was
fun
watching
it
bounce
around
the
house
bumping
into
everything
thought
it
got
lost
under
my
bed,but
when
it
came
out
sent
it
back
to
charging
cradle
and
emptied
the
waste
bin
was
surprised
to
see
how
much
dirt
it
picked
up
imagine
most
was
from
under
the
bedi
look
foward
to
letting
it
go
until
battery
runs
low
and
seeing
it
return
to
charging
base
by
itselfthis
appears
very
well
made
and
reccomend
it
as
my
first
impression

robotic
vacuum
cleaner
is
great
addition
to
regular
vacuum
cleaner
if
you
like
to
maintain
your
home
neat
and
don
feel
like
taking
out
your
heavy
duty
vacuum
cleaner
each
timei
have
long
dark
hair
that
constantly
falls
out
when
it
does,
it
looks
very
messy
and
visible
on
my
hard
wood
floor
the
regular
vacuum
cleaner
use
it
maybe
once
every
two
weeks
and
in
between
this
robotic
vacuum
does
the
job
by
cleaning
up
hair
and
dirt
around
visible
areas
it
keep
my
house
clean
and
tidy
when
guests
are
coming
over
this
vacuum
definitely
saves
me
time
since
leave
it
running
while
cooking,
doing
laundry
and
other
house
chores
it
quiet
so
can
even
leave
it
on
running
while
watching
tv
price
is
much
more
affordable
than
other
robotic
vacuums
so
didn
feel
guilty
purchasing
this
on
top
of
my
regular
vacuum
ownwhat
appreciate
most
about
this
vacuum
is
that
it
thin
design
that
enables
cleaning
of
hard
to
reach
places
it
cleaned
the
nasty
dust
piled
up
under
my
bed
and
living
room
sofa
this
feature
alone
is
pricelessthere
virtually
no
assembly
required
other
than
attaching
the
side
brushes
the
design
looks
modern
and
sleek
so
looks
cool
displayed
with
the
remote
control
holder
and
charging
station
like
using
the
remote
control
to
direct
the
vacuum
where
to
go
as
my
living
room
is
bit
of
maze
also,
the
fact
that
the
vacuum
finds
its
way
to
recharge
when
you
press
button
is
cool
featurethe
only
thing
to
watch
out
for
is
that
if
you
have
carpet
with
long
threads,
the
side
brushes
might
get
caught
on
the
threads
so
be
awarethis
vacuum
became
must
have
from
nice
to
have
now
absolutely
need
it
to
clean
areas
cannot
reach
using
traditional
vacuum
cleaners
it
saves
me
tremendous
amount
of
time
and
energy
am
very
happy
to
keep
house
neat
with
very
little
effort

amazed
at
how
efficient
it
is
my
parents
were
opposed
to
our
purchase
at
the
beginning,
but
now
they
can't
wait
to
recommend
it
to
their
relatives
and
friends
it
always
does
good
job
of
clearing
out
corners
that
we
don't
normally
notice,
and
dust
that
we
can't
see
it
also
cleans
areas
that
aren't
usually
easy
to
clean,
such
as
under
bed
or
sofa
when
we
put
it
at
the
top
of
the
stairs,
it
can
sense
danger
and
move
back
we
set
it
to
automatically
clean
up
every
morning
now
it
is
an
indispensable
part
of
our
family,
we
all
love
it
am
not
very
diligent
person
when
it
comes
to
sweeping
so
robot
vacuum
is
pretty
much
requirement
for
me
if
there
is
any
way
to
get
my
floors
cleaned
got
this
for
that
purpose
first
thing
noticed
is
the
relative
low
sound
it
produces
def
can
have
this
on
while
watching
tv
it
gets
around
my
home
floor
very
well
and
fits
under
my
couch
and
my
coffee
table
that
is
nice
bonus
as
was
concerned
it
might
be
too
high
it
does
compress
itself
somewhat
when
getting
to
those
areas
so
there
is
bit
of
givethis
is
definitely
one
of
the
better
lower
entry
level
robotic
vacuums
great
for
hardwood
floors
and
light
carpets
we
have
household
members
that
have
long
hair
and
did
notice
that
they
do
get
collected
into
the
roller
areas
it
comes
with
tool
to
help
remove
those
hairs,
we
make
sure
to
clean
those
out
after
each
cleaningoverall
very
pleased
with
the
vacuum
big
change
in
the
house
with
it
vs
without
it

this
is
45
star
reviewfirst
of
all,
let
talk
about
the
goods;it
does
meets
my
expectations,
love
it
how
you
can
schedule
cleaning
time
for
each
day,
it
really
make
my
wife
day
lot
easier
it
can
easily
reach
to
the
areas
that
is
hard
for
our
humans,
such
like
the
areas
under
the
sofa,
beds
etc
and
it
does
cleaning
well,
it
vacuums
the
dust
and
hairs
completely
form
the
area
that
is
put
on
duty,
we
can
not
clean
the
same
level
as
this
robot
did
unless
we
put
lots
of
effort
in
it,
but
why
let
the
robot
do
work,
how
easy
is
thatnow
let
talk
about
why
this
review
is
45
instead
star
review
the
only
down
side
about
this
product
is
the
noise
level,
now
it
is
not
ridiculously
loud
but
it
is
loud
enough
that
can
bring
my
attention
to
it
wish
it
can
be
more
silence,
and
that
the
one
of
reason
why
we
scheduled
the
cleaning
time
to
pm
instead
of
12am
when
everyone
is
asleep
and
not
using
the
living
room
completely
yes
we
set
the
charging
station
in
our
living
room
if
the
manufacturer
can
reduce
the
noise
level
then
think
this
product
can
be
perfect
now
would
recommend
this
product
sure
it
is
good
purchase
over
all,
we
are
satisfied
so
it's
little
louder
than
box
fanbut
still
heck
of
lot
quieter
than
normal
vaccum
still
able
to
watch
tv
with
it
goin,
just
have
to
turn
the
volume
up
slightly
don't
really
use
the
remote
sometimes
it
has
issues
getting
back
to
the
dock
so
help
it
there
keep
in
mind
this
is
my
first
rumbaesque
vaccum
have
about
850sq
ft
apt,
and
it
can
clean
most
if
it
on
one
charge
and
emptying
it
once
half
way
through
seems
to
wander
bit,
so
usually
isolate
it
in
sectionslike
close
it
off
in
the
bedroom/bathroom/kitchen/livingroom
it's
strong
enough
to
eat
chords
so
make
sure
charging
cables
are
up
off
the
ground
we
lovingly
call
ours
mr
roboto,
and
he
surprised
me
once
coming
out
of
the
bathroom
with
half
eaten
pair
of
my
girfriend's
panties
your

does

video
this
is
great
alternative
to
the
more
expensive
brands
the
suction
on
this
robot
is
surprisingly
strong
it's
able
to
pull
dog
hair
out
of
deep
carpet
the
selfguided
mode
is
very
smart
and
it
can
easily
maneuver
around
hardwood
floor,
carpet,
tile,
and
even
thresholds
the
brushes
pick
debris
extremely
well,
but
don't
scratch
up
the
floor
with
the
manual
mode
on
the
remote,
you
can
guide
the
bot
where
you
want
with
ease
there
are
even
spot
clean
options
to
really
focus
on
trouble
messes
cleaning
is
super
easy,
and
takes
just
couple
seconds
to
do
whenever
we
leave
the
house,
we
turn
the
bot
on
and
let
it
run
and
come
home
to
clean
house
it'll
automatically
find
it's
own
way
back
to
the
charging
station,
so
it's
like
it
never
left
definitely
worth
every
penny
my
wife
and
bought
this
product
at
~40%
off
to
use
in
the
upper
level
of
our
house
our
upper
level
is
couple
medium
sized
rooms
and
smallish
bedrooms
the
area
is
mostly
open
and
should
be
easy
to
reach
for
robot
of
this
size
however,
the
robot
vacuums
in
completely
random
pattern,
misses
large
areas
in
some
rooms
and
never
even
makes
it
to
others
even
at
40%
off,
this
product
was
complete
waste
of
money
and
will
be
returned
for
competitors
product+
pros
automatically
switches
between
bare
floor
and
carpet
settings
fairly
quiet
picks
up
crumbs
and
dust
well+
cons
no
mapping
functionality
drives
around
at
complete
random
misses
rooms,
large
areas
of
certain
rooms
fails
to
pick
up
anything
other
than
crumb,
just
pushes
/
throws
"larger"
objects
at
random
seems
to
be
trying
to
dent
all
my
wood
furniture
sometimes
it
detects
objects
before
collision,
sometimes
not
bought
it
when
there
was
good
discount
for
amazon
prime
members
gifted
my
robotic
vacuum,
which
had
bought
before,
to
my
mother
actually
this
robot
was
faster,
although
it
was
cheaper
than
before
it
makes
less
noise
while
running
the
traction
force
is
much
higher
ingenuity
this
robot
is
not
affected
much
by
obstacles
on
the
ground
for
example,
my
old
robot
was
standing
in
the
bathroom
due
to
mats
and
was
not
working,
but
now
have
no
problem
with
it
it
picks
up
too
much
dust
and
hair
also
it
can
pick
up
beads
it
is
powerful
when
read
the
explicit
comments
and
there
was
discount,
wanted
to
try
this
product
am
very
glad
with
it
similar
to
all
other
robots
easy
to
clean
the
charging
time
is
also
sufficient
for
long
cleaning
terrible
product
it
can
really
pick
up
anything
so
waste
of
money
dont
buy
it
doesn
pick
up
anything
saw
it
go
over
pet
hair
more
then
four
times
and
not
pick
up
also
hardwood
floors
another
disaster
hate
this
and
not
worth
the
money
no
matter
what
it
costs
in
writing
this
review
learned
could
have
saved
bunch
of
money
but
even
at
reduction
don
waste
your
money
will
never
get
mine
back
please
know
set
this
thing
on
small
areas
and
max
vacuum
and
this
is
what
am
describing
have
used
rowenta
in
the
past
and
that
is
real
workhorse
but
it
is
heavy
and
my
arm
and
shoulder
ache
after
have
done
lot
of
ironing
this
little
decenta
iron
is
lighter
weight
and
did
great
job
got
the
iron
on
may
and
had
no
problems
the
one
day
last
week,
plugged
it
in
to
do
some
ironing
and
it
would
not
heat
up,
nor
did
the
light
come
on
it
was
past
the
return
window,
so
emailed
the
seller
and
told
them
really
liked
the
iron
and
it
had
worked
perfectly,
but
all
of
sudden
wouldn
what
would
they
suggest
for
me
to
try
they
got
back
to
me
immediately,
apologized
and
sent
me
brand
new
iron
didn
expect
that
and
am
so
grateful
and
impressed
with
this
company
and
still
highly
recommend
the
iron
this
is
something
i've
wanted
for
quite
some
time,
but
waited
until
could
afford
it
and
found
the
right
one
am
so
happy
waited
because
this
vacuum
is
awesome
there
are
so
many
features
on
it
that
you
can
use,
such
as
spot
clean
when
you
just
need
one
room
cleaned
or
max
suction
when
you
have
an
area
that
has
lot
of
dirt
it
runs
quiet
max
is
slightly
louder,
but
not
bad,
forget
it
is
there
when
it
needs
to
be
charged
it
goes
back
to
the
base
quickly
and
recharges
love
coming
home
to
clean
floors
every
single
day
this
vacuum
is
awesome
if
you
have
little
kids
too
it
will
clean
up
all
their
crumbs
and
dirt
without
you
having
to
waste
countless
hours
doing
it
you
can
spend
this
time
having
fun
with
them
couldn't
be
happier
customer
and
would
highly
recommend
buying
this
product
this
little
bugger
runs
around
for
hours
and
does
good
job
of
picking
up
our
pets
fur
it
did
better
than
thought
climbing
onto
deep
pile
room
rug
it
sometimes
chooses
not
to
climb
it
but
often
does
and
continues
along
got
this
at
good
price
on
prime
day
and
it
was
good
deal
the
only
feature
that
would
have
liked
that
see
in
other
in
more
expensive
units
is
that
it
doesn't
map
the
rooms
but,
that
is
no
big
deal,
it
just
goes
every
it
can
and
doesn't
seem
to
miss
anything
our
small
dog
lets
it
come
right
up
to
her
and
it
often
turns
but
sometimes
it
bumps
her
and
she
moves
our
bigger
dogs
moves
much
further
away
when
it
approaches
but,
he
is
scared
of
everything
but
another
dog
love
this
thing
i've
had
neatos
evidently
i'm
slow
learner
and
irobot
and
by
far
this
is
the
best
it's
so
quiet
had
doubts
as
to
how
good
job
it
could
possibly
do
it
does
fantastic
job
not
only
does
it
get
the
general
dirt
on
the
floor
up,
it
gets
an
unbelievable
amount
of
dander
i'm
probably
gonna
get
at
least
one
more
for
my
daughter
and
possibly
another
for
our
home
in
arizona
so
don't
have
to
drag
the
first
one
back
and
forthmy
only
quibble
is
that
it
loses
the
side
brushes
that's
ok
i'd
rather
hunt
up
the
brushes
than
push
vacuum
around
every
day
use
it
everyday
and
besides
being
silent,
she
moves
everywhere
without
any
issues
between
my
living
room
and
dining
room,
the
floor
has
divider
which
is
higher
than
the
floor
and
she
hovers
over
very
easily
and
without
any
trouble
at
all
she
doesn
get
stuck,
she
even
vacuums
under
my
couches
and
then
when
she
done
she
goes
back
to
her
charging
station
can
also
send
her
to
the
charging
station
with
the
remote
absolutely
love
it
and
recommend
it
it
was
so
easy
to
set
up
my
10
year
old
granddaughter
did
it
for
me
we
set
it
up
to
start
everyday
at
2:00
,pm
it
covers
the
whole
house,
going
into
each
room
randomly
it
works
for
almost
hours
and
then
automatically
goes
home
to
its
docking
station
if
mop
the
floor
with
swiffer
and
presumably
clean
everything,
this
vacuum
goes
out
and
finds
hidden
lint
every
time
have
to
empty
the
bin
after
uses
love
the
remote
use
it
to
send
the
vacuum
to
specific
spot
where
something
dropped
on
the
floor
and
then
send
him
home
after
bought
one
as
house
warming
present
for
my
son
and
they
love
it
as
well
it
could
have
been
built
with
more
suction
power
but
then
noise
level
would
have
increasedit
could
also
have
been
built
little
bit
taller,
to
provide
larger
dust
bin
but
then
it
would
have
been
unable
to
go
underneath
lowrise
bed
framesthese
were
both
excellent
compromises,
as
far
as
i'm
concerned
can't
comment
about
"battery
life",
but
run
time
between
recharge
cycles
is
quite
good
it
*is*
immune
to
falling
off
of
steps
without
using
the
"blocker"
strip
the
second
"fine"
filter
catches
lot
of
smaller
dust,
and
it's
easy
to
empty/clean
off
both
the
main
dust
bin
and
the
"fine"
filter
just
open
it
and
whack
both
parts
against
the
side
of
big
waste
basketin
very
large
rooms,
it
tends
to
hug
against
the
walls
and
clean
the
room
edges
multiple
times
before
randomly
covering
all
of
the
main
floor
area
it's
tiny
bit
too
unwilling
to
run
in
long,
straight
line
for
long
distance
but
for
normal
rooms,
with
lots
of
furniture,
the
"hitandaimagain"
programming
is
excellentoverall,
just
about
perfect
11/14/20:
really
want
this
iron
but
unfortunately
the
one
received
is
not
working
at
all
bought
it
in
august
and
wished
tried
it
first
when
got
it
to
make
sure
it
working
didn
need
it
until
now
and
came
to
find
out
it
broken
then
inspected
it
closer,
it
looks
like
the
one
got
is
used
most
likely
returned
unfortunately,
it
is
too
late
for
me
to
return
or
exchange
it
w/
an
iron
that
works
so
sadupdate
11/16/20:
my
husband
fixed
the
iron
for
me
so
it
working
now
bringing
the
rating
from
1star
to
3star

you
can't
beat
this
price
for
robotic
vacuum
it's
my
first
robotic
vacuum
so
wanted
to
test
it
out
before
spend
lot
of
money
on
it
have
had
it
for
week
now
so
far
love
it
you
can
program
it
to
automatically
start
at
certain
time
when
battery
runs
low
it
will
find
its
way
back
to
the
charging
station
thought
it's
pretty
sweet
it
does
good
maintenance
job
to
save
time
for
big
cleaning
it's
not
made
for
cleaning
large
mess
because
the
collecting
tray
is
small
and
you'll
have
to
empty
it
frequently
but
for
removing
dust
this
is
perfect
my
house
is
mostly
carpeted,
with
ceramic
flooring
in
the
kitchen
purchased
the
bagotte
robot
vacuum
for
quick,
easy
cleanup
between
vacuumings
hoped
it
would
pick
up
few
crumbs
and
little
dog
hair,
so
wouldn't
have
to
vacuum
so
oftenbut,
this
sleek
and
easytouse
robot
does
much,
much
better
job
than
the
hoover
upright
had
been
using
great
suction
power,
quiet,
and
fun
to
watch
it
scoots
under
the
bed,
around
chair
legs,
across
the
floor,
into
corner
and
along
edges,
and
goes
back
home
to
rechargei
couldn't
be
happier
with
this
purchase
decided
to
try
posting
images
to
my
review
this
time
bought
this
for
my
grandma
so
she
can
vacuum
without
hurting
her
back
have
roomba
and
this
one
is
comparable
assembled
it
for
granny
and
it
was
pretty
easy
mainly,
the
only
thing
you
really
have
to
do
is
snap
the
brushes
on
the
bottom
it
also
has
to
be
charged
over
night
before
use
have
roomba
and
it
bangs
into
everything,
making
lot
of
noise
this
one
has
remote
so
that
not
problem
overall,
grandma
seems
to
like
it
she
especially
likes
the
remote
because
she
can
chase
the
cats
with
the
vacuum
keep
this
in
my
room
to
pick
up
all
the
debris
track
in
from
the
rest
of
the
house
and
it
does
great
job
of
keeping
things
clean
it
isn't
as
noisy
as
you
would
think
and
it
gets
into
whatever
corners
it
can
fit
in
so
it
maximizes
the
area
it
cleans
inthere
are
only
two
issues
have
with
it
the
first
is
that
sometimes
after
it
has
been
cleaning
for
while,
i'll
send
it
back
"home"
but
it
won't
hit
the
charging
base
correctly
it'll
adjust
couple
of
times
but
after
it
doesn't
get
on
it
that
many
time
in
row,
it'll
give
up
and
just
roam
around
the
perimeter
of
the
room
until
manually
set
it
back
down
on
the
charging
base
this
has
happened
twice
but
it's
enough
to
annoy
me
the
second
thing
isn't
necessarily
an
issue,
but
the
button
on
top
to
turn
it
on
that
says
"clean"
is
backlit
and
the
light
is
bright
at
night
when
i'm
trying
to
go
to
sleep
put
painter's
tape
over
it
to
block
out
the
light
and
it's
fine
now,
but
it
is
also
inconvenientoverall,
though,
love
this
little
robot
it
does
great
job
of
cleaning
when
can't
be
bothered
lol

replace
our
old
one
which
was
failing
due
to
old
age
this
new
vacuum
is
great
it
isn
as
loud
as
our
old
one
yet
it
still
cleans
just
as
well,
if
not
better
the
vacuum
has
lot
of
features
like
auto,
spot
cleaning,
edge
cleaning,
single
room
cleaning,

easily
cleaned
both
carpet
and

want
the
vacuum
to
do
with
the

bought
the
bagotte
vacuum
as
second
robot
vacuum
to
clean
my
second
floor
hallway
and
bedrooms
to
my
surprise,
it
is
so
quiet
much
quieter
than
other
brands
that
charge
double
the
price
or
more
can
now
use
it
anytime
during
the
day
without
my
kids
complaining
about
the
noise
it
very
sleek
and
low
profile
and
really
like
the
three
point
cleaning
system
which
covers
large
area
so
cleaning
time
can
be
shorter
it
also
perfect
for
my
house
as
have
dog
and
he
sheds
so
much
this
vacuum
does
good
job
picking
up
his
hair
now

really
leave
the
cleaning
to
this
new
robot
helper
wish

this
vacuum
sooner

have
been
used
this
cleaning
robot
for
few
days,
works
good
so
far
it
has
no
wifi
connection
so
you
need
to
use
remote
controller
the
robot
looks
very
nice
with
shinny
black
as
you
can
hear
from
the
video,
it
doesnt
make
big
noise
and
it
is
pretty
quite
when
it
is
working
this
is
small
robot
so
it
is
work
good
at
apartment
or
used
at
small
area
have
hard
wood
floor
and
can
see
the
difference
after
it
use
given
it
is
less
than
300
dollar,
am
happy
with
it
was
skeptic
because
we
have
dyson
for
carpet
and
had
never
tried
self
vacuum
we
have
dogs
in
the
house
one
terrier
long
hair
breed
and
the
second
short
hair
but
sheds
lot
along
with
grandkids
constantly
running
around
this
little
thing
picks
up
everything
and
more
we
let
it
run
in
the
living
room
when
no
one
is
around
for
about
an
hour
and
the
floor
is
basically
spotless
yes
it
does
have
to
emptied
out
after
every
use
and
filter
with
other
items
are
washable
so
we
do
clean
them
about
once
week
would
rather
do
that
than
have
to
sweep
the
floors
twice
day
it
fits
beautifully
under
couches
and
gets
every
corner
we
can
reach
with
broom
it
also
parks
itself
when
battery
is
dying
or
we
just
send
it
back
when
we
think
it
done
it
job
another
thing
you
have
to
look
out
for
is
wires
make
sure
they
are
picked
up
off
the
floor
highly
recommend
this
and
constantly
send
this
link
to
my
friends
and
family
this
thing
gets
stuck
on
every
little
thing
the
suction
is
good
but
it
is
really
loud
the
suction
makes
the
battery
drain
really
fast
it
barely
completes
room
before
it
needs
to
charge
should
have
gone
with
one
that
retains
boundary
mapping
it
gets
hung
up
on
flipflops,
wires
from
surge
protectors
it
gets
stuck
under
the
entertainment
center
and
other
items
it
does
not
take
logical
routes
nor
does
it
complete
room
before
moving
on
it
leaves
and
comes
back
like
times
or
would
be
fine
bought
roomba
way
better
results
for
the
money
paid
you
could
just
pay
little
more
and
get
better
unit
decided
to
wait
for
little
bit
before
made
review
on
this
item
didn't
want
the
novelty
of
the
product
cloud
my
judgment
must
say
am
very
impressed
never
cease
to
be
amazed
by
the
amount
of
debris
that
it
picks
up
even
after
it
was
done
the
day
before
makes
you
kind
of
wonder
what
you're
living
with
even
though
you
think
you're
pretty
tidy
it's
low
profile
allows
it
to
slip
right
under
my
sofas
not
to
mention,
i'm
not
sure
who's
more
used
by
it,
my
husband
or
my
cat
it's
pretty
quiet,
it
goes
everywhere
and
it
parks
itself
when
it's
done
very
pleased
with
our
investment
this
robot
vacuum
is
great
bought
this
after
recommendation
from
friend
who
has
the
same
one
was
pretty
skeptical
about
how
well
it
would
work,
but
can't
believe
how
much
it
actually
picks
up
it
such
time
saver
have
it
run
every
couple
days
while
i'm
at
work
we
have
hardwood,
carpet
and
couple
rugs
in
the
area
have
it
setup
and
it
hasn't
gotten
stuck
under
anything
yet
which
is
huge
bonus
it's
also
super
quiet
which
is
plus
if
we
happen
to
be
home
when
it's
running
will
definitely
be
recommending
this
vacuum
to
few
friends
know
are
interested
in
one
great
product
have
been
using
roomba
irobot
for
years,
but
decided
to
try
this
brand
based
on
the
positive
reviews
this
vacuum
is
weak
and
unreliable
even
before
completely
breaking
down
in
less
than
month,
it
would
constantly
get
stuck,
miss
significant
areas,
and
had
such
weak
suction
that
much
of
the
dirt
and
dog
hair
was
still
left
behind
it
looks
nice
and
less
noisy
than
my
previous
irobots,
but
that
doesn't
make
up
for
the
other
problems
i'm
very
disappointed
rochelle
is
what
ve
named
her
why
you
ask
bc
am
an
hole,
and
after
bitching
for
two
weeks
about
spending
$200
for
someone
to
clean
my
house,
was
not
happy
with
results,
so
bought
robot
to
replace
michelle
can
handle
all
the
other
minor
things
asked
to
be
cleaned,
but
the
convenience
of
this
little
gadget
is
amazing
it
fits
under
my
bedroom
furniture
better
than
the
cleaner
did
with
broom
stick
and
swifter
runs
along
the
walls,
turns
around
and
goes
different
direction
when
it
gets
close
to
my
foot
took
the
dogs
about
week
and
half
to
get
used
to
the
vacuum
running
around
the
floor
best
investment
ever
i'm
quilter
&
after
going
through
number
of
expensive
irons,
decided
to
purchase
this
lowerpriced
iron
with
good
ratings
there
are
number
of
problems
with
this
iron
#1the
iron
is
advertised
as
selfcleaning
but
the
instruction
manual
has
not
one
word
on
how
to
accomplish
this
selfcleaning
#2
shortly
after
receiving
it
in
august,
it
started
to
leak
around
the
water
hole
the
"antileak"
mechanism
is
just
little
piece
of
plastic
that
supposed
to
lock
the
water
cover
down
ok,
that
wasn't
big
dealinconvenient,
yes,
but
not
deal
breaker
use
my
iron
almost
every
day
for
hours
at
time
#3
today
discovered
that
accidentally
left
the
iron
on
&
it
didn"t
turn
off
hours
later
when
went
back
into
my
sewing
room,
it
was
still
blazing
hot
now
recognize
that
it's
not
the
company'
fault
that
left
it
on
but
yikes,
there's
certain
no
"autoshut
off"
working
after
only
few
months
why
can't
anyone
make
decent
iron
wouldn't
bother
with
this
iron
just
got
it,
we
ran
it
and
it
worked
quite
well
this
seems
like
it
is
worth
the
small
investment
very
quiet
and
honestly
moves
fast
you
can
program
daily
cleaning
and
do
spot
single
room
cleaning
the
remote
is
easily
programmed
and
it
seems
to
charge
fast
like
said,
worth
the
small
investment
for
in
between
keep
up
before
my
weekly
cleaning,
ordered
the
extra
brushes
and
filter
set
for
the
future
too
just
to
keep
it
running
well

really
well

saved
lots
of
her
time
to
do
cleaning
,
and
she
doesn
need
to
worry
about
her
baby

get
dirty
on
the

this
vacuum
robot
has
more
budget
friendly
price
tag
comparing
to
the
other
brands
on
amazon
the
noise
level
is
fairly
quiet
and
can
keep
it
running
around
while
watching
tv
with
no
problem
the
sensors
work
well
that
it
can
avoid
all
the
random
toys
my
toddler
left
all
over
the
place**
the
remote
control
is
so
easy
to
use
that
even
my
yr
old
learnt
how
to
use
it
after
just
4days
:
never
thought
could
afford
robot
vacuum
saw
this
price
and
said,
"go
for
it"
have
german
shepherd
shedder
really
don't
need
to
say
anything
else
what
relief
to
know
can
turn
this
vacuum
on
and
all
of
the
dog
hair
that
accumulates,
every
day,
that
have
had
to
clean
up
for
10
yrs,
is
gone
that
easily
it
is
quiet,
took
nap
during
the
cycle,
it
transitions
from
floors
to
carpet
easily
and
never
gets
stuck
wish
had
bought
this
vacuum
sooner,
such
great
deal
very
nice
iron,
minimal
dripping
gets
much
hotter
than
myou
old
iron
and
much
faster
threw
old
iron
away
really
worked
great
on
quilting
cotton
to
get
all
wrinkles
out
very
pleased
with
this
iron
got
quality
iron
for
great
price
and
had
it
in
two
days
with
prime
shipping
great
steam
output
only
time
got
any
dripping
was
when
it
had
been
on
long
while
and
using
the
steam
gust
button
other
than
when
pressing
the
steam
gust
button
there
was
no
dripping
at
all
recommend
it
worked
ok
until
about
weeks
after
the
return
window
closed
it
had
an
easy
life
for
that
15
months,
mostly
cruising
around
on
hardwoods
and
always
with
cleaned
filter
and
dustbin
sure
it
got
itself
stuck
and
gave
up
sometimes
but
hey,
it
no
roomba
so
we
forgave
it
and
tried
again
one
day
it
basically
decided
it
was
never
turning
on
or
leaving
the
charging
station
again,
and
it
never
did
until
it
went
in
the
trash
you
get
what
you
pay
for
have
been
wanting
to
get
robot
cleaner
for
while
the
prices
for
robot
cleaner
are
very
high
then
decided
to
get
this
one
since
it
was
on
sale
this
one
works
so
great
at
such
decent
price
it
picks
up
the
dusts
and
small
pieces
litters
on
the
floor
it
doesn
make
as
loud
noise
as
thought
which
is
good
the
remote
control
is
very
convenient
love
it
it's
one
of
the
more
affordable
robovacuums
on
the
market,
but
it
keeps
the
house
clean
it
doesn't
go
in
any
sort
of
pattern
it
just
bounces
from
one
wall
to
the
next
in
random
passes
sometimes
it
just
turns
for
no
reason
my
wife
still
likes
it
because
it
keeps
the
house
looking
fresh
like
it
because
don't
have
to
vacuum
as
much
with
the
upright
this
robot
is
seriously
life
saver
love
how
quiet
it
is
and
it
very
effective
it
picks
up
most
dirt,
we
have
had
absolutely
no
issues
with
ours
it
fits
under
everything
and
gets
in
tight
spaces,
it
picks
up
ton
of
dust
and
cat
hair
this
is
must
have
for
pet
owners
we
love
it
and
it
does
an
amazing
job
with
our
cat
hair

this
item
has
changed
our
apartment
completely
we
run
it
daily,
and
every
day
am
astounded
by
how
much
this
guy
picks
up
off
our
floor
walk
in
and
the
whole
apartment
feels
cleaner,
am
much
more
comfortable
walking
around
without
slippers
or
socks,
and
it
gets
us
to
take
care
about
what
we
leave
on
the
floor
it
can
occasionally
get
caught
on
something,
but
this
just
encourages
us
to
keep
our
cords
organized
and
the
whole
place
neater
would
recommend
got
this
few
days
ago
so
had
few
days
to
test
it
out
before
writing
review
originally
had
one
of
those
handheld
steamers
but
it
wouldn't
nearly
get
the
job
done
as
perfectly
as
this
straight
iron
steamer
wear
dress
shirts
for
work
mostly
everyday
so
needed
something
that
would
rid
of
all
those
creases
left
on
my
shirts
and
its
easy
to
use
the
iron
heats
up
fairly
quickly
too
purchased
this
to
replace
an
old
iron
and
must
say
the
steam
feature
on
this
product
works
like
magic
love
itautomatically
turns
off
if
you
leave
it
on
too
long
which
is
great
for
me
there
even
selfcleaning
feature
which
ve
never
seen
on
any
iron
before
anti
drip
and
water
tank
hold
good
amount
of
water
great
iron
no
need
to
shell
out
more
than
$200
for
fancy
name
brand
robot
vacuum
this
thing
does
the
same
job
at
fraction
of
the
costi
normally
run
it
every
other
day
and
am
impressed
with
how
much
it
picks
up,
even
though
the
floors
look
immaculately
cleani
originally
bought
this
to
see
my
cats
ride
it
but
they
have
yet
to
jump
on
yet,
unfortunately
this
is
my
first
irobot
and
love
it
you
can
set
the
schedule
when
you
want
it
to
start
vacuum
throughout
the
day
or
night
and
the
sensor
on
this
is
very
accurate
it
literally
can
spot
wall
inch
part
and
move
another
direction
you
can
even
control
where
you
want
it
to
go
on
your
remote
the
little
ones
at
home
loves
playing
around
with
it
and
usually
use
it
like
car
to
drive
around
the
house
thats
there
way
of
cleaning
like
how
its
not
loud
at
all
when
it
first
start
even
on
max
setting
the
nose
is
tolerable
would
recommend
this
product
to
my
friends
and
family
or
even
give
as
gift,
the
price
is
decent
for
irobot,
not
to
crazy
expensive
my
home
has
hard
floors
but
it
works
well
there
is
thin
carpet
in
the
living
room
it
is
always
easy
to
pass
small
robot
with
high
horsepower
can
always
clean
my
home
for
me,
but
it
is
very
noisy
and
replaces
the
vacuum
cleaner
when
it
is
about
to
finish
its
work,
it
will
run
and
charge
itself
this
is
cute
will
recommend
it
purchased
this
iron
in
may,
2020
because
of
the
good
reviews
it
had
and
now
wish
had
saved
my
money
it
spits
and
sputters
water
out
constantly
and
the
sole
plate
is
impossible
to
keep
clean
do
not
use
any
type
of
spray
starch,
etc
so
that
isn't
the
problem
do
quilting
and
have
to
clean
the
sole
plate
with
wet
rag
before
can
iron
any
fabric
or
else
it
will
drag
on
the
fabric,
develop
white
film
on
the
bottom
and
leave
strange
marks
on
the
fabric
that
are
hard
to
get
off
i've
followed
the
instructions
for
the
iron
carefully
so
don't
know
what
the
problem
is
will
be
purchasing
new
iron
very
soon
and
this
one
will
become
trash
always
thought
kept
clean
floors
until
got
the
bagotte
had
just
vacuumed
when
decided
to
use
it
and
it
packed
more
dirt
than
could
ever
imagine
it
really
works
and
works
well
and
no
more
getting
down
on
my
knees
to
clean
under
the
bed
because
my
bagotte
loves
to
clean
under
the
bed
used
to
cough
lot
at
night
due
to
dust
allergies,
but
now
sleep
peacefully
through
the
night
because
of
there
is
dust/dirt
to
be
found,
the
bagotte
will
find
it
highly
recommend
it
it
cannot
clean
my
floor
well,sometimes
have
to
reclean
the
floor
myself
the
program
carried
on
this
device
does
not
seem
to
work
well
on
stuck
corners
as
well
my
only
complaint
was
that
it
did
not
come
with
magnetic
tape
went
to
the
store
and
purchase
my
own
magnetic
tape
but
it
didn't
work
so
just
put
other
things
in
its
path
if
don't
want
the
vacuum
to
go
thereotherwise
love
this
vacuum
it
is
thin
enough
to
go
everywhere
need
it
is
very
quiet
very
easy
to
use
all
the
way
around
nice
large
dustbin
just
like
it
promised
nothing
difficult
to
it
don't
have
to
worry
about
hooking
it
up
to
wifi
somehow
loli
absolutely
love
this
vacuum
and
would
highly
recommend
it
and
already
have
my
sister
is
going
to
purchase
one
for
her
son's
birthday
she
has
an
amazon
prime
account
also
for
long
time
best
thing
i've
ever
bought
as
far
as
cleaning
goes
it
does
all
the
work
for
me
was
vacuuming
about
times
day
but
now
just
spot
vacuum
with
my
cordless
vacuum
the
robot
does
the
rest
simple
and
easy
design
climbs
up
mats
and
carpet
well
has
great
battery
no
complaints
product
did
not
match
prescription
it
is
not
quality
product,
does
not
pick
up
dusts
thoroughly
and
does
not
have
great
sensor
as
well
surprised
by
the
quality
of
this
robot
vacuum
it
works
best
on
hard
flooring
surfaces
the
collection
chamber
is
small
but
easy
to
clean
based
on
pricing
alone,
this
is
much
better
than
roomba
not
for
deep
cleaning
this
type
of
vacuums
are
for
light
duty
cleaning
and
daily
maintenance
pics
up
dog
hair
well
use
it
primarily
on
my
tiled
deck
also
very
happy
it
fits
under
my
bed
that
is
calikibg
and
difficult
to
reach
under
my
family
and
love
this
incredible
robot
vacuum
it
does
and
amazing
job
on
floor
and
carpets
also
it
is
very
easy
and
simple
to
hook
up
my
children
loves
that
they
don't
have
to
be
pushing
regular
vacuum
they
just
have
to
give
start
and
the
robot
do
their
jobs
after
is
finished

update:
the
battery
life
on
this
doesn't
last
very
long
it
will
run
and
then
the
light
shows
up
and
needs
to
be
charged
at
least,
think
that's
what
it
is
i'm
constantly
cleaning
the
filters,
the
dirt
box,
the
rollers,
etc
and
nothing
seems
to
help
i'm
not
very
happy
with
this
anymorenot
as
quiet
as
thought,
though
it
is
quieter
than
our
vacuum
doesn't
suck
as
much
either

used
this
vacuum
on
both
hardwood
floors
and
rugs
works
great
on
both
didn
damage
any
of
my
rugs
or
scratch
any
of
my
hardwood
floors
super
easy
to
operate
and
charge
good
suction
power
to
clean
rugs
smart
sensing
technology
was
able
to
get
accustomed
to
the
floor
plan
of
my
house
in
just
days
makes
cleaning
the
house
so
much
easier
hate
vacuuming
love
this
vacuuming
robot
this
robot
has
changed
my
life
went
from
person
with
kids
and
pets
with
constantly
dirty
floors,
to
brand
new
sparkling
clean
life
having
clean
floors
inspires
me
to
keep
other
things
tidier
too
every
time
use
it
at
least
once
day
clean
out
the
dirt
receptacle,
and
am
amazed
at
how
much
filth
is
in
there
the
only
downside
is
that
i've
managed
to
lose
the
remote
somewhere
in
my
house,
but
thankfully
there
is
an
autorun
setting
on
the
robot
itself
did
my
research
and
this
works
for
everything
need
an
iron
to
do
it
does
both
dry
heat
and
steam,
or
stream
of
water
chose
this
one
because
of
the
extra
large
water
reservoir
and
because
can
iron
for
almost
20
min
and
only
13
with
some
other
ones
with
this
vacuum,
it
is
little
bit
hard
to
understand
how
to
control
the
pathway
other
than
that,
the
suction
is
great
just
in
one
small
room,
the
canister
filled
up
had
just
vacuumed
the
day
before
with
my
powerful
cleaner
great
for
touchups
really
loved
this
iron
until
it
just
stopped
working
bought
it
in
july
and
lasted
months
will
see
how
the
warranty
works
but
if
have
to
ship
it
back
somewhere
it
won't
be
worth
it
what
shame
am
very
disappointed
my
iron
broke
the
steam
would
not
come
out
when
press
the
button
so
bought
this
to
replace
my
old
one
and
this
one
literally
can
say
is
my
best
iron
ve
had
the
steam
pressure
button
comes
out
very
strong
comparing
it
to
my
old
one
this
one
beats
it
very
easy

the
floor
robot
is
really
practical
since
had
it,
it
took
me
very
little
time
to
get
broom
and
sweep
the
floor
carpet,
tile,
wood
board
can
be
cleaned
very
clean
there's
lot
less
dust
in
the
house
now
its
noise
is
also
very
low
every
day
at
midnight,
it
begins
to
sweep
the
floor
and
goes
back
to
recharge
its
batteries
don't
worry
about
it
running
out
of
power
good
price
highly
recommended

this
is
my
first
robot
vacuum
ever
and
so
far
it
is
totally
worth
the
price
it
able
to
clean
tight
corners
and
go
underneath
most
of
my
furnitures
it
also
comes
with
an
extra
set
of
brushes
and
filters
in
which
you
replace
it
in
the
future
the
remote
control
allows
you
to
set
up
for
schedule
to
just
simply
control
the
direction,
or
to
make
the
vacuum
go
back
to
the
charging
station,
which
is
very
handy
like
previously
said,
this
is
totally
worth
it
cost,
and
great
way
to
get
rid
of
some
chores

have
never
owned
robot
vacuum
but
have
been
looking
into
them
for
very
long
time
decided
to
go
with
more
budget
option
to
see
if
would
like
it
and
was
surprised
this
thing
is
way
better
than
was
expecting
it
vacuumed
my
entire
apartment
almost
as
good
as
doing
it
by
hand
it
also
very
sleek
and
looks
really
nice
this
is
great
product,
especially
for
the
money
am
so
happy
with
this
robot
vacuum
have
health
issues
and
now
can
have
clean
carpets
at
push
of
button
this
rolling,
but
it
is

this
was
the
first
robot
vacuum
that
have
bought
and
so
far,
it
seems
worth
the
price
it
was
pretty
easy
to
set
up
schedule
for
the
robot
to
automatically
vacuum
the
floor
brought
it
upstairs
once
and
forgot
to
close
the
door
and
it
almost
fell
down
the
stairs
but
there
are
anti
fall
sensors
on
it
so
it
would
stop
right
before
the
stairs
overall,
would
say
this
is
solid
product
for
the
price
have
had
this
about
15
weeks
it
appears
the
self
charging/auto
return
to
charge
does
not
function
also
it
gets
hung
up
on
smaller
rugs
and
moves
my
kitchen
mats
to
over
the
heating/ac
registers
very
disappointed
also
pretty
loud
operating
motor
impressed
with
this
product
and
i'm
so
glad,
purchased
it
this
vacuum
has
good
cleaning
power
suction
and
it's
quietthis
really
works
in
taking
out
all
the
dust
from
the
home
and
goes
around
randomly
to
pick
the
stuffits
charging
is
also
good
it
cleans
all
the
first
floor
in
one
charge
around
roomstested
it
on
both
the
hard
floor
and
carpet
and
works
really
well
it's
easy
to
clean

that
there
is

of
dust
in
it
and
the
hair
on
the
floor
tiles

well

even
go

itself
with
just
one
click
on
the
remote

the
base
for
charging
my
son

far
since

something
that

make
noises
wouldn't
recommend
it
don't
mind
it
also
tend
to
get
suck
on
low
tables

edit:
after
using
it
for
week,
the
vacuum
cleaner
stopped
working
it
would
not
charge
even
after
hours
very
much
disappointed
returned
this
item
because
the
automatic
shut
off
did
not
work
it
should
have
shut
off
after
minutes
of
not
being
used
also
did
not
like
that
when
the
iron
was
sitting
upright
the
cord
was
touching
the
iron
board
which
in
time
might
damage
that
part
of
the
cord
big
disappointment,
therefore
the
return
also
didn't
think
the
cord
was
long
enough
we
love
bruce
we
named
it
bruce
cleansteen
easy
to
use
it
does
get
little
confused
when
you
try
to
send
it
home
but
that's
okay
it
cleans
hardwoods
really
well
let
just
say,
buying
more
so
convenient
and
conversation
piece
goes
over
the

more
than
once,
but
give
it

for
week,
and
love
it
is
easy
to
set
up,

runs
quietly
with
good
suction
and
smooth
turns
worth
the
price
works
great
does
great
job
the
cleaning
effect
is
not
satisfactory
there
is
still
dust
in
the
cleaned
area
it
is
not
clever
or
even
bit
clumsy
its
brush
will
fall
off
during
use
and
often
get
stuck
and
can
move
going
to
return
it
unfortunately,
it
not
good
experience
for
me
much
better
than
expected
now
only
need
to
use
my
vacuum
cleaner
like
once
every
weeks
this
thing
is
very
easy
to

it
irons
very
well,
am
volunteering
during
the

to
make
masks,
and
bought
this
iron
to

the
masks
was
able
to
iron
out
the
creases
in
one
or
two
passes,
it
is
lightweight
and
has
all
the
features
for
pretty
cheap
price
so
far
so
good
love
this
machine,
it
is
so
quiet,
has
good
suction
and
climbs
over
carpets
beautifully

outstanding
customer
service
highly
recommend
this
product
just
received
my
bagotte
and
very
pleased
with
its
performance
except,
it
goes
from
room
to
room
before
finishing
but
will
go
back
eventually
also
the
run
time
was
about
one
hour
hope
this
will
improve
in
time
this
thing
is
amazing
run
it
almost
every
day
and
am
constantly
amazed
at
the
amount
of
crap
it
picks
up
each
time
with
puppy
and
house
full
of
girls
who
also
shed,
this
thing
is
lifesaver
this
is
my
first
iron
after
several
times
used
it
am
so
glad
choose
this
one
the
temperatures
control
is
easily
seen
on
the
handle,
it
works
really
good
it
worked
beautifully
on
tiled
floor
the
water
sprayer
doesn
work
but
the
steam
works
well
this
steam
iron
is
very
convenient
to
use
and
has
nice
design
after
receiving
it,
can
use
it
easily
and
the
effect
is
very
good
love
this
item
my
floors
stay
clean
and
it
picks
up
dust
very
well
was
bit
difficult
figuring
out
where
the
area
for
filter
was
and
plus
remote
wasn
the
simplest
to
read
the
signs
on
itgot
to
pick
up
animal
fur
and
did
great
this
iron
feels
light
,
very
easy
to
use
nothing
fancy
but
has
all
the
functions
and
gets
the
job
done
good
steam
pressure
build
quality
seems
ok
for
the
price
over
all
good
value
for
the
money
and
quality
suction
isn
great,
but
good
enoughbattery
could
last
longer,
but
we
haven
vacuumed
in
whileworth
the
$150
so
far
like
my
robot
cleaner
up
to
this
day
like
it
most
that
don
need
to
move
furnitures
and
get
the
dust
underneath
on
my
wood
floor
love
my
bagotte
rarely
need
to
touch
my
broom
anymore
it
is
so
nice
to
come
home
to
vacuumed
house
each
day
wish
would
have
purchased
this
vacuum
years
ago
by
bagotte
justed
turned
one
year
old
so
decided
to
buy
another
,so
could
stop
carrying
it
upstairs
after
it
cleaned
the
first
floor
at
night
great
price
and
still
cleaning
after
one
year
,
no
problems
love
this
,
gets
under
the
beds
under
my
tables
it's
great
product
it's
been
used
several
times,
it's
convenient,
it
saves
time,
it's
very
light,
it's
suitable
for
home
use
according
to
the
product
description,
the
steam
can
work
vertically,
but
in
fact
it
cann't
so
gave
stars
great
steam
feature,
light
weight
and
easy
to
use
wish
the
pitcher
for
filling
the
water
reservoir
was
bit
larger
thought
ordered
1500
watt
iron,
arrived
as
1200
watt
looked
like
it
had
been
refurbished
ordered
new
ironwill
be
sending
back
for
original
order
this
product
works
well
for
the
price
wish
the
battery
life
was
bit
longer
have
yet
to
figure
out
how
to
get
it
to
map
the
room
,
but
the
remote
helps
to
guide
it
when
needed,
and
the
auto
timer
is
great
vacuum
worked
good
until
last
week,
battery
dies
in
15
minutes
after
start
unreal
for
cheap
iron,
works
as
well
as
any
expensive
iron
ve
used
buy
it
can
believe
how
well
this
picks
up
dust
and
cat
hair

couldn
be
any
happier
with
this
vacuum
love
it

roomba
forever
after
this
thing
it
gets
stuck
on
everything,
especially
furnace
intake
and
loves
to
eat
cords
so
unimpressed
just
what
was
looking
light
weight
easy
to
used
iron
out
all
the
wrinkles
excellent
value
for
the
price
liked
the
iron
in
general
at
first
but
regular
dripping
and
changes
in
heat
without
cause
forced
me
to
return
the
iron
it
stuck
sometime
under
the
bed
do
the
random
vacuum
some
time
miss
the
spot
we
love
this
little
robot
picks
up
soo
much
sort
everyday
and
is
super
quiet
can
even
let
him
run
when
we
have
guests
over
this
steam
iron
is
very
light,but
it
is
very
effective
have
used
it
several
times,
so
far
so
good
this
iron
is
very
easy
to
use
added
100ml
of
water
did
denim
skirt
and
it
quickly
smoothies

very
like
it
this
is
so
good
and
marvelous
that
my
pants

so
smooth
andwarm
my
vacuum,

rosie,
is
very
quiet
and
does
fantastic
job
of
sweeping
both
hardwood
and
carpeted
floors

hot
in
spurts
no

on
my
wood
floors
and
low
carpets
has
great
suction

so
far
am
loving
it
productb
was
just
fine
until
it
suddenly
stopped
working
the
month
after
the
return
window
closed
love
how
it
can
go
under
sofa,
tv
stand
and
more
so
glad
purchased
this
item
and
at
great
price
works
great
on
tile
floors,
gets
almost
all
the
cat
hair
and
dust
up
worked
great
for
the
first
few
months
now
will
not
go
forward
so
it
lo
longer
works
like
the
robot
vacuum,
but
need
to
order
the
brushes
for
it,
they
don't
last
long
the
battery
dead
quickly
like
30
mins
after
full
charged
not

like

bought
this
in
january
2020
and
by
july
2020
it
does
not
come
on
the
product
is
really
good
happy
with
the
product
quality
epic
works
great
to
time,
but
worked
just
mo
has
good
suction
power
impressed
how
well
it
cleans,
better
than
my
other
vacuum
awesome
wish
it
climbed
stairs
received
broken
iron,
super
disappointed
this
is
my
1st
experience
with
robot
vacuum,
so
my
expectations
may
have
been
too
high
have
around
1000
square
foot
main
floor,
tile
and
wood
with
throw
rugs
in
general,
it
cleans
much
better
than
expected
if
it
gets
to
area
but
there
are
two
short
comings
it
doesn't
clean
up
to
the
baseboards
well
at
all
its
avoidance
algorithm
won't
let
it
get
close
but
once
in
while
and
it
gets
stuck
frequently
and
even
more
frequently,
it
can't
find
its
way
back
to
its
base
had
hoped
could
start
it
and
leave
the
house
can'tthere
seem
to
be
two
things
that
cause
it
to
get
stuck
the
sweepers
go
under
throw
rugs
unless
they
are
very
heavy
the
vac
goes
on
top
so
it
just
gets
stuck
there
it
usually
emits
beep
when
this
happens
can
hear
it
in
most
parts
of
the
house,
so
can
move
it
and
restart
it
the
other
case
is
my
narrow
path
between
wall
and
desk
the
path
is
about
feet
long,
and
couple
of
feet
wide
there
is
the
straight
path
out
and
couple
of
ways
out
under
the
desk
it
seems
like
it
should
find
it's
way
out,
but
it
apparently
sees
desk
leg
and
turns
around
even
it
wouldn't
have
come
very
close
to
it
so
it
just
goes
back
and
forth
randomly
in
this
small
area
forever
have
to
listen
for
this
and
retrieve
it
or
it
will
run
the
battery
down
and
shut
off
and,
if
it
happens
early
in
it's
cycle,
it
puts
huge
amount
of
wear
on
this
small
section
of
carpet
have
to
block
off
this
entire
areaoverall,
this
means
have
to
hand
vacuum
frequently,
not
just
for
the
extra
cleaning
power,
but
to
cover
areas
it
missed
if
had
it
to
do
over,
would
spend
the
extra
money
to
buy
unit
that
follows
map
this
one
takes
too
much
baby
sitting
it
save
some
work,
but
less
than
expected
yet,
do
have
to
admit,
it
vacuums
what
it
covers
very
well
and
covers
most
of
the
areas
that
tend
to
accumulate
the
most
dirt
the
dining
area
and
entrances
to
the
house
and
this
reduces
the
frequency
of
manual
vacuumingupdate:
12/30/20
gave
up
on
it
and
lowered
my
ranking
from
to
stars
over
couple
of
months,
it
got
stuck
around
2/3
of
the
time
and
about
half
the
time
when
it
was
stuck,
it
didn't
know
it
so
it
continued
to
vacuum
the
same
space
over
and
over
that
caused
some
damage
decided
to
use
it
would
have
to
monitor
it
very
closely
so
do
not
recommend
it
for
most
people
replaced
it
with
the
roomba
i6+
the
navigation
on
the
i6
is
far
superior
it
has
not
gotten
stuck
in
months
of
2x
per
week
usage
on
the
other
hand,
the
i6
doesn't
clean
quite
as
well
overall
and
being
bigger
the
i6
doesn't
squeeze
get
some
chairs
as
wellbottom
line
is
that
the
bagotte
might
be
good
vac
for
simple
room
with
no
obstructions,
but
its
not
for
our
house

we,
like
others,
have
busy
lives
and
don't
always
vacuum
as
much
as
we
should
i'll
admit
that
am
more
so
the
guilty
party
other
than
my
significant
other
we
have
dyson
pet
vacuum,
but
it
does
not
have
enough
juice
to
reach
our
entire
home
as
such,
we
sought
for
supplement
to
the
weekly
vacuuming
to
help
us
during
the
busy
work
week
few
notes
for
these
thoughts
we
have
onelevel
condo
that
is
approximately
1800
sq
ft
the
majority
of
our
space
contains
laminate
flooring
or
lowpile
carpet
cannot
comment
on
the
nature
of
the
vacuum
for
highpile
carpet
or
for
multilevel
dwellingsthe
good:1
this
vacuum
is
much
quieter
than
our
dyson
animal
vacuum

this
vacuum
is
lowprofile
it
can
reach
underneath
couches
and
all
of
the
furniture
in
our
house
with
ease
thicker
vacuums
may
pose
issues,
but
this
bagotte
vacuum
reaches
more
than
our
cordless
vacuum
can
and
in
passive
manner,
too3
two
brushes
rotate
on
the

of
the
vacuumsee
the

replacement
is
easy,

they

this

vacuum
can
navigate
several
challenging
surfaces,
like
mats
and
changes
in
flooring
material

see
this,
please

with

mat
with
no
problem5
suction
is
greatboth
hair
and
larger
particles
are
cleaned
we
have
seen
noticeable
difference
in
the
kitchen,
where
we
often
drop
crumbs
from
cooking
we
also
have
issues
with
cat
food
being
scattered
by
our
feline
friends
this
is
problem
no
more6
remote
is
included
for
fine
control
and
scheduling
the
vacuum
seems
fairly
smart
and
the
programming
meets
our
needs7
the
battery
seems
to
work
fine
and
charging
is
breeze;
the
vacuum
knows
when
to
return
to
its
charging
station8
we
live
on
the
second
floor
of
condo
complex
and
have
an
entryway
that
leads
immediately
upstairs
the
vacuum
recognizes
the
single
flight
of
stairs
we
have
and
avoids
fallingthe
bad
aka
other
comments:**
am
unsure
how
this
vacuum
would
navigate
highpile
carpet
we
have
none
in
our
condo,
so
please
check
other
comments
before
purchasingoverall:**
this
vacuum
is
an
excellent
supplement
to
our
fulltime
vacuum
with
the
addition
of
this
machine,
we
have
greatly
reduced
our
cleaning
load
while
would
not
use
such
vacuum
for
fulltime
cleaning
responsibilities,
it
allows
for
some
peace
of
mind
during
the
busy
weeks
intended
to
replace
my
rowenta
iron
of
many
years
with
another
rowenta
then
read
the
reviews
for
rowenta
half
their
product
line
is
now
made
in
china
instead
of
germany
and
even
the
models
made
in
germany
received
horrible
reviews
so
many
that
it
clearly
wasn't
just
an
occasional
customer
so
searched
for
an
alternatemy
first
choice
was
pursteam
with
ceramic
sole
plate
i'd
never
used
ceramic
sole
plate
but
it
was
touted
to
be
very
smooth
gliding
not
at
all
strike
and
the
damned
thing
beeped
all
the
time
it
beeped
when
set
it
down
to
reposition
my
shirt
it
beeped
again
when
resumed
ironing
very
annoying
strike
finally,
it
would
drip
bit
from
the
bottom
ports
of
the
sole
plate
strike
3so
bought
this
iron
decided
that
since
didn't
want
to
spend
$80+
for
rowenta
that
is
likely
to
be
hunk
junk
and
having
already
spent
about
$40
on
pursteam
that
was
hunk
of
junk
that
would
find
something
cheap
in
case
it,
too,
was
hunk
of
junk
used
it
for
the
first
time
today
and
here
is
my
report:sole
plate
glides
nicely
light
weight
heats
up
surprisingly
quickly
no
beeps
water
reservoir
is
easy
to
see
plenty
of
steam
doesn't
leakso,
combined,
spent
as
much
on
this
iron
and
the
pursteam
as
rowenta
wish
had
just
bought
this
to
start
with
take
your
lesson
from
me
we
previously
bought
robot
vacuum
similar
to
this
one
and
love
it
it
is
so
handy
to
have
the
floors
vacuumed
at
the
push
of
button
our
first
vacuum
had
feature
that
allows
operation
through
our
mobile
device
but
we
never
used
it
since
our
living
room
is
sunk
about
inches
we
needed
to
buy
another
so
one
can
remain
in
the
living
area
while
another
tackles
the
rest
of
the
house
this
vacuum
was
on
sale
at
great
price
and
we
couldn
find
anything
that
could
beat
its
value
get
pretty
excited
when
we
not
only
strike
great
deal
but
the
vacuum
arrives
and
works
better
than
our
last
one
was
able
to
place
the
docking
station
under
one
of
our
kitchen
cabinets
after
removing
the
toe
kick
panel
that
means
at
the
push
of
button
on
the
remote,
this
vacuum
rolls
out
from
under
the
cabinet
like
secret
agent,
vacuums
our
kitchen,
dining
area,
and
laundry
room
and
is
docked
and
fully
charged
when
we
wake
up
in
the
morning
this
vacuum
works
great
and
at
this
price
was
an
awesome
value
the
best
purchase
in
years
am
in
love
with
this
little
vacuum
am
so
impressed
with
how
smart
and
efficient
it
is
it
learns
your
house
and
gets
smarter
with
each
use
have
animals
that
shed
lot
and
it
picks
up
all
the
hair
as
well
as
crumbs
left
behind
by
the
boys
that
live
here
it
is
quiet
and
find
it
seriously
therapeutic
to
sit
back
and
watch
it
clean
since
am
normally
the
only
person
that
ever
cleans
anything
in
my
house
am
so
happy
to
have
this
little
helper
the
dirt
trap
holds
plenty
and
it
will
clean
for
long
duration
over
an
hour
without
having
to
recharge
sure
outlasts
me
it
has
great
suction
and
these
little
brushes
that
propel
out
the
sides
to
catch
dirt
in
the
cracks
and
corners
so
it
doesn
miss
thing
there
are
replaceable
dust
filters
and
sure
this
will
help
reduce
allergens
in
my
house
for
the
allergy
sufferers
that
visit
would
highly
recommend
purchasing
this
vacuum
you
will
not
be
disappointed
all
can
say
is
wow
own
shark
which
replaced
bobsweep,
my
shark
after
just
year
is
on
its
last
leg
decided
to
try
something
totally
new
and
boy
am
impressednot
only
does
it
maneuver
its
way
around
obstacles
like
no
other
robotic
vacuum
ve
owned,
it
impressively
quiet
it
sleek
and
modern
looking,
picks
ups
everything
in
its
pathit
suction
is
even
powerful
enough
to
get
the
dirt
off
of
my
area
rug
which
my
other
robots
could
not
do
also
the
large
dust
bin
is
huge
benefit
,
it
larger
than
any
of
the
other
robotic
vacuums
ve
owned
,
which
is
awesome
because
don
have
to
empty
it
out
so
often
,amazing
price
point
the
low
profile
design
works
perfectly
for
me
too
absolutely
love
ithighly
recommend
we
ve
only
been
using
it
for
week,
but
so
far
so
good
it
definitely
covers
all
of
the
rooms
and
does
good
job
vacuuming
you
can
hear
it
rev
up
when
it
encounters
carpet
and
see
the
path
it
has
cleaned
the
battery
lasts
long
time
it
is
fairly
quiet
you
don
want
it
to
be
silent
or
you
wouldn
know
which
room
it
is
in
ve
also
been
very
impressed
with
the
customer
service
had
little
incident
100%
my
fault
that
required
customer
service
and
the
seller
responded
immediately
and
offered
fantastic
service
and
assistance
we
have
been
pleased
with
our
purchase
and
feel
it
is
good
value
for
the
price
all
the
positive
reviews
are
accurate
decided
to
take
leap
of
faith
after
watching
few
video
reviews
and
reading
many
amazon
reviewspros:
great
suction
power,
long
running
time,
great
price,
can
be
started
remotely,
low
profile
27
so
it
was
able
to
fit
under
all
my
furniture
and
kitchen
cabinets,
only
takes
hours
to
charge,
great
on
all
floor
types
and
large
dirt/dust
canistercons:
does
not
having
mapping
feature
so
it
travels
randomly
but
it
didn
bother
me
because
it
was
able
to
tackle
the
1700
sq
ft
of
floors
also,
it
wasn
able
to
make
it
back
to
the
charging
station
in
time
before
it
battery
ran
out,
but
in
its
defense,
it
was
on
the
other
side
of
the
house
therefore,
had
to
carry
it
back
and
place
it
on
the
charging
station
again,
this
wasn
big
deal
for
me
overall,
extremely
impressed
with
this
powerful
robot
vacuum

this

really
want
to
give
this
product
good
review
,
since
it
save
me
lot
time
to
clean
my
floor
have
two
kids
,
one
is
just
month
old
,
so
he
picks
everything
on
the
floor
to
eat,
with
this
vacuum
,
didn
need
to
keep
vacuum
,
it
also
very
smart,
compared
this
with
rock
,
same
fectures
,
but
save
me
more
than
half
on
costs
this
thing
is
trooper
it
has
been
great
for
keeping
our
floors
clean
during
shedding
season
it
cant
reach
every
nook
and
cranny
but
it
does
the
vast
majority
of
the
floor
can
use
picker
upper
tool
to
get
into
the
hard
spots
highly
recommend
for
those
that
don
want
to
sweep
or
run
vacuum
every
day
the
dcenta
1500watts
high
power
steam
iron,
heats
up
quite
quickly,
different
modes
of
temperature
and
steam
control,
automatic
shutdown
in
minutes,
does
not
burn
clothes
and
automatically
cleans
itself
you
can
iron
different
types
of
fabric,
such
as
cotton,
synthetic,
silk,
etc
dry
or
wet
iron,
either
dry
or
wet
clothes
why
was
so
late
to
getting
in
on
robot
vacs
love
her
she
drives
around
every
day
at
3pm
and
always
shocked
at
how
much
dust,
dog
fur,
and
hair
she
picks
up
almost
seems
impossible
that
that
much
is
there
to
be
picked
up
day
after
day
great
little
vacuum
we
love
this
thing,
it
picks
up
more
than
our
other
one
and
our
favorite
feature
is
that
it
charges
itself
our
other
one
will
do
ok
but
it
ends
up
lost
and
not
charged
the
only
think
that
struggle
with
is
the
remote,
but
my
kids
do
really
well
with
it
so
it
might
be
an
age
thing
have
animal
allergies
and
this
takes
care
of
the
times
inbetween
my
housecleaning
service
comes
to
clean
every
two
weeks
have
hairy
dog,
so
after
days,
need
to
empty
this
beats
asking
my
husband
to
break
out
the
larger
vacuum

times
used
now
it
barely
picks
up
the
dog
hair
on
the
carpet
your
browser
does
not
support
html5
video
we
have
tile
and
its
able
to
get
in
there
also
like
that
it
can
transition
to
shag
rug
without
issues
very
disappointed
with
this
purchase
and
past
the
return
window
by
about
week
the
iron
leaks
water
all
over
my
clothes
would
not
recommend
at
all
iron
is
definitely
worth
the
money
easy
to
use
and
looks
modern
enough
for
my
needs
easy
to
use
gets
the
job
done
it
works
really
well
used
it
to
clean
my
carpet
see
above
excellent
suction
and
speed
it
stops
lot
works
well,
only
thing
that
isn
great
is
that
it
doesn
automatically
go
back
to
the
doc
when
done
love
it
leaks
when
on
side,
wont
turn
off
it
works
perfectly
fine
as
it
is
described
online
we
like
it
very
much
reasonably
quiet
and
effective
vacuum
very
pleased
goes
from
tile
to
carpet
no
problem
