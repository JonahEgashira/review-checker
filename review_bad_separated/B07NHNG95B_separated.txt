great
wasn
sure
at
first
whether
they
would
be
absorbent
enough,
and
they
do
feel
little
unusual
to
use,
but
they
work
wonderfully
so
thin
and
lightweight
too
the
size
is
perfect
for
easily
fitting
in
our
bag
for
camping,
and
they
even
wrap
fully
around
my
size
16/18
tall
frame
lol
when
opened
the
wrapper
thought
ooh
these
feel
funny
for
microfiber
only
had
my
cleaning
cloths
in
microfiber
and
these
are
nothing
like
them
but
then
had
shower
and
thought
here
goes
but
they
are
fab
patt
rather
than
rub
and
you
are
dry
so
quick
and
they
are
still
dry
no
soggy
towels
will
be
buying
another
set
amazing
both
came
into
this
mesh
bag
couldn't
believe
the
size
of
them
fantastic
absorbent
microfiber
material
super
lightweight
great
for
holidays
or
just
to
keep
in
your
car
for
them
unexpected
needs
they
are
huge
ve
already
purchased
similar
microfibre
towel
for
my
hubby
&
parents
from
different
brands
bought
from
seller
as
loved
the
print
&
got
in
pack;
the
smaller
one
which
intended
to
use
for
my
toddleri
pleased
with
the
product
as
the
size
is
just
right
for
petite
person
like
myself
and
the
small
one
can
be
used
for
face
towel
or
during
travel
had
these
in
my
save
for
later
in
my
basket
for
some
time
as
was
looking
for
set
of
towels
to
take
on
holiday
for
my
two
little
girls
but
didn't
want
something
bulkythese
arrived
and
what
love
is
that
they
have
their
own
little
bag
they
are
perfect
size
for
my
girls
and
they
won't
take
up
too
much
room
in
the
suitcase
they
are
not
hugely
thick,
but
that's
because
they
are
microfiber
highly
recommend
these
towels
especially
if
you
are
travelling
overseas
they
are
not
bulky
to
pack,dry
quickly
and
the
what
like
best
is
that
the
sand
does
not
stick
to
the
towels
product
of
good
quality
have
bought
for
my
holidays,
they
are
of
good
size
and
very
attractive
design
easy
to
fit
in
suitcase,
has
resistance
and
dry
very
fast
recommend
them
excellent
towel
we
took
them
on
our
snorkeling
trip
lightweight
take
up
much
less
space
than
normal
towels
excellent
drying
you
off
after
being
in
the
water
and
really
quick
drying
there
are
far
more
expensive
versions
which
looked
at
buying
but
really
happy
chose
these
has
half
the
price
but
just
as
good
highly
recommended
really
impressed
with
the
design
&
handy
little
bag
they
come
in
have
used
this
type
of
towel
before
so
know
what
to
expect
when
we
use
them
just
perfect
for
the
beach
&
travel
etc
stars
well
deserved
due
to
weight
limit
didn't
want
to
over
load
case
with
heavy
tick
beach
towels
bought
pack
of
the
towels
but
ended
up
buying
another
pack
so
and
my
husband
had
small
and
large
towel
each
both
towels
are
very
light
weight
small
towel
ideal
for
rubbing
down
after
swimming
,
also
ideal
of
popping
in
bag
if
you
need
something
to
sit
on
whilst
out
and
about
larger
towels
are
ok
for
putting
on
sun
lounger
or
on
beach
easy
to
wash
out
if
needed
whilst
away
and
dry
quickly
good
value
for
money
delivery
was
good
bright
coloured
soft
towels,
quite
thin
but
this
is
good
for
the
beach
because
it
won't
trap
sand
light
and
easy
to
pack
into
suitcase
good
product
was
fast
delivery
the
towels
are
bright
happy
colours
they
feel
great
like
the
little
bag
they
come
in
ready
for
my
travels
and
the
little
thank
you
note
really
happy
with
this
product
superb
so
may
even
order
some
morethey
are
so
light
weight
you
may
want
peg
if
using
on
windy
beach
days
these
towels
are
brilliant
for
beach
holiday
they
take
very
little
space,
are
light
and
easy
to
just
have
in
your
backpack
found
them
very
absorbant,
taking
no
time
to
dry
and
easy
to
shake
sand
off
good,
am
like
it
sent
back
as
didn
realise
they
were
travel
towels
so
very
small
my
bad
for
not
reading
correctlycome
in
nice
travel
pouch
and
are
lovely
colour
and
good
texture
pretty
towels,
however
doesn't
absorb
so
well
and
takes
way
too
long
to
dry
out
excellent
product
purchased
for
swimming
and
they
are
good
size
and
very
attractive
design
would
suggest
washing
prior
to
first
use
dried
well
very
pleased
with
these
towels
however
little
overpriced
for
what
they
are
these
are
fab
dry
you
off
quickly,
the
towels
dry
quickly
&
fold
down
really
small
perfect
for
travelling,
beach
or
even
just
trip
to
the
swimming
pool
funky
designs
too
brought
do
present
bit
small
for
beach
towels
but
good
for
travelling
as
very
light
weight
and
compact
very
good
product
worth
it
for
holidays
and
travel
however,
not
suited
as
bath
towel
great
many
thanks
great
size
for
travelling
with,
great
design,
its
good
to
have
to
two
sizes
invluded
in
tje
handy
travel
bag
and
seems
to
dry
me
and
itself
pretty
quickly
absolutely
amazing
came
in
little
bag
so
will
fit
in
my
little
suitcase
absolutely
perfect
yes
it
lightyes
it
absorbentyes
it
dries
really
quicklybutthe
texture
is
very
smooth
almost
velvet
like
which
put
the
whole
family
teeth
on
edge
we
sort
of
got
used
to
it
but
we
ll
be
looking
around
to
replace
them
pretty
quickly
ve
just
got
back
from
short
beach
break
away
with
the
towel
it
was
really
light
and
compact,
useful
for
carry
on
luggage
it
doesn
pick
much
sand
off
the
beach
and
has
really
nice
colours
think
the
size
of
it
is
perfect
as
well
great
super
light
weight
beach
towels,
can't
wait
to
try
them
on
my
holiday
next
month
not
value
for

great
for
beach
towels,
if
little
bit
light
and
easy
to
fly
away
super
light
for
packing,
good
for
drying
and
overall
just
good
solution
perfect
for
travelling
and
really
handy

two
sizes
lovely

my
doubts

very
good
daughter
loves
it
very
compact,
very
effective,
dries
quickly
after
use
the
product
is
lovely
and
arrived
really
quickly
only
downside
is
they
are
really
thin
but
think
that
is
partly
my
preconceived
idea
of
what
was
going
to
receive
good
for
packing
in
suitcase
tho
great
to
get
in
case
excellent
colors
are
beautiful
and
the
water
is
well
absorbed
lovely
bright
colourful
towels
that
arrived
quickly
also
came
with
storage
bag
which
is
very
useful
many
thanks
disappointed
in
this
product
no
towel
like
properties
whatsoever,
more
like
the
material
of
table
cloth
was
not
what
we
were
expecting
to
receive
at
all
brilliant
nice
size
quality
good
better
than
expected
brilliant
for
holidays
as
so
light
so
happy
with
this
made
our
trips
to
the
beach
colourful
pack
of
and
came
in
zip
case,
even
after
washing
they
fold
away
to
the
same
size
and
go
back
in
the
zip
bag,
perfect
for
travelling
and
the
beach
love
the
colours
not
used
it
yet,
taking
it
on
holiday
with
me
bought
these
towels
to
take
abroad
they
are
amazing
super
lightweight
and
quick
drying
also
are
very
bright
print
so
are
easy
to
see
on
your
sunbed
was
gift
love
the
towels
great
service
thanks
so
much
lightweight
and
look
good
liked
everything
about
this
product,
used
it
as
beach
towel,
quick
drying,
lightweight,
very
absorbent
horrible
great
for
the
suitcase
fantastic
product
absorbent
and
lightweight
took
up
no
luggage
space
highly
recommend
these
really
are
excellent
perfect
for
holiday
light
weight
and
absorbent
and
eye
catchinh
too
thought
these
would
be
ideal
for
holiday
sadly
very
disappointed
not
absorbent
at
all
excellent
product
good
value
life
saver
great
towels
and
nice
designs
brilliant
perfetto
am
in
love
with
these
towels
so
cheap
compared
to
the
super
expensive
ones
you
see
on
instagram
but
they
still
feel
really
good
quality
the
colours
are
really
nice
and
bright
and
the
larger
towel
is
the
perfect
size
for
sitting
on
at
the
beach
or
park
and
it
rolls
up
pretty
small
so
doesn't
tale
up
much
room
the
sand
just
drops
straight
off
it
the
smaller
towel
is
also
big
enough
for
you
to
sit
on
and
is
perfect
for
if
you
don't
want
to
carry
the
bigger
one
around
like
when
am
dog
walking
both
towels
are
really
cool
design
and
look
very
on
trend,
they
are
also
super
absorbent
which
didn't
expect
when
first
took
them
out
of
the
packet
came
in
lovely
pale
blue
zip
pouch,
which
doubt
will
be
able
to
fold
so
expertly
in
again
but
handy
the
pattern
is
on
one
side
only,
the
other
is
white
pattern
and
colour
really
nice
and
bright
smaller
towel
great
size
for
hair
drying
hair,
not
as
yet
folded
the
larger
towel
as
wanted
to
keep
nice
and
tidy
in
the
pouch
for
my
holiday
looks
much
bigger
than
the
small
one
was
really
looking
for
some
good
quality,
reasonably
priced
holiday
towels
that
were
not
going
to
take
up
loads
of
space
in
our
suitcases
or
break
the
bank
these
are
perfect
great
size,
lovely
colours
and
exceptional
quality
so
good
don
want
them
to
get
usedthey
come
in
little
carry
case
which
keeps
them
all
neat
and
tidycolours
are
just
like
the
pictures
and
the
print
is
only
on
one
side
not
that
that
matters
this
twin
pack
of
large
travel
towels
arrived
in
useful
zip
top
bag
they
are
light
weight
yet
dry
really
well
will
be
taking
these
away
with
me
on
my
holiday
as
they
won
weigh
much
in
my
casethey
are
bright
and
cheerful
to
these
are
great
bought
these
for
my
daughter's
school
trip
knew
she
would
be
getting
wet
and
muddy
several
times
and
she
didn't
have
room
in
her
case
for
lots
of
towelswhen
these
arrived
was
sceptical
as
they
were
so
thin
but
also
pleased
at
how
soft
they
were
was
pleasantly
surprised
when
tried
them
myself
before
she
went
to
check
that
they
would
actually
dry
her
they
dry
very
well
and
are
perfect
for
when
you
get
out
of
the
pool
or
seathey
dry
quickly
too
so
no
soggy
towels
hanging
aroundperfect
for
her
trip
lovely
colours
on
one
side,
and
the
size
is
accurate
and
useful
didn't
expect
the
other
side
of
the
towels
to
be
entirely
white
rather
than
also
patterned,
and
the
towel
is
slightly
marked,
but
it
was
nicely
wrapped
and
arrived
quickly
ordered
these
towels
for
my
kids
to
use
on
holiday
had
previously
bought
microfiber
towels
from
much
more
expensive
brand
which
were
great
but
didn't
want
to
pay
that
much
for
kids
towels,
so
opted
for
these
and
was
not
disappointed
the
colours
were
lovely
and
vibrant,
so
easy
to
spot
around
the
pool
they
are
so
lightweight
and
took
up
almost
no
space/weight
in
the
suitcase
which
was
huge
plus
the
best
feature
however
was
the
quick
drying
time
which
is
handy
when
you're
on
holiday
and
in
and
out
of
the
pool
etc
excellent
pieces
of
kit,
these
towelssmall
light
to
pack,
absorb
loads
of
water
and
dry
in
very
short
time
one
large
enough
for
swim/bath
towel,
the
other
small
enough
for
"hand
towel"
but
still
absorbent
enough
for
after
swimming,
just
not
enough
to
cover
up
with
lovely
bright
design
so
they're
easily
spotted,
won't
be
travelling
with
ordinary
big
fat
heavy
towels
ever
again
bought
those
towels
for
our
trip
to
crete
and
decided
to
test
them
out
before
our
trip
liked
the
fact
that
towels
fit
into
small
bag
then
we
used
them
after
shower
and
described
by
some
other
buyers,
they
are
not
very
absorbent
also
red
color
in
both
towels
has
smudged
not
sure
what
to
do
now
as
we
cannot
return
them
as
we
have
used
them
horrible,
felt
like
cardboard,
took
on
holiday
and
threw
them
away
on
second
day,
had
to
buy
another
beach
towels
there,
dont
bother
with
them,
very
very
disappointed
nice
looking
towels
but
are
very
very
thin
liked
the
idea
of
having
large
one
as
beach
towel
to
lie
on
and
the
smaller
one
for
drying
offas
they
are
thin
they
do
fold
up
very
small
for
your
suitcase
and
do
not
take
up
lot
of
room
bought
it
for
my
trip
away
they
came
in
pack,
both
very
lightweight
which
is
good
for
travelling
very
bright
and
stylish
design
i've
had
better
quality
towels
before,
but
these
are
very
good
for
the
price
and
you
get
quickly
to
dry
was
was
excited
when
these
towels
arrived
before
left
for
my
holiday
to
greece
liked
the
colours,
the
size
of
them
and
the
little
bag
they
are
in
but
trying
to
dry
with
them
is
not
easy
the
fabric
does
not
soak
up
moisture
like
other
sports/travel
towels
have
had
they
become
very
soggy
and
then
do
not
dry
quickly
cannot
quite
work
out
why
more
disappointed
as
bought
set
for
friend
as
present
too
these
towels
are
really
good
for
money
my
daughter's
use
these
for
the
swimming,
and
they
are
perfect
for
putting
in
your
kit
bag
they
dry
you
really
quickly
and
perfect
for
space
saving
in
your
suit
case
great
for
holiday
or
going
to
the
swimming
baths
very
small
and
light
but
don't
rub
your
self
like
you
would
towering
towel
just
pat
you
soon
get
used
to
it
bought
these
to
take
on
our
family
holiday
and
so
glad
did
they
are
brilliant
ve
had
so
much
use
from
them
even
at
home,
great
for
taking
the
kids
swimming,

room
in
suitcase
didn't
realise

were
different
sized

good
quality
not

fit
for
purpose
so
colorful
and
lively
used
this
at
the
beach,
it
was
standing
out
from
far
apart
my
other
half
found
it
easy
to
spot
used
the
second
one
for
my
little
girl
perfect
pack
for
us
such
good
towel
the
thickness
or
should
say
thinness
may
make
you
doubt
its
drying
power
but
it
wipes
the
floor
with
any
big
thick
cotton
towel
great
pattern
and
the
for
big
one
and
bigger
one
is
great
value
it
not
towel
material
extremely
thin
and
am
disappointed
with
the
purchase
il
est
rare
de
voir
des
serviettes
en
microfibres
qui
soient
jolie
et
elle
fait
partie
des
exceptions
relativement
douce,
légère
et
pratique
rien
à
dire
c'est
super
et
encore
mieux
il
en
deux
livrées
une
grande
et
une
petite
,
ce
fut
une
bonne
surprise
:
